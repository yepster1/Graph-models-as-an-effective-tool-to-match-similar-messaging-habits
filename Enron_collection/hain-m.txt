 In the Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation, March 2001, the FERC Staff stated that its proposed mitigation proposal is designed to apply only to approximately 5% of the market that remains in real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets.  In addition, the December 15 order only established a reporting requirement for sales into the ISO and PX spot markets exceeding $150/MWh.  Under the order, the refund potential closes after 60 days of a utility filing its cost justification unless the FERC issues written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under review.  Note well that this does not entirely insulate EPMI concerning long term deals because the FERC's December 15 order is still pending rehearing and parties can appeal that order once the Commission rules. 
 By its January 8 order, the FERC clarified that it did not intend to preclude the PX from engaging in bilateral forward contracting  and that the PX was free to remove spot market components from its forward contracting rate scheduling.  In its request for rehearing, the PX argued that: (1) FERC had failed to fix a just and reasonable rate, (2) FERC did not remove the ongoing prohibition on the IOUs trading in its markets, (3) the January 8 order prohibited it from operating a spot market and that prohibition was unduly discriminatory, and (4) FERC failed to provide a viable alternative to its forward market rate schedule.  FERC dismissed the PX's request for rehearing of its January 8 order, finding that all of the PX's concerns emanate from the FERC's December 15 order not its January 8 order..   See attached order. - EL00-95.1 
 Ron - Mary has asked that the document you reference be faxed to her in Houston (she is attending meetings there).  I will be out of the office Friday.  Would you please fax the document to her at:  281-364-6274.  This is the number for the Woodlands Resort.  The phone number, in case you need it, is 281-367-1100.  Thanks, Ron  Lysa Akin 503/464-7927    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 In case you haven't seen this. 
 Here are some FERC cases I'll probably be working on in the next month: (1) In Docket No. EL00-95-?, et al. the Cal ISO and EOB's Motion for Issuance of Refund Notice and (2) Cal PX Compliance filing and request for expedited Commission guidance in EL00-95-015.  Also I'll be assisting Gary Fergus and Richard Sanders with our discussion with the ISO about reporting cost of service information.  That's about as far ahead as I can see at the moment.

 I have looked on APS' OASIS for the substations you mentioned.  The only one listed as a receipt point was Moenkopi.  Below is a list of the other receipt points available.

 FYI

 As I indicated to Jeff Golden yesterday, the problem with siting a project in APS is that it typically doesn't have any long term transmission because, in June through October, it is using the transmission to serve its native load, even to the point of selling Palo Verde and buying Four Corners uneconomically.  Accordingly, our short term traders perceive that APS sells transmission aggressively while our mid-marketers think that APS is the hardest utility to buy transmission from in the Southwest.  If you could figure out some way to sell to the market during the winter and sell to APS in the Summer it seems like that would be a good bet.  However, I would wait to talk to APS' merchant function before you submit any transmission requests to APS'  transmission function given that the traders question whether APS may try to discriminate in favor of its merchant function.  Depending on what APS' tariff says, you may have to request interconnection on-line and you have to request transmission on-line.  I will help you do this when you're ready.  I have tried to check APS' OASIS for two days in a row to find out if they have transmission for the project, but the cite was down.  I'll check again today. 
 On Tuesday, Tucson filed a complaint against the Power Exchange and Governor Davis, arguing that the FERC should render null and void the unconditional transfer of SCE and PG&E's block forward contracts.  It argues that such a transfer requires prior FERC approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act and should be conditioned by FERC to protect the public interest.  It also argues that FERC should order the PX to enforce its tariff, by requiring the PX to immediately collect from PG&E and SCE all monies due for wholesale sales to date. 
 Anyone have any brilliant ideas on how we can produce this information?  In the meantime, Sue and I can prolong having to produce the information until we negotiate a confidentiality agreement. 
 The ISO is now saying that it has the authority to require EPMI to report our prices over the price cap pursuant to Section 4.5.1of its Market Monitoring Protocol.  This provision gives the Market Surveillance Unit very broad authority to request information, specifically: "the submission of any infomration or data determined by the Market Surveillance Unit to be potentially relevant by ISO Participants, the PX or other entities whose activies may affect the operation of the ISO market."  Apparently EPMI had some December sales over the cap.  The FERC did not order us to report these December sales to FERC but the ISO is now requesting it. I think our only available approach is to provide the information to the ISO pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.  I have asked Sue Mara if she would contact WPTF about negotiating a confidentiality agreement.  Richard, please advise if this is the proper course of action.  Please note, the information is due tomorrow.    Christian Yoder 
 Because of my meeting schedule, it would be particularly helpful if this were videotaped, so I could be sure to be able to attend. 
 I am really interested in the training but will be on vacation on the 7th. Count me in next time.  Thanks for the invite. 
 By a letter in early January, the ISO told EPMI that FERC's order accepting the ISO's Tariff Amendment No. 33 had ordered EPMI to report to the ISO transactions above the price cap.  We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded that the FERC had imposed no such obligation.  We decided to do nothing rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be quoted out-of-context in the newspaper.  Moreover, it's my understanding that we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has correctly interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.  The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement actions against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above the price cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).  I could do one of several things for you at this point: Stay quiet Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt) Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and will not report unless and until we do Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSA  I am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the "Dirty 13" list) and we'll end up in the press again.  To lay low, I'm inclined to pursue options 3 or 4.  What do others think?  Traders - please verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.

 Gary Porter of Sierra called.  He was very apologetic about not sending us an interconnection agreement sooner.  Attached is a draft that has not been reviewed by Sierra's executives yet, but I talked Gary into giving it to us anyway.  Concerning our transmission request, Gary indicated that Sierra will have to perform a study because some other parties are supposedly ahead of us in the queue that would affect the available transmission capacity.  He referred me to a table on the following OASIS cite showing the competing transmission requests.  Stan or Don - please look at this table to see if you think Sierra's position has any merits.  I'll give you more details in person. Some tariff interpretation issues may also be involved depending upon whether other parties are actually ahead of us in the queue. 
 Yes. 
 I talked to Brian Whalen today.  He is trying to get an interconnection agreement finalized to send to us tomorrow.  Sierra/Nevada have abandoned their attempts to use the generation divestiture interconnection agreement they sent us before and is falling back on their old interconnection agreement, updated to reflect recent FERC orders.  Brian was very apologetic about taking so long.  He said Sierra/Nevada is also attempting to comply with our request that they send us a transmission agreement by the end of the month.  He asked me if we had gotten the Avery and Fischer reports (that would become Appendices A-C to the interconnection agreement).  I said I didn't know but that if he would E-mail them to me that I would make sure the appropriate people got them.  Lysa- when I get these reports please forward them to Don. 
 Please handle.

  Calif Senate Takes Up Bill On Deal With Small Generators ? 02/23/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Thursday.)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- California Republican Sen. Jim Battin on Thursday introduced legislation that will enable the state's electric utilities and small, independent generators to proceed with a new deal on pricing power supplies. The bill, if enacted, would lower the prices paid to so-called qualifying facilities to about 8 cents a kilowatt-hour from about 17 cents/kWh and would require California utility regulators to ensure that utilities could recover those costs from ratepayers. The new pricing would be retroactive to Feb. 1, 2001, and would run until June 30, 2006. "This bill is a linchpin to solving the California energy crisis," Battin said in a press release. Qualifying facilities produce almost 30% of California 's electricity. While the individual power plants are relatively small, some big energy companies own several qualifying facilities each in California . These owners include Calpine Corp. (CPN), FPL Group (FPL), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Ogden Corp. (OG), Thermo Electron (TMO) and MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which was bought out last year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A,BRK.B). Passage would allow several companies to restart some 1,000 megawatts of gas-fired generators that have been off line for several weeks. Those generators shut down their gas-fired plants, because they were unable to pay gas suppliers after the utilities fell behind on their power payments. The bill, SB47X, encompasses an agreement reached among the parties and is expected to be enacted. The generators and PG&E Corp's (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. reached an agreement on the new prices two weeks ago. It wasn't clear Thursday if Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison had signed off on the agreement, according to one of the lead negotiators. Edison wasn't able to comment immediately. Under the legislation, gas-fired cogeneration plants, which account for two-thirds of California 's qualifying facilities, will be paid based on the cost of signing a five-year gas supply contract. The producers will negotiate five-year contracts, subject to approval by the utilities, or accept a benchmark five-year gas price still to be determined. To take effect immediately as an emergency act, the bill requires approval by two-thirds of both the state Senate and Assembly. If the bill is passed, a process for quickly determining the five-year gas price would begin. Most of the small power plants that run on renewable sources such as solar panels, windmills and hydroelectric generators, will be paid a fixed price of 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the bill. The non-gas plants will also be paid about 2 cents/kwh for having the capacity available for the utilities. Previously, qualifying facilities were paid based on the spot price of natural gas at the California border, or, if the generator had elected, the California Power Exchange daily clearing price. But generators conceded that the California gas spot market had risen so sharply over the past six months that their power prices had become insupportable. The CalPX has stopped operating its market. Both PG&E and Edison have defaulted on qualifying facility payments, but the bill sets up a schedule for recovery of missed payments. The utilities are to pay for November 2000 deliveries by April 2, for December deliveries by May 1, and for January 2001 deliveries by June 1. PG&E paid its November bill on time. Calpine owns the most qualifying facilities in California . Of Calpine's 4,400 MW of total U.S. operational power plants, 575 MW are qualifying facilities under contract with PG&E. FPL Group's FPL Energy owns a little more than 500 MW of the plants. U.S. utilities have been forced under federal law to buy power from such generators since the oil crisis in the 1970s. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com 
 I hope you caught Lysa's error in transcribing this message.  I said you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has not accepted a rate or that a rate isn't on file.  Sorry about the double negative.  FERC usually speaks in terms of "accepting" rates rather than "setting" rates unless it has had a hearing and found that the rates being charged are unjust and unreasonable.. 
 Robin & Jeff:  Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she gave you yesterday.  Instead of saying, "It doesn't mean the FERC hasn't set a rate..." you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has accepted a rate and that a rate isn't on file".  If you have any questions about this, you can contact Mary on her cell phone (503/807-0928) AFTER 12:45pm Cnetral Time.  Lysa Akin Ass't to Mary Hain 503/464-7927

 I talked to Christian Yoder today.  He and Steve Hall will be talking tomorrow morning about whether we should file anything at FERC.  I will be on an airplane tomorrow morning so please let me know what we are doing. Thanks. 
 You might also want the attached for the Enron Joinder.  It is the most recently effective FERC Enron rate schedule (along with the FERC filing letter). 
 Today, I worked with Robin Gibbs and Jeff Alexander on an Enron pleading in the captioned case.  I asked if we had considered asking FERC Staff to file a "friend of the court" brief detailing how FERC has "occupied the field" of wholesale rate regulation.  Was this or should this be considered? 
 FYI 
 What about the questions I asked about whether the new entity would comply with Order No. 2000 (especially if the state has the vertically integrated utilities operate the system)?  See attached word version of my orginal E-mail. 
 Please print this as well.  I'm driving in now.  Thank you again. 
 If Lysa isn't there yet, would you please download these for me? Thank you. 
 Do we want to help Dynegy or do we want to file our usual letter asking for confidential treatment?

 I know we are addressing this on the state side.  I was wondering is there= =20 also a FERC angle we should prepare?  Sue and Joe: don't you think we shoul= d=20 submit an RCR to have Ron do some research on the surrounding issues?  Here= =20 are a few that came to mind. (1) What jurisdiction does FERC have over a state-owned transmission system= =20 (especially in light of Order No. 2000 and the governance of the Cal ISO on= =20 file at FERC)? (2) Is there anything FERC can do to stop the conveyance (e.g., since the= =20 utilities would have to file a Section 203 filing for approval to convey th= e=20 assets, what basis would be available to argue that conveyance was not in t= he=20 public interest.)  Should Joe explore with Hebert the Commission's=20 willingness to fight with the State about this? (3) If the State had the utilities operate the transmission system, subject= =20 to the State's control, would that comply with Order No. 2000? =20 
 Let's promote it in all these groups, just to be on the safe side. 
 This sounds like an issue we should be coordinating with the East desk too. 
 Attached find a SoCal Edison filing asking the FERC to require the Cal PX to cease and desist from liquidating or disposing its block forward contracts until FERC does an audit.  It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts back to the generators first.  It also claims that the PX could not suspend its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing.  It asks the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero.  I think we should intervene and challenge the right of first refusal part of the auction and perhaps support the cease and desist until the Commission ensures: (1) that we get a fair opportunity to participate in the auction and (2) that at least fair market value is received in the event we don't succeed in the auction.  Concerning suspending the PX DA and DO markets, I know EES was unhappy about it when it happended but, now that EES has the utilities scheduling for its retail customers, is it too late to do anything about it?  What is the significance of setting the market clearing price at zero? 
 Please start drafting the intervention, as you've described and send me an estimate for the RCR. 
 Attached please find two new Notices of Filing in Docket Nos. EL01-33 and EL01-34.  One is a request for a cease and desist order, the other a request for suspension of the underscheduling penalty.  The filings are also attached in a zip file.

 Tim said you were having a problem using our harvester to get companys/entities' ATC that aren't complying with FERC's OASIS requirements. Tim suggested that I help you resolve this.  Could you make me a list of companies/entities that aren't complying?  Then we could discuss how to address the problem with each company/entity.  Tim suggested that, to the extent we want companies to comply, we could call them and ask them to comply.  If they don't I suggested we could call the FERC hotline on a confidential basis. 
 Tim alerted everyone about this.  It's just an average for each number. 
 The following are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement.  In the sixth "whereas" (page 1) (and Sections 3.4 and 5.1.6) the contract states that either the generating company or the generating company's customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for transmission service.  In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed.  Specifically, a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability (or privity of contract) to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific.  For example, the generator may sell the power to Dynegy, who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service.  The eighth "Whereas" (page 1) (and Sections 2.18, 3.1, 31.7, E.4.1, E.4.2, E.8.2, E.8.3, E.8.4, E.8.6, E.8.7, E.11.10, E.11.11, and E.12.) state the generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability Management System (RMS) Agreement.  I would like to point out that some generators do not like to commit to the "good utility" practice standard or to be bound by the RMS agreement.  Enron has signed the RMS Agreement.  I doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility practice standard.  This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and, in order for RTO West to form, BPA must agree to join.  Enron is very interested in RTO West forming. If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard, we had better develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable alternative standard.  Section 1.1  Contrary to our requests, this section still states that the agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become effective.   This is not the way the OATT operates.  Rather, if Enron and Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement, Enron asks Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC (as we have done) and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierra's open access tariff.  Service here is governed by the transmission open access tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT applies.  The FERC has determined that filings under Section 212 (and therefor 211) of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the customer simply requests service under the OATT.  Requiring the customer to wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would completely  undermine the purpose of Order No. 888.  Section 1.2 After, "by both parties" add "however, if the parties cannot agree to execute this agreement, System Owner shall file this agreement unexecuted with FERC as provided by the terms of the OATT."  Section 1.6.2   Three years advance written notice is too long.  A reasonable notice period would be ____.  Section 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 EPMI opposes the definitions of "Applicable Laws" "Applicable Permits" and "Applicable Reliability Criteria" because, when combined with their use throughout the contract (in Sections 2.6, 3.5, 3.10, 3.11, 5.6.2, 5.6.3, 8.4.2, 11.8, E.2.8, E.3.3, E.4.1, E.4.3, E.4.4, and E.9.5) they subject EPMI to legal and regulatory risk by consenting to amendment of the contract by government action.  Section 2.19 Section (i) of the definition of "Dispatch gives Sierra too much control over the generating unit by allowing it to redispatch for "the most reliable" supply.  Change "the most reliable" to "a reliable"  Section 2.31 Is inconsistent with Sierra's OATT.  It should be written using the same words as the OATT.  Section 2.52  The reference to Section 22.1 should be corrected to 21.1.  Section 2.56 Definition of "System Integrity" is too broad.  When combined with Section 3.13.2, it would require our generator to not "have an adverse impact on "maximiz[ing] the health, welfare, safety of personnel and the general public."  While Sierra can voluntarily do so with its own facilities, there is no reliability or governmental requirement that we do so and we should not.  Section 3.5 The proposed Use of "System Integrity" here is more fair assuming EPMI agrees to the "Good Utility Practice" standard.  Section 3.7 Shouldn't the word "unplanned" be added before the word Outages?  Section 3.8 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it would be directly assigned the cost of facilities that are being used by others.  Section 3.10 The second sentence exposes EPMI  to regulatory risk by allowing Sierra to add new facilities and charge them to EPMI.    This risk is increased by the last sentence which allows Sierra to determine the need for such facilities in its sole discretion.  Editorial note: the third to last sentence is missing a period.  Section 3.13.2 See comments under Section 2.56.  Section 4.1 EPMI opposes the first sentence because it gives Sierra an opportunity to have FERC order additional payments for the same level of service already provided by this contract.  Accordingly, the words "or ordered by FERC" should be deleted.  EPMI opposes the second sentence because it would allow Sierra, with FERC's approval, to allocate to EPMI costs incurred for Sierra property and for operation of Sierra's facilities  Section 4.3 Should the words "generating company's applicable FERC-approved tariff" be changed to "Applicable Law?"  Section 5.1.1 EPMI opposes the last sentence because it would presumably require EPMI to pay more than cost for any project whose scope does not increase by more than 10 percent.  Under FERC's precedent, EPMI is only required to pay actual cost.  Section 5.1.3 Nine months seems like to long a time to wait to provide a final invoice.  The words "plus Interest" should be added after the words "difference" in the fourth sentence.  Section 5.6.2 This section says essentially the same thing as Section 3.10 and EPMI opposes it for the same reasons.  Section 6.4.3 Add period at end of sentence.  Section 7.1 Delete period after the word "and" in last sentence.  Section 8.1.4 Add period after "Interconnection Facilities."  Section 8.4.2 EPMI opposes paying for all modifications to interconnection facilities to the extent that such modifications benefit Sierra or third parties.  Section 8.7.2 Delete the word "and" on the seventh line.  Section 9.1.1 See comments under Sections 2.56.  Section 11.7 Delete "pen-nits" from last line on page and insert "permits."  Section 11.8  After "remediation or abatement activity" insert "pay all fines, penalties, or compensations as required by law."  Section 13.4 There should be a reciprocal provision for generators.  Section 16.2 EPMI opposes "regulatory" Force Majeure.  Section 16.6 This provision is too broad in that it allows the System Operator to evaluate the alternatives available to the EPMI.  Section 17.9 Add the letter "y" after "and ma" on the second line.  Section 19.2.1 Third to last line change "ahs" to "has."  Section 19.3 Needs to be edited.  Section 19.6 This section subjects EPMI to the regulatory risk of amendment to the interconnection agreement to conform to an RTO's requirements.  Section 22.5 By law, System Operator should be required to file with FERC prior to terminating the connection.  Section 31.8  This section exposes EPMI to regulatory risk because it allows Sierra to unilaterally file with FERC to change the terms and conditions of the interconnection contract.  This is standard in utility tariffs and agreements and in fact is in the FERC's pro forma OATT under Order No. 888.  Section 31.9 of the contract retains EPMI's rights to protest any unilateral filing by Sierra under Section 31.8 and seems to balance the rights given to Sierra in Section 31.8 by allowing EPMI to file a complaint challenging any of the rates, terms, or conditions, etc., of the interconnection agreement.  Exhibit D D.1.1 EPMI should not be required to provide free station service to the extent it benefits Sierra Pacific or third parties.  A higher level of service should not simply be at the election of the System Owner but rather at the agreement of the Parties.  D.1.2 The phrase "Except under Applicable Law," should be added before the first sentence.  D.2 EPMI opposes providing free VArs and opposing providing VArs at a level determined by Sierra's discretion.  Accordingly, EPMI opposes this entire provision.  If Sierra wishes to purchase VArs, EPMI would agree to provide ______ level of VArs at ____ rate.  EPMI would also agree to provide VArs at Sierra's discretion, subject to this rate, in the case of an Emergency. Otherwise, EPMI would be foregoing the opportunity to provide real power (instead of VArs) to the market at a market-based rate, and it might be subject to having such transactions cut at Sierra's "discretion" without being assured the cost of cover.  Accordingly, the rate standard of cost or foregone revenues would not be compensatory.  D.3 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it could be read to require EPMI to provide free Black Start Service.  D.4 Since the generator is not taking the delivery portion of transmission service, it is not required to buy or self provide any ancillary service including regulation and frequency response service of real-time load -following service.  Accordingly, this provision should be deleted.  D.5 EPMI opposes the second sentence of this paragraph and it should be deleted.  Sierra should get ancillary services from the market.  E.2 Change "minimized" to "minimize."  E.2.4 Oppose requirement to notify Sierra of defects in generator "may affect System Integrity."  E.4.1.3 EPMI opposes giving the Control Area Operator authority to "approve" Planned Outage Schedules.  E.4.4 Once again EPMI would oppose the use of the term "System Integrity" here as too high as standard.  E.6.5 The second sentence gives the Control Area Operator too broad authority to preclude Planned Outages.  E.7.1 Add the word "the" on line 4 after "at."  E.8.1 EPMI opposes requiring the Generator to receive prior Control Area Operator authorization to undertake any action that is "reasonably likely to have an adverse impact of System Integrity," especially adjustment of the amount of real and reactive power it delivers to the Transmission system under E.8.1.1.  E.8.2.2 Because VArs could be sold as real power, System Control should not be allowed to "establish the range of voltages or voltage schedules." Rather, Sierra Pacific should negotiate with EPMI to buy the level of voltage support it requires.  See also E.8.9 establishing power factors.  E.8.4 EPMI does not have a problem with operating its AGC within WSCC limits but it will not be providing this Ancillary Service free to Sierra.  We need to negotiate compensation.  E.8.6 Giving Sierra "sole discretion" to determine "unacceptable deterioration of the quality of service over its Transmission System" is too broad.  E.9.2 "Repots" should be "reports"

 Here's the answer to your question about paragraphs 42 and 44 of Duke's complaint.  Although CDWR is technically the SC for the UDCs in the short term bilateral market and the ISO, as a practical matter, if CDWR does not like the prices offered in the bilateral market, it waits to buy the power from the ISO.  Then  CDWR reviews the price of the ISO's purchases and (according to an article in Megawatt daily) it "does not authorize the payment at prices it deems unreasonable."

 Attached find two drafts, one a redline/strikeout and the other a clean first draft of the RTO West tariff glossary.  In addition to making the changes we discussed to the Transmission Operating Agreement, I also took the liberty of adding a number of definitions that I cribbed from the FERC pro forma (changing "Transmisison Provider" to "RTO West" where applicable).  I recognize that some of these definitions may not be applicable to the new types of transmisison service but I thought if we made these definitions available to the technical groups they could tell us if they needed them and we would be assured that terms were used consistently with the FERC pro forma and throughout the RTO West tariff.

 I hope you saw this.  I was out of the office and unable to get my E-mails. 
 Steve Walton has suggested the following definitions concepts for definitions of "Congestion Zone" and "Flowpath"  Congestion Zone - Segment of Electric System within which there is minimal congestion between busses.  Flowpath - A facility or set of facilities that represent commercially significant constraints within the transmission system.  As we discussed, Steve affirmed that these are terms of art. 
 Although I haven't seen this yet, I agree, this sounds like something we want to support.  Alan would you unzip for me?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I thought you might want to be the Tariff Integration group's liason to the Provisions/Requirements Content Group since that group is dealing with interconnection issues.

 Here's a really interesting service summarizing ISO activities.  Also read the content about governance and confidential information.

 Notice of your termination filing is attached. 
 Depending on how negotiations go with Sierra, at the end of the month, we may need to make a FERC filing for interconnection and transmission service. 
 Is this okay? 
 Here's a copy of what we filed at FERC today. 
 Georgia Pacific and Bellingham Cold Storage are also large Puget customers. Attached for your information is a settlement they executed with Puget. 
 Chris Foster asked me for help with a Puget Sound Energy tariff that would allow us a quasi direct access to Puget's largest customers.  In response to his request I am sending him information about who the customers are, so he can contact them. 
 Air Liquide et al v. PSE  Formal Complaint - Docket UE-001952  This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of a "soft cap" on prices PSE charges some large customers.  On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint answer on the rate cap mechanism.  On Jan. 22, the UTC approved a temporary "soft-price" cap for power rates paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power costs if the utility was paying more than a maximum level.  The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the level of the temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and the PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place pending further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48.  Puget's 13 large industrial customers are: Boeing, Georgia-Pacific, Air Liquide America Corp. CNC Containers, Equilon Enterprises, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Tesoro Northwest, City of Anacortes, Intel Corp., King County's Metro Wastewater Treatment Division, Olympic Pipe-Bayview, Qwest and MCI WorldCo

 I have only a couple of suggestions.  See red-line strike-out attached.  On the GenTie Agreement, are we not concerned about the results of third party review?  If we are, we should have the same third party review language (with my revision) as in the FS Agreement. 
 Here's the right version.  I've deleted the earlier version.  Sorry about any confusion. 
 Attached find a letter to Sierra Pacific about our transmission and interconnection requests.  Due to Nevada Power's dilatory tactics to date and the pendancy of financing for the project, Ed, Don, Stan, Jim G., and I agree that the letter takes the necessary tone and should ask Sierra to file with FERC the agreements (unexecuted) if Sierra doesn't give EPMI an executable contracts by 2/28/01.  If we are going to make this demand we need to send this letter ASAP. 
 I'd like to clean this up a little more but here is my first crack on what we should send.  I left in two paragraphs that are repetitive that relate Stan's conversation with Nevada Power in September.  Stan would you draft these two paragraphs together and make them factully correct?  Thanks. 
 Attached find key provisions of the CTS tariff that may be useful in discussions in the next couple of days. 
 In case you weren't aware.  The call is about joining a FERC filing with PacifiCorp about the PX's recent actions. 
 Please E-mail me and Jim Steffes the document to be discussed on the 11:00 a.m. conference call tomorrow. 
 I'm sure Enron's stockholders would want Enron to join a filing to allow Enron to participate in discussions between the PX and the Chairman of FERC (and to oppose any ex parte communications) about whether the PX holds Enron's money.  I would be interested in going to the discussion too.

 Although I don't yet have all the facts, Steve Hall said that late yesterday (Friday) afternoon, the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX participants.  I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two possible ways this action is unlawful.  First, this violates the banking provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6).  These provisions requires the PX to hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.  Second, these are wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent domain concerning retail service.  I don't have any law to support the second idea but think it should be researched nonetheless. 
 Please ignore fax.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Here's my solution.  FERC should tell the Cal ISO to file the stakeholder developed congestion management proposal arguing that it has been agreed to in the stakeholder process and that the ISO Board has no authority to do something else because they are not properly constituted.  We could also argue that the FERC should order the ISO executives to hire a consulting firm that will propose a slate of candidates and argue for a government similar to what has been proposed for RTO West.  This will help us in ultimately putting the West RTOs together. 
 Please deal with this.  I never saw a document from you on the last public record request.  Please advise. 
 I am under the impression that we still need to file the attached protest to a 12/13/00 Cal PX FERC filing that would (in the PX's interpretation) allow them to confiscate our collateral in the Block Forward Market to satisfy the defaults of other participants in the PX markets.  Please let me know if we don't need to file this.  Please give me your comments on the draft ASAP. 
 Correct.  I wanted to terminate CTS for EPMI too but others decided this issue.  Sorry if there was any confusion.  Please make a filing for Portland General, consistent with their letter to the PX.  I am still waiting to hear from Enron Wind.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Do you want to get this or are you already an in-house compendium? 
 We filed with FERC today a final version of this (which I don't yet have). We need to discuss Enron Wind doing the same.  Also, you'd need to send a letter to the PX terminating your particiaption agreement.  I'll send you the letter we sent.  I'm assuming you would want to get out of the CTS market as well as the Day-ahead and Day-of.  Call me ASAP 503-464-8862.  Thanks.

 I'm looking into whether we have to make a filing for EES too. 
 Christian asked me to work with Dan Watkiss to prepare a FERC filing to terminate EPMI's participation in the PX.  I have asked Dan to get started as Christian said we may decide to file as soon as today.  See attached explanation.  Does EES also have a participation agreement?  And if so do we also need to file a termination for EES? 
 Richard Sanders just called me from the court house.  Please do not release any information about the TRO until we hear otherwise from Richard.  Thanks. 
 The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving PG&E's recent reorganization.  Obviously by this reorganization, PG&E is attempting to shield its assets in the event of a bankruptcy.  I'm wondering if we should become active in this case, to protect our interests in the event of a bankruptcy.

 The available transmision capacity (ATC) "derate" did occur and has occured everydaysince about the 24th.  This fact was verified to me by our ISO customer contact on Friday.  Although we do not have the E-mails anymore, the ISO sends our traders E-mails everyday about the ATC on the ties, so this information is verifiable with the ISO.  Our customer contact didn't know exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more with the ISO, not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged.  The reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage 3 emergency.  The line was again rated at zero today.  I have been pursuing the following approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved.  I've talked to Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston.  Eric believes he can get the press to investigate and divulge this information for us in the trade press.  So check the trade press tomorrow. 
 I've called Eric Thode in our Houston office and if he's successful, there will be something in the trade press about this issue soon.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 At Joe's request I called Scott Miller at FERC.  Scott asked me to write up our issues for him (as he was on his cell phone kayaking on the Chesapeake). 
 At your request, here's a write-up of our problems with the ISO.  Issue 1 - Concerning the intertie going North out of California into the Northwest (NW) at the California Oregon Border (COB), since about the 24th of January, the ISO has started telling market participants that the available transmission capacity, which is usually 2300 MW, is zero.  Last Friday, this caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about $50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day. This transmission capacity is within the ISO's control and, because capacity is available, the ISO's actions seem to violate Order No. 888.  I also wonder what would happen if another control area decided they were going to take similar action.  This hurts Enron financially because we own FTRs and if there is no congestion, we don't get paid anything.  This is like "economic" force majeure.  The reason the ISO is listing zero ATC is that they're in a Stage 3 Emergency and they're not offering sufficient price/credit terms to get the power they need.  California obviously thinks its power needs are more important than the NW's.  Issue 2 - We have transmission we are purchasing from some California munis using transmission facilities that are not part of the Cal ISO.  The ISO advised today that they are thinking about cutting exports from California. We are concerned that the ISO will cut our transaction even though it uses transmission assets and rights that are not under the ISO's control.  If our deal were cut, it could cost us $20,000 to $100,000 per hour (we have a 125 MW deal and spreads now are $125 and they would likely blow out more if exports were cut).   We hesitate to call the ISO and ask if they are going to cut us because we are afraid we might suggest something that they haven't thought of.  I'd be happy to answer any questions.  I'm at (503) 464-8862. 
 In addition to the ISO derating its own available transmission capacity (exporting) at the California Oregon Border (so that people can't buy transmission from the ISO to export power) the ISO is now threatening to cut our exports from California using transmission rights that we have purchased from a muni that is not part of the ISO's grid.

 We are trying to get long term transmission service from Sierra Pacific for LV Cogen.  Sierra Pacific claims that numerous parties are ahead of us in the queue.  We disagree (for some fairly complex technical reasons that I won't detail here).  Sierra Pacific won't offer us transmission service until it resolves the requests that are ahead of us in the queue.  At this time, we are planning to keep the project and may have difficulty getting financing if we can't get the transmission service.  It is my understanding that we have exhausted all negotiating opportunities with Sierra to resolve this issue.  I would like to have Bracewell and Patterson draft a FERC filing to resolve this issue.  However, I have been told that EPMI cannot make such a filing due to the pending merger.  Paul and Sarah - I'd like to confirm that we have indeed exhausted all negotiating opportunities and that we can't file anything against Sierra. 
 I've told the traders about this. 
 You asked me to know about any ISO Board activities.  Sue left me a voice mail saying she went to the last Board meeting and they didn't do much. There will be another meeting February 1 9:00-6:00, although Sue's not sure she'll be going.  According to the web the agenda is as follows:  GENERAL SESSION 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. 1) Public Comment 2) Overview of ISO Financial, Legal & Regulatory Activities 3) Review of Administrative Procedures & Responsibilities of the Board 4) How the Transmission System Works 5) Review of Current Issues Facing California and the ISO 6) Functions of the ISO 7) Review of California Markets & ISO's Responsibilities  EXECUTIVE SESSION 5:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m. 1) Discussion of Legal Issues Concerning Impending Market Activity 2) Review of Compensation Goals for 2000 3) Review of Current Investigations of the ISO  I did not see any motions or papers that are posted for consideration at this time.  To review General Session agenda documents as they appear online go to: http://www.caiso.com/pubinfo/BOG/documents/ Audio of this meeting is provided via RealAudio on the Internet. For information, please go to: http://www.caiso.com/pubinfo/BOG/ All public documents, notices, and information are posted to the Web site as they are provided to the Board of Governors.

 Your ideas about decertifying the Cal ISO are very interesting but I question your likelihood of success given FERC's lack of political will (thanks to George W.'s new leadership ) to sue the ISO to get rid of the newly-appointed ISO board.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Please disregard my last E-mail.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

 Here is my idea for challenging the new ISO Board.  According to the trade press, one of the ISO Board's first actions will be to file with FERC to request more time to act on the FERC's requirement to file a market redesign.  We (or WPTF) would file a protest asking the FERC to reject the filing because the ISO does not have the authority to act. 
 It was derated by 3200 MW, raising Mid-Columbia prices by $50-75/MWh.  It's not effecting Cal ISO's return of power because that power is flowing on different transmission, from the Nevada Oregon Border north, not from the California Oregon border North. 
 Craig, - In addition, it is our understanding that the ISO has not cut transmission capacity to Southern California, although that action would have the same effect as cutting transmission to the north.  Jim - I have forwarded this information to Paul & Alan so they can pursue this issue with the Governors.  Could we also give this information to Clearing Up, if they promised not to quote us?  Do you think that would be helpful? 
 From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power (under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.  I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more difficult for him to balance his budget.  The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't think we want to encourage that.  What do you think?  Call me. 
 I have drafted the attached letter denying the Cal ISO's request to send it (and the EOB) EPMI and EES' cost information for transactions over the FERC's cost cap.  Since I believe we are on very firm ground, my initial inclination was to send no response to the ISO's letter, so there would be nothing to quote in the press.  However, I drafted this letter at Alan's suggestion for purposes of discussion.  We should decide whether to send a letter before distributing this draft more widely in-house to discuss how to parse the message. 
 Christi - Cara has E-mailed a number of questions to Linda and Kelley.  If she doesn't hear from them by tomorrow morning, can Cara and I have a conference call with you at 11:00 a.m. Pacific time so you can birddog people and get some answers?

 The Mercury News requested the CPUC subpoena.  What can we do to fight this (assuming there's anything we can do and we want to)? 
 Did Tim already send you these documents for your review?  If he did, have you been working with the Houston group on them or do you want to tell me about any problems? 
 I thought we did not like the government of Desert Star (because it's ruled by the publics and the federal government) and did not like other aspects of it as much as we liked aspects of RTO West.  Why not wait until we get RTO West formed and then argue that the rest should be consolidated into it?  If we try to argue that California should join Desert Star it would be sort of like the tail wagging the dog and I would be concerned that California would try to take over.  Besides with RTO West, we have an organization that at least one Federal Power Marketer has said they could join. 
 I sent this to my friend at FERC.  Souldn't we be opposing this? 
 Hi!  Hope all is well.  FYI - --   Subject:  AG suit to oust ISO Board  ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES TO REMOVE STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS OF ISO BOARD Seeks To Allow Replacement By Consumer-Oriented Members  January 23, 2001 01-006 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  (SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Lockyer today filed suit to have the 26 stakeholder members of the California Independent System Operator Corporation vacate their office, seeking to pave the way for a newly reconstituted board representing the interests of consumers.  The "quo warranto" action was filed in Sacramento County Superior Court. The lawsuit asks the court to have the 26 sitting ISO members ousted from their positions. The Attorney General has offered current members an opportunity to resign and avoid further litigation.  The legal move seeks to speed implementation of the new law, AB 5X, which reconstitutes the ISO into a board of five members appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Electricity Oversight Board.  Governor Davis has appointed the five new members of the ISO governing board pursuant to the new law.  The ISO board is responsible for operating, controlling and managing the power transmission lines that deliver electricity throughout California and between neighboring states. 
 This is not public information yet but, assuming Tim gives his final okay, a guy will be joining the trading floor to develop a renewable market including a portfolio, trading, an index, auction, an Enron Online product, etc.  He wants to formulate a well developed regulatory policy approach and has agreed to draft up some bullet points for our use and has had preliminary meetings with various groups in Houston including Jeff Keeler.  He also wants to enlist the assistance of government affairs.  I suggested he do a presentation at our next government affairs meeting.  Are we still having people do presentations at our meetings?  Could we fit him in? 
 I want verification from Tim, Chris Calger, and you that working on the RTO West tariff and generation interconnect agreement is consistent with my "new narrower role" as regulatory attorney for the West power desk and the apporpriate priority for use of my time.  Should I ask them now or should I wait until after we meet next week?

 The public power person who wrote the article Sean is discussing has always been opposed to RTO West and was just seizing another opportunity to oppose it.  The FERC staff is no less commited to RTOs, and I'm sure the IOUs are no less committed for that reason.  In addition, I doubt FERC Commissioners in the new administration will back-track on RTO formation especially because of what has happened in California (how the state took too much control of ISO formation and control). 
 FYI.  Lysa can we talk about this? 
 Leslie, would you please put these numbers together for us?  Valerie said she would work with you on it.  Thanks. 
 I wonder if a court would give this any credence? 
 NPC still has not sent this. 
 See attached E-mail from Paul.  As Paul discusses a bunch of us in the West have not done internal resource reports since about September.  Anyway, in response to Paul's E-mail, I have done a report.  Does our group do these reports?  If so who puts together the report for our group? 
 As we discussed, here are some recent papers we have filed with FERC that will help you learn our positions and arguments on various issues, including price caps. 
 Christi said that Dan should work on this because he knows the history.  Jim approved it. Can you give me a budget amount?  Thanks. 
 Mary Hain will be attending dinner at Cucina Cucina    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 CalISO filed a tariff to charge scheduling coordinators FERC's annual charge.  The ISO should charge end users (transmission customers).  As you know we just got FERC to rule that marketers don't have to pay the annual charges.  Tim wants to protest.  Protests due 1/19!  Please respond ASAP.

 This E-mail is about a couple of issues I thought we might start coordinating on.  As I mentioned to you this morning Paul, I thought you should be aware that Craig Gannett is planning to attend the NW governor's roundtable (that you will be attending) to monitor it for Cynthia.  I just found this out yesterday.  I will not be attending.  In addition, here's a version of a paper Craig Gannett is working on recommending changes to help solve the energy crisis for the NW.  Craig has been working on this with Cynthia Sanderr and I believe has circulated this paper in draft form to some degree on the Hill.  I have not given Craig any comments on the paper as yet. 
 This looks fine.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Attached find the Cal ISO's Order No. 2000 filing.  It basically proposes nothing 
 I will also be in the TOA and maybe the Tariff review group.  Thanks.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 The ISO has sent us the attached letter saying that we are required to file with it (and the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB)) our reports of prices over the soft cap.  It cites to it's Amendment 33 filing as authority.  The ISO's proposed tariff did not include any such requirement, rather it asked the Commission to so order.  Although the FERC approved Amendment 33, the FERC's order on the filing makes no mention of such requirement.  I would like Dan or Ron to advise whether this allows us to avoid filing this information with the ISO and EOB.  I will also be asking members of EPSA what they plan to do during the conference call tomorrow. 
 Thanks you for the quick turn around.  I saw half a dozen typos but otherwise it looks good.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Sorry I just sent you an E-mail in error.  Please ignore.

 Do first thing. 
 What do you think?    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 Is EES asking for too much here (especially extending the rate freeze)? =20 Wouldn't it be better to get this thing resolved (assuming that's possible)= ? 
 I'd like to expand on the last point.  The Market Monitoring Committee (MMC) should not make findings, it should simply refer the information it gets to FERC about abuse of market power and violations of antitrust and if should report that information subject to confidentiality.  Also, if contrary to our wishes, the FERC allows market monitoring committees to further investigate, make findings, and impose penalties, FERC must require the tariffs to contain detailed due process requirements that: (1) specifically name the behavior that is illegal and relate any penalties to specific violations, (2) require the MMC to notify the party being invested of the tariff or law that may have been violated, (3) allow the party being investigated to perform discovery on any other party (including the ISO or the PX) that may instead be at fault or may be a contributing party, (4) to facilitate this discovery, allow a party to know the identity of the party (if any) that alerted the MMC to the alleged violation, and (5) detail the process for any discovery, hearing, or ADR process to ensure the party being investigated has adequate notice and opportunity to be heard and to impute others who may instead be at fault.    Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 
 I am back in the office.  I assume you are handling this and will let me see a copy of the draft.  Thanks. 
 According to the guys on the desk, EPMI has 5-10 end user customers in Montana (for example Smurfit, Stone and others). 
 I drafted the attached at Alan's request.  Alan, I hope it's close to what you had in mind. 
 FYI 
 Based on a discussion I had with Tim, we should report out-of-market transactions with the FERC and should not question the ISO about their reporting out-of-market transactions for the following reasons:  Even though the Commission's order referred only to bids into the ISO, it was not artfully written.  Otherwise FERC would not get any reporting information necessary for refunds. We have always said that out-of-market should be more transparent and more liquid.  As long as this information is withheld from the market, these goals will not be achieved. Nor will the Commission's goal of moving volumes out of the spot market be achieved if parties can simply withhold from the spot market and sell out-of-market without FERC scrutiny.

 Shouldn't we protest this filing at FERC?  Otherwise we'll have to track on a day-to-day basis whether we should sell to the ISO. 
 Thanks.  I already got mine. 
 Please handle this.  Call me with any questions. 
 No we don't typically intervene in CTS filings.

 Pithy. 
 Typically the traders are not interested in changes to the TAC because it i= s=20 paid by the end-user not by us.  However, EES folks (Dennis Benevides, Neil= =20 Bresnan, and Jubron Whelan) are usually interested and you can copy the=20 traders with an FYI if you want to.  You have probably discovered all this= =20 already. 
 No we're not interested in intervening.  This filing is to carry out the settlement I negotiated.  I'm the person on the floor who is familiar with the services we purchase.

 Mary will be working from home today.  She is also available on cell.  I do not know when she will return to the office, but will update you as I receive more information.  Lysa 503/464-7927 
 I wished to review the filing (especially the TOA) and comment along the=20 lines we have before.  Unfortunately, I did not have time to read the filin= g=20 before leaving for vacation.  I left the filing on my desk.  Hope you had a= =20 happy holiday.  I don't know if Lysa told you but my mother in law died the= =20 day before Christmas so I will be taking off Jan. 4 & 5th to attend the=20 memorial on the East Coast.  I'll be checking my E-mails periodically. 
 Yes please.  Thanks. 
 Charles, I'm sorry I've taken so long to get back to you on this.  Since I didn't have time to analyze your paper, please see the attached paper on the release of information in an RTO.  Also, talk to Alan, I think he provided further support for our recommendations in an affidavit he filed at FERC. Also, please work with Alan about your comments on page 5.  Alan, if you respond through E-mails please copy me.  Thanks. 
 Joe Attached find the report you requested.  Alan - Governor Davis offered a highly discounted forward contract ($45-50/MWh) at the FERC settlement conference today.  As usual, California is trying to get its refund with or without FERC requiring it.  Alan - Tim and Joe will likely need your assistance with this settlement negotiation.

 I agree with Sue.  In fact, I don't even think we need to intervene given that the ISO did not file a tariff that would become effective.  So unless Tim wants to help out the ISO with a supportive filing . . . . 
 Is there anything we can do to address circumstances where we are required to bid into the ISO pursuant to the DOE's Section 202(c) order - especially for the fixed price customers? 
 Please review attached letter to customers ASAP.  Make sure you copy Steve Hall on your comments. 
 We have put together the following list of issues for the request for rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order.  We would appreciate your input about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA).  Requests for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001.  We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit $150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?) Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts. The FERC should clarify its statement that "to the extent the IOUs' resources exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules."  A literal interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their generation and load is located.  We don't care about the IOUs trading options but we are concerned about less liquidity. Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs. We oppose the 27-month refund period We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF) The FERC should not have rejected Dynegy & Reliant complaint concerning being paid the cost of cover for exports 
 I have thrown together the following list of issues that people have raised so far:  Opportunity Costs under the soft cap $150 too low Benchmarks for Forward contracts Regulation of long term sales Preemption of PUC "buy" requirement Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power PUC's request for protective order

 Cool Christmas gift!  Thank you.  Attached is my feeble attempt at returning the favor. 
 I'd like to set up a call for this afternoon to discuss the FERC's order, in general.  Also, in an hour or so I'll also be forwarding a proposed issue list on rehearing so we can talk about it.

 FYI. Today we received the attached letter forwarded by Gary Fergus (our attorney on the California Attorney General investigation) from the California Attorney General.  This letter is a protocol for retaining electronic evidence. 
 Yes we do care.  The question is: are we going to do anything?  Robin and Richard will be discussing this this afternoon.  The CPUC's motion only applied to the generators, not the ISO.  I guess the ISO was viewed as cooperating. 
 FYI 
 As I mentioned on the phone, SCE moved FERC (in the FERC docket investigati= ng=20 the California market) for a subpoena to produce information from the ISO's= =20 Market Surveillance Committee.  In particular, SCE is requesting informatio= n=20 that the MSC referenced in its December 4, 2000 report to the FERC, wherein= =20 it stated that "MSC stands ready to provide the Commission with what we=20 suspect are instances of the exercise of significant market power by specif= ic=20 market participants.  We encourage not only the Commission, but other law= =20 enforcement agencies as well, to use their authority to request from these= =20 market participants the necessary information to confirm whether these=20 suspicions about the exercise of significant market power are in fact=20 correct."  The MSC also stated that it "could provide a number of instances= =20 of what it suspects are suspicious bidding and scheduling behavior during t= he=20 summer and Autumn of 2000."  Here's an outline of the positions I think we should make in an answer:  The Commission should reject SoCal Edison's request for a subpoena because= =20 FERC did not set its investigation for hearing.  Therefore, SCE's request i= s=20 a collateral attack on the Commission's order establishing the process for= =20 its investigation in this case.  Further, it would allow Edison to access= =20 this information to pursue its case against power marketers while denying= =20 marketers an opportunity to prosecute their cases by denying them an equal= =20 opportunity to serve discovery upon others (including the UDCs). In the alternative, the Commission should allow all parties full discovery= =20 rights and establish an appropriate protective order. There may also be an argument that, since the MSC has delegated its authori= ty=20 by FERC, some of the information Edison requested might fall under the=20 deliberative process privilege.  Gary Fergus suggested this argument.  Not= =20 having done any legal research, I don't know how good of an argument it is.  Are there any other arguments we should make?  Should we have a conference= =20 call on this?  Jim suggested that we should try to have WPTF file this answ= er=20 and I agreed.  At first, I was thinking that it would be okay for Ron to=20 draft the answer for WPTF.  However, on further consideration, if we end up= =20 wanting to argue that another member of WPTF exercised market power,=20 Bracewell would have a conflict of interest that would prohibit it from=20 representing us.  Accordingly, WPTF should use other counsel.

 I'm not sure whether we want Hoecker to make the fourth point.  What do others think? 
 I will not be attanding this meeting as I understand you both will be.  I'm sure we have many other specific concerns (and I am reviewing the amended supplemental compliance filing as I'm sure you are).  However, I think our key concern is returning to a stakeholder process.  Since the utilities first filing, we haven't been allowed to be at the table.  This violates Order No. 2000.

 Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the following information by the end of the day today:  How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day or as of midnight? How much of the gas went into California? What was the average price or the high and low price?  I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down. I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268. 
 Here are my corrections/concerns/questions about the EPMI portion of the filing.  We need to coordinate this with PGE and Enron Wind and make sure they file to revise their tariffs and agree to the change of the code of conduct.  Are you handling that Sarah or do you want me to? The filing and tariff do not include the Commission approved FTR sales into California, that needs to be added. Do we have any idea how close the SEC is to ruling?  It's my recollection that FERC does not like indefinite notice periods, as we have requested, nor, under their rules, do they permit a notice period of longer than 120 days. Has counsel looked at whether FERC has made special exceptions for mergers?

 On 10/27/00, FERC issued two orders that clarify procedures for requesting long term transmission.  (Morgan Stanley v. Ill. Powerand Tenaska Power v. SPP).  In both cases, the customer requested long term (year or greater) transmission service and in both cases, the ATC was insufficient to award the entire request.  Transmission Providers, Ill. Power and SPP treated partial service differently.  In these orders FERC holds:  A transmission provider (TP) is NOT required to offer short term service in response to a long term request.  Section 19.7 of the pro forma OATT only obligates the TP to tell the customer how much partial Long Term service could be provided.  Examples: -- Customer requests 300 MW long term transmission service for one year.  TP replies that it can offer 200 MW for the entire year. -- Customer requests 2 year service for 300 MW.  TP replies that it can offer 300 MW for one year. -- Customer requests 300 MW for one year.  TP can only provide 300 MW for summer months.  TP is NOT obligated to provide customer the 3 months service.  Furthermore, an annual request for 300 for some months and 0 MW for others is NOT a valid long term request.  What Customer is then doing is really submitting a short term request for 300 for summer only -- a new short term request must be submitted to obtain the summer transmission.  While the TP is not required to respond with short term availability in response to a long term request, FERC did footnote to Ill. Power that it thinks it is a helpful idea for the TP to alert the customer to what ATC is available so the customer can submit a short term request if it wishes. 
 Diana - are you tracking this? 
 We wouldn't be a generation only control area.  Our load is Valley Electric. My bigger worry is how do we meet our generation requirement if we sell off LV Cogen.  Also, when the RTO forms, all control areas will be consolidated, at least if their transmission is in RTO West. 
 Usually, ENA legal hires outside counsel, but I'd be happy to assist you and outside counsel on it.  I don't know who legal typically uses although I'm pretty sure Dale used Dan Watkiss of  Bracewell and Patterson for one project.
