 The "silent one" speaks. 
 Yes, yes.  Sorry for not replying.  I'm good for two. 
 Thank you very much for your help. 
 Amy,  Hi.  This is Richard's, and now Erin's, friend Clint.  I know that she spoke with you about me, and I wanted to see if you might be interested in getting together sometime.  You probably want to know a little about me.  I work at Enron as an electricity trader, and I've lived in Houston for about three years.  I've known Richard 9 years from our fraternity days together.  I'm 27 and I graduated from UT 4 1/2 years ago.  Of course, I would be interested in hearing something about you as well. Erin just told me that she had a good friend in Houston that she thought I should meet.  Let me know what you think, and we can go from there.  Clint 
 Wow, I almost forgot.  Thank you.  I will contact her soon. 
 Thanks Amy- Monday Feb 4th  Craig 
 Thank you for the contest, although I am not sure of the amount I've won...I would be happy to receive you payment  Craig 
 Hey Carl,  I hope you got my info out to Oliver.  I'd like to hear from him.  I'm still "working" for Enron.  Actually we are just sitting around according to our shift schedule and answering any calls that might come in cuz' there ain't no more tradin' goin' on...  I got an offer to play baseball in Germany this spring/summer.  I think I'm going to do it.  Ich spreche wenig Deutsch, aber mehr Ubungen huete.  (I speak little German, but I practice today)  I plan on sticking around here until 1) they no longer pay me 2) they ask me to leave or 3) all of the above  Hope all is well, Dean
