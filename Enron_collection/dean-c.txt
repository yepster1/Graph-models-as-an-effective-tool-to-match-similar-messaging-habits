 The "silent one" speaks. 
 Yes, yes.  Sorry for not replying.  I'm good for two. 
 Thank you very much for your help. 
 Amy,  Hi.  This is Richard's, and now Erin's, friend Clint.  I know that she spoke with you about me, and I wanted to see if you might be interested in getting together sometime.  You probably want to know a little about me.  I work at Enron as an electricity trader, and I've lived in Houston for about three years.  I've known Richard 9 years from our fraternity days together.  I'm 27 and I graduated from UT 4 1/2 years ago.  Of course, I would be interested in hearing something about you as well. Erin just told me that she had a good friend in Houston that she thought I should meet.  Let me know what you think, and we can go from there.  Clint 
 Wow, I almost forgot.  Thank you.  I will contact her soon. 
 Thanks Amy- Monday Feb 4th  Craig 
 Thank you for the contest, although I am not sure of the amount I've won...I would be happy to receive you payment  Craig 
 Hey Carl,  I hope you got my info out to Oliver.  I'd like to hear from him.  I'm still "working" for Enron.  Actually we are just sitting around according to our shift schedule and answering any calls that might come in cuz' there ain't no more tradin' goin' on...  I got an offer to play baseball in Germany this spring/summer.  I think I'm going to do it.  Ich spreche wenig Deutsch, aber mehr Ubungen huete.  (I speak little German, but I practice today)  I plan on sticking around here until 1) they no longer pay me 2) they ask me to leave or 3) all of the above  Hope all is well, Deano 
 Cara,  Alicia @ Dynegy ultimately decided to cut this schedule as per my call with her at 16:54 PPT I notified Karen of this cut at 16:55 and Steve @PPM @ 17:21, (because he called me)  Karen maintains that stateline energy is delivered to Grant's Interconnect and not to a valid Mid C delivery point. I gave Alicia BPA (T) and WWP (T) as valid wheels to deliver, but she had already decided to cut and L & D upstream (ulitmately PSCO)   I had a long conversation w/ Matt (Pacificorp) Steve (PPM) and Karen (Chelan) -We talked mainly about the reliability of the energy and the details of the path, but nobody offered a viable solution.  I pointed out the two wheels that could be purchased real time, but this is not there obligation.  Note: Steve (PPM) asked me @ 17:21 if Chelan still wants the energy ( I didn't know and Karen is gone at this time)  Call me with any question, Craig 503.880.5303

 I'll call you after the holidays.  I'd like to know which company and what your doing. I'm staying at Brett's this weekend...even though he is Maryland.  Parents are building a home and moved into a Cracker Jack house for the next few months.  Deano 
 Yeah, I'm alive and still w/Enron...but oh the details...I'll call you soon. Dean  PS.  Never thought Oliver was into that "Party with all your Frat brother's at your wedding" sort of deal. Deano 
 Paco- Hey I thought about our conversation last night and I think we should cover the start and stop times to your season and some other details that might be important.  This is my work e-mail...my home is cdean12@earthlink.net.  I'll write you again from home.  Deano 
 Amy, I am writing in regards to myself, Craig Dean as well as Geir Solberg (out of office) in response to Tim Belden's E-mail on  2/4.
