 Hey,  Tell your mom I'll call her this weekend.  I plan on being at your mom's house the whole day (I don't want to impose..but I'm sure she won't mind)  I don't have to go to the dentist on Friday so I'm free the whole day lets do something.  I'll call you on sat.  go noles,  -Joe 
 That is your call.  I can't read your mind.  I think,  I'm doing the right thing for my son win or lose!  I'm sure you or dad would do the same thing if you were in my shoes.  I have not talked to her at all, so I don't know what her reaction will be.  She seems to like you....  -me 
 What's up?  I will be coming in town the weekend of Nov 1st - Nov 4th.  I hope you don't have plans for that Saturday.  I'll find out today if I can get him for the whole day (12:00 to 7:00) If things workout I would like to take him to Vero for the day.  So I was thinking you could go with me to pick him up and we could spend the day and night in Vero?  Let me know what you think?  My sister will probably also come (just for the day).  As soon as I find out I'll let you know.  Anyway,  how are things down there?  Last weekend I went to Austin for the UT and Colorado game (Austin is an awesome place!!!)  -Joe 
 Are you still at work? 
 Good Morning Jonda,  Please send a reply fax to Miryam and let Tonya now the reason my own son does not know me better is because she won't let him see his own father.  As for the visitation, I hope this will soon end with her making all of the decisions but in the mean time I will talk to my family to see what is best.  I know if I choose to see him on Sunday, I would need to see him in the morning from 9 to 12:00. My flight is @ 5:30 and I'm 3 hours away from the airport.  I will let you know sometime this afternoon or first thing in the morning.  Thank you, -Joe
