 Hi Rhonda,  I know you are not the one who is working on this but I forgot who was....Can you tell me who and forward this email to that person.  I'm a little concerned about my State Income Tax deduction.  I have not yet seen any withdraws from my check and I know State of Oregon will charge you penalties if you exceed a certain amount per quarter.  Please look into this as soon as you can.  Thank You.  lisa 
 I think its on or about page 84.  lisa 
 Hi Sabrina, I'm working on the suject DMS.  I'm going to need detailed settlement data from the counterparty.  Thanks,  Lisa 
 I NEED YOU FOR A MOMENT..  LISA 
 HELLO??????  LISA 
 for you info  lisa 
 For your info.  lisa 
 Thanks.  Just to clarify, I am needing Enron's deal number.  lisa 
 Thanks!  lisa 
 Virgina, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe BPA has special rules when energy is curtailed.  Instead of us charging them with liquidated damages, BPA will not bill for the hours curtailed.  I track and record the cuts by modifying the deal in deal scheduling so that settlement is aware of the cuts.  lisa 
 Scheduling will resume as normal on Friday July 5th for SW and NW.  I will come in and schedule.  For California, we can schedule in advance on the 3rd for July 4th-8th.  I will be here to cover for California on Friday in case of problems.  Lisa 
 a little hung over....hey did you ask your sister?????????????????????????? 
 Both for all of Dec and or any day that has discrepancy. Thanks!  lisa

 $2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.  Lisa 
  I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps.   Lisa
