 Attached is the interconnect data sheet for Athens.  You and Raimund may want to update it for site specific criteria that has been identified since they changed the power plant site point. 
 I still need to get with you.  I will be out Monday afternoon, but could meet any other afternoon next week.  The job change has been invigorating and very enjoyable.  I really appreciate this opportunity.  Let me know when you are available.

 I need access to CPR Reports/CPR Print Manager and my own I.D. for CQG. 
 No economics or overview/summary, but I would talk to Brad McKay about the basis.  In the past we have valued Leidy at CNG North in the summer and Tetco M3/Transco NNY Z6 in the winter, but Brad has probably refined this by now.  Gas Daily has suggested that they will come out with an index for the point starting this November.  However, they still don't know what liquidity the point will bring.

 According to Dick's notes from the deal ticket, we recalled the gas on 12/7/00, 12/28-31/00, 3/8/01, 3/22/01 and 3/24-26/01.  In talking with Cindy, it appears that at least two tickets were put into Sitara.  One ticket was our sale to Colonial and another ticket has us buying back from Colonial.  Sitara # 658124 is the ticket covering the buyback for March 2001.  Looking at the ticket in Sitara, there is an inconsistency between the Sitara volumes and the Unify bridged volumes.  Cindy, have you had a chance to check into this?

 Rickey,  The best I can show you right now is Index plus $0.015 for 5000 Dth/d for Tetco WLA.  Let me know if this would work for you.  John
