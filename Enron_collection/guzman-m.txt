 Amy, I would like to attend this course.  Thank you! 
 You betcha,  I get off around 5:30-5:45 where were you thinking. 
 Yeah tell me about it.  So the reason I called to see if you wanted to do something last week was because I got a settlement on my some of my dads insurance shit and I wanted to go out to a nice dinner.  I thought it would be a nice opportunity for us to hang out and catch up.  I hope you don't still think that I didn't want to see you that night because you are dating dave, I just had to run some errands right when you called back. 
 Never mind.  So anyway, I am totally worked right now.  I went to the Blazer game with my friend Kate and we ended up going out afterward.  i ended up staying out until 2am and I had to be in to work at 5:30.  So basically my day is totally sucking.  How are you doing? 
 ya don't say? 
 Dave, if you are short cash I can send you the check tommorow, however, I will be down there next Wednesday so I can just give you a check when i get down there if you like. 
 Dave, call you this weekend.  Thanks for breaking it down for me. 
 Okay, I am officially a dumb ass! Next time I email you I will be sure to check my spelling and GRAMMAR 
 Yeah you like that?  Aren't you just little miss grammer today! 
 Hey a few of us are going to grab some drinks after work wanna come? 
 Jesse told me to email you this.  It is the Cal ISO private web site https://iso_si/iso/ 
 So are you not talking to me anymore or something?  I emailed once and called twice in the past week and a half  and haven't heard back from you? 
 You love it when I pick on you. 
 Bill I have a freind that just graduated from Oregon State with a business degree i think his emphasis was MIS and finance.  He is a pretty bright kid and wants to pursue a carrer in finance.   I actually talked to him about it at some length about Enron on New Years Day and he seemed very interested. .  He is a friend of mine from my fraternity and a really good guy who I think would fit in well here if given the opportunity.  I dont know about your feelings on hiring guys right out of college.  I know we had done so in the past but I wasn't really sure about your feelings on that.  Let me know. 
 Dave, I am planning on driving up after I get off work on Saturday morning and should be up in Seattle by about 10:30 or so.  I will probably just go to Jorge's and crash out until you arrive.  Have you guys made any plans for Saturday night?  I talked to Donald, he wasn't aware that you were even coming but he said he would like to do something with all of us.  We actually talked about maybe going skiing on sunday I don't know if you would be intereseted in doing  that. 
 Ryan, I had already purchased tickets to go to LA and then Las Vegas for that 6 day break i have at the end of the month, so I won't be able to work the night of the 26th 
 Bill, for approximately 2 and a half hours on (2:20-5:00am MST)  the scrape was completely down.  There was no access to it at all.  To maintain the model and also to properly run the units i maintained 15 minute verbal contacts with Generation, and updated the scrape based on the numbers that they gave me.  The numbers appeared good and there were no problems for those hours.  Apparently this also happened to Holden earlier on 12/23.  I also had one hour on 12/23 (HE 24) that was not working correctly either.  Thought I should let you know.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
 Les, on 12/24 I input the Willamette transaction as usual however I could not get the deal number 471943 (transmission piece we have been using) to extend to this day.  Therefore in order to keep us flat I just created one transmission deal for 15MW HE 1-24 and used the normal pac transmission price.  I am not sure if this is correct or how this should eactly be handled.  I will be on break from the 24th thru the 30 so if you could fix the deal if that is not the correct way to do it, that would be greatly appreciated.  Also if you could let me know what was done for future reference.  Thanks,  Merry x-mas and Happy New Year! 
 Tim, I understand and will comply with these requests. 
 Bill, during HE 17  IID had a 130 MW  Firm in the scrape and in the model. When checking out with IID they stated they had 120 MW only.  In speaking with Joe at  IID they stated that  they spoke with Tony at 14:13 PST and told him to put in 120 for HE 17 and 18 MST.  I agreed to check out with their number as it appears that there was a miscommunication between IID, Tony, and David (who was working during that shift).  You may want to ask Tony when he comes in if he recalls this conversation.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
 Bill, per our conversation last night I phoned PAC to see if they could put in the disputed Idaho deal.  They stated that they could not do that.  They were very nice about it an stated that they have problems with Idaho quite often but they had to turn away several customers during that hour and would not be able to add our schedule.  I have deleted the deals from enpower and I have deleted them from the El Paso sheet however, I did not do a final checkout with Idaho Power for those hours in case we have any further recourse on this issue.  Thank you for your help in this matter and please let me know what you need me to do to further resolve this issue. 
 What the hell? 
 Hey sharkey.  I will be out of town the 23rd thru the 30th.  How long are you going to be in town for? 
 Thats a dilema. 
 Thank you for your prompt response! 
 I am sorry.  I have been sooooo busy this week with work and tonight I am going to the lakers game with my friend from work, however, I would love to hang out with ya this weekend sometime.  Call me tommorow durring the day at home or on my cell! 
 Oh yeah and I might bring Price Strader too. 
 Is it allright if I bring Marc Johnson? 
 Hardy Har Har......   I meant on the game itself not you drinking or not drinking?   By the way why are you not drinking at the game 
 So whats the bet for the game on Wednesday? 
 I am not to picky.  I dated you didn't I? 
 Amy and John, several people within the Real Time Group are curious as to the process regarding our new holiday bonus pay.  We are all extremely grateful to have this new compensation package but some clarification would be great.    I would assume that we would be paid for working a holiday on the following pay period.  For example I worked on the Friday after Thanksgiving ( Considered a minor holiday $250).  Would it be correct to assume that I would be paid for that holiday on December 15th?  Would this bonus pay be included in our regular paycheck or come seperate like an expense check? Is there anything we need to do?  It seems that several people within the group are unclear on this new policy other than the amount of the pay.   Could you please clarify this process for us?    Thank you for your attention to this matter and Happy Holidays! 
 Dude.  I will be having some beers with our friend Marc Johnson on Friday night.   I will be down in SF today thru Sunday and he is going to be there to.  Also when i talked to him today he said he is planning on coming up the weekend of the 15th so I will keep you posted.  See ya 
 Dude I hear you are going to be in town this weekend.  Unfortunately I will be gone, I am going to SF to hang with Burnsy as i have a six day break from work.  I will however, be back in town on Sunday night.  If you are going to be in town  still maybe we could grab a beer late sunday night (I don't get in until 10) or grab lunch on Monday as I don't work monday.  Give me a call on my cell and let me know.  Oh, by the way i will be going out with the one and only Marc Johnson for some beers in the city on Friday night.  He is in the country for a month.  If you want to have a chat with the man give us a call that night 503-702-0463.  Take care buddy and happy holidays!  Oh yeah, what is your address. I am sending out some x-mas cards. 
 Dude I have to work New Years Day.  I was sure we were going to get ganked and end up in the Holiday Bowl.  I would have definetly been able to go to that.   I am fucking pissed.  Anyway, I might still go to the Holiday Bowl and root for Texas. 
 okay so it's 2:30 am and I am so ready to be out of here it is ridiculous.  I am so excited to come down there and have some fun and just forget about work and all the other lame ass shit that has been going on in my life.  Anyway looking forward to seeing you and here is Burnsy's cell phone number 415-710-3410.   Also remember if you don't want to drive home that night or take the Bart home (you taking the bart home alone scares me) you are more than welcome to crash at Burnsys house on Thursday night.  He has a pull out bed and told me to tell you you are more than welcome to crash there.  I will catch up with ya tommorow and we will figure out what to do Thursday night. 
 John.  SW Market was $175 @ $225 during these hours.  I put these deals in @ $200. 
 I will be in San Fransisco until Monday, So if you could just hang on to it when it comes it would be greatly appreciated.  thank you very much for your follow up. 
 Hey sweetie.  I am flying in early in the morning on Wednesday and will be at Burnsys house most of the day.  I will give you a call later this evening however, the better day for us to hang out will most be on Thursday night as Burnsy and i had planned on going to the warrior vs lakers hoops game on Wednesday night.  Anyway I will give ya a call.  Take care sweetie and see ya soon. 
 okay this should fix it. 
 Yeah I guess that makes sense.  I thought you were madly in love with this cat. 
 Here is your stuff whinner 
 Kathy, I believe this model is now fixed.  Let me know if there are any other troubles 
 sounds good.  give me a call on Sunday and let me know or i will try and get a hold of you 
 All right you are done on both of those games and I want delivery of the funny story today before you forget.  Unless it is about me and then I just don't even want to know. 
 Okay so here is the email I sent earlier.  Hey so do you have any good stories about stuff you did that night or what?  I do 
 My address is 1515 NW 28th Apt7 Portland OR 97210 
 Yeah I don't remember automatic winning rights either.  Neither do I remember automatic "whining"  rights. 
 You lost a bet.  You owe me the dinner its not like you called me up and asked me out.  And besides if I wouldn't have kept asking you about it I am sure you would have "forgot" 
 So lets see.  You want me to take time out of my busy schedule so that you can plan a date with some dude? 
 No. 
 So how are you and what his face doing? 
 Dude, I am totally joking around with you.  You always look cute.  Well at least when you were dating me you always looked cute. 
 Well you know I got a rep to uphold and i don't want to be out on the town with someone looking all scrappy! 
 Are you gonna wear something cute tonight? 
 Okay so, five hours at work and so far no fallout from christmas party shenanigans!  This is going better that expected. 
 Hey how late will he be here on sunday.  I think I get in town at 5 
 Yeah, I locked myself out of my house also.  really smart move!  I felt so terrible yesterday after our two nights of binge drinking.  I can't believe you stayed up partying until 6 in the morning.  You are CRAZY.  Hey did we make some sort of deal on those tickets.  I vaguely remember something to that effect. 
 So what time did you end up getting home on Saturday night.  I was absolutely demolished on Sunday and left the house only to come down and pick up my car which was at the Embassy Suites?  Did ya have fun? 
 Sorry won't be there as I am going down to San Fran to have a few brews with Burns for the weekend. 
 Kim, who do you think you are fooling?  A drink or two?  Really?!?!  I think I have heard that one from you before.  I don't even say shit like that anymore because when I say shit like that I end up partying harder than I would have had I just kept my mouth shut.  But in respect for your new job we will make sure you are home and tucked in bed early!  :)  See ya soon! 
 Where is the Holiday ale fest?  Is it cool? Are you on some sort of secret beer newsletter that I am not getting?  How come I only hear about this shit from you?  I feel out of touch with the world of brewdom 
 Dude that is psycho!  But i will still give her a break because she was cute. 
 Wow!   Someone has lost there sense of humor!  Maybe you are having an estrogen overdose. 
 YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I knew that would get you all worked up! 
 I don't believe for a second that you didn't make plans with Dave!  Monday will probably be okay.  I would say lets plan on it but I know how bad you are about shit like that so just call me Sunday and let me know.  If I don't hear from you by then I will just assume we aren't going.  have a great day 
 I could probably do monday night.  I will have to get back to you.  What happened to Friday? 
 when am i getting my victory dinner.   I figure I ought to hit you up now before you get bac together with dave 
 Yo baby whats up?  Thanks for hanging out with me on Monday night.  I had a really good time (even if you were preoccupied with the Dave thing).  I hope all is going well for you.  I am actually working a day shift which is pretty cool because there is a lot less to do on the day shifts.  So, what do you have going for the rest of the week?  I have a work function tonight.  One of my friends is moving to the Calgary office so we are all going for beers at the Lucky Lab in southeast.    I got a call from my date from hell. Aparently I told her last week that we could grab a movie tonight.  I don't want to go so I think I am just going to tell her that this work thing is going to last too late.  Anyway how is your grandmother doing?   Are you excited about your party this weekend?  I went and bought a couple dress shirts and a tie for my christmas party at Nordstrom yesterday and ended up spending $184 !  Just on two shirts and a tie.  I should just refrain from even going to that store.  Check ya later sweetie! 
 Whats up lil' Kirky.  Don't worry about getting cut off I figured your phone just died or something.  I am so excited to come down there and hang out in the city.  I haven't hung out in the City since turning 21 and would love to go check things out.  That would be awesome if you could come into town on Wednesday or Thursday night.  Maybe we could grab dinner and some drinks.  I called your brother last night and left a message telling him that I was going to be in town.  Hopefully he isn't mad at me for all the assing out I did the weekend of Wilsons wedding.  I think my body is still recovering from all those shenanigans.  Anyway I will give you a call or email you early next week and let you know what our plan is for Wednesday and Thursday.  Look forward to seeing ya sweetie. Take Care! 
 Guys.  I started to work on this and contacted Forney today however due to computer problems I did not finish this today.
