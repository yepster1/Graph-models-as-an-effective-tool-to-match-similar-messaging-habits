 Amy, I would like to attend this course.  Thank you! 
 You betcha,  I get off around 5:30-5:45 where were you thinking. 
 Yeah tell me about it.  So the reason I called to see if you wanted to do something last week was because I got a settlement on my some of my dads insurance shit and I wanted to go out to a nice dinner.  I thought it would be a nice opportunity for us to hang out and catch up.  I hope you don't still think that I didn't want to see you that night because you are dating dave, I just had to run some errands right when you called back. 
 Never mind.  So anyway, I am totally worked right now.  I went to the Blazer game with my friend Kate and we ended up going out afterward.  i ended up staying out until 2am and I had to be in to work at 5:30.  So basically my day is totally sucking.  How are you doing? 
 ya don't say? 
 Dave, if you are short cash I can send you the check tommorow, however, I will be down there next Wednesday so I can just give you a check when i get down there if you like. 
 Dave, call you this weekend.  Thanks for breaking it down for me. 
 Okay, I am officially a dumb ass! Next time I email you I will be sure to check my spelling and GRAMMAR 
 Yeah you like that?  Aren't you just little miss grammer today! 
 Hey a few of us are going to grab some drinks after work wanna come? 
 Jesse told me to email you this.  It is the Cal ISO private web site https://iso_si/iso/ 
 So are you not talking to me anymore or something?  I emailed once and called twice in the past week and a half  and haven't heard back from you? 
 You love it when I pick on you. 
 Bill I have a freind that just graduated from Oregon State with a business degree i think his emphasis was MIS and finance.  He is a pretty bright kid and wants to pursue a carrer in finance.   I actually talked to him about it at some length about Enron on New Years Day and he seemed very interested. .  He is a friend of mine from my fraternity and a really good guy who I think would fit in well here if given the opportunity.  I dont know about your feelings on hiring guys right out of college.  I know we had done so in the past but I wasn't really sure about your feelings on that.  Let me know. 
 Dave, I am planning on driving up after I get off work on Saturday morning and should be up in Seattle by about 10:30 or so.  I will probably just go to Jorge's and crash out until you arrive.  Have you guys made any plans for Saturday night?  I talked to Donald, he wasn't aware that you were even coming but he said he would like to do something with all of us.  We actually talked about maybe going skiing on sunday I don't know if you would be intereseted in doing  that. 
 Ryan, I had already purchased tickets to go to LA and then Las Vegas for that 6 day break i have at the end of the month, so I won't be able to work the night of the 26th 
 Bill, for approximately 2 and a half hours on (2:20-5:00am MST)  the scrape was completely down.  There was no access to it at all.  To maintain the model and also to properly run the units i maintained 15 minute verbal contacts with Generation, and updated the scrape based on the numbers that they gave me.  The numbers appeared good and there were no problems for those hours.  Apparently this also happened to Holden earlier on 12/23.  I also had one hour on 12/23 (HE 24) that was not working correctly either.  Thought I should let you know.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
 Les, on 12/24 I input the Willamette transaction as usual however I could not get the deal number 471943 (transmission piece we have been using) to extend to this day.  Therefore in order to keep us flat I just created one transmission deal for 15MW HE 1-24 and used the normal pac transmission price.  I am not sure if this is correct or how this should eactly be handled.  I will be on break from the 24th thru the 30 so if you could fix the deal if that is not the correct way to do it, that would be greatly appreciated.  Also if you could let me know what was done for future reference.  Thanks,  Merry x-mas and Happy New Year! 
 Tim, I understand and will comply with these requests. 
 Bill, during HE 17  IID had a 130 MW  Firm in the scrape and in the model. When checking out with IID they stated they had 120 MW only.  In speaking with Joe at  IID they stated that  they spoke with Tony at 14:13 PST and told him to put in 120 for HE 17 and 18 MST.  I agreed to check out with their number as it appears that there was a miscommunication between IID, Tony, and David (who was working during that shift).  You may want to ask Tony when he comes in if he recalls this conversation.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
 Bill, per our conversation last night I phoned PAC to see if they could put in the disputed Idaho deal.  They stated that they could not do that.  They were very nice about it an stated that they have problems with Idaho quite often but they had to turn away several customers during that hour and would not be able to add our schedule.  I have deleted the deals from enpower and I have deleted them from the El Paso sheet however, I did not do a final checkout with Idaho Power for those hours in case we have any further recourse on this issue.  Thank you for your help in this matter and please let me know what you need me to do to further resolve this issue. 
 What the hell? 
 Hey sharkey.  I will be out of town the 23rd thru the 30th.  How long are you going to be in town for? 
 Thats a dilema. 
 Thank you for your prompt response! 
 I am sorry.  I have been sooooo busy this week with work and tonight I am going to the lakers game with my friend from work, however, I would love to hang out with ya this weekend sometime.  Call me tommorow durring the day at home or on my cell! 
 Oh yeah and I might bring Price Strader too. 
 Is it allright if I bring Marc Johnson? 
 Hardy Har Har......   I meant on the game itself not you drinking or not drinking?   By the way why are you not drinking at the game 
 So whats the bet for the game on Wednesday? 
 I am not to picky.  I dated you didn't I? 
 Amy and John, several people within the Real Time Group are curious as to the process regarding our new holiday bonus pay.  We are all extremely grateful to have this new compensation package but some clarification would be great.    I would assume that we would be paid for working a holiday on the following pay period.  For example I worked on the Friday after Thanksgiving ( Considered a minor holiday $250).  Would it be correct to assume that I would be paid for that holiday on December 15th?  Would this bonus pay be included in our regular paycheck or come seperate like an expense check? Is there anything we need to do?  It seems that several people within the group are unclear on this new policy other than the amount of the pay.   Could you please clarify this process for us?    Thank you for your attention to this matter and Happy Holidays! 
 Dude.  I will be having some beers with our friend Marc Johnson on Friday night.   I will be down in SF today thru Sunday and he is going to be there to.  Also when i talked to him today he said he is planning on coming up the weekend of the 15th so I will keep you posted.  See ya 
 Dude I hear you are going to be in town this weekend.  Unfortunately I will be gone, I am going to SF to hang with Burnsy as i have a six day break from work.  I will however, be back in town on Sunday night.  If you are going to be in town  still maybe we could grab a beer late sunday night (I don't get in until 10) or grab lunch on Monday as I don't work monday.  Give me a call on my cell and let me know.  Oh, by the way i will be going out with the one and only Marc Johnson for some beers in the city on Friday night.  He is in the country for a month.  If you want to have a chat with the man give us a call that night 503-702-0463.  Take care buddy and happy holidays!  Oh yeah, what is your address. I am sending out some x-mas cards. 
 Dude I have to work New Years Day.  I was sure we were going to get ganked and end up in the Holiday Bowl.  I would have definetly been able to go to that.   I am fucking pissed.  Anyway, I might still go to the Holiday Bowl and root for Texas. 
 okay so it's 2:30 am and I am so ready to be out of here it is ridiculous.  I am so excited to come down there and have some fun and just forget about work and all the other lame ass shit that has been going on in my life.  Anyway looking forward to seeing you and here is Burnsy's cell phone number 415-710-3410.   Also remember if you don't want to drive home that night or take the Bart home (you taking the bart home alone scares me) you are more than welcome to crash at Burnsys house on Thursday night.  He has a pull out bed and told me to tell you you are more than welcome to crash there.  I will catch up with ya tommorow and we will figure out what to do Thursday night. 
 John.  SW Market was $175 @ $225 during these hours.  I put these deals in @ $200. 
 I will be in San Fransisco until Monday, So if you could just hang on to it when it comes it would be greatly appreciated.  thank you very much for your follow up. 
 Hey sweetie.  I am flying in early in the morning on Wednesday and will be at Burnsys house most of the day.  I will give you a call later this evening however, the better day for us to hang out will most be on Thursday night as Burnsy and i had planned on going to the warrior vs lakers hoops game on Wednesday night.  Anyway I will give ya a call.  Take care sweetie and see ya soon. 
 okay this should fix it. 
 Yeah I guess that makes sense.  I thought you were madly in love with this cat. 
 Here is your stuff whinner 
 Kathy, I believe this model is now fixed.  Let me know if there are any other troubles 
 sounds good.  give me a call on Sunday and let me know or i will try and get a hold of you 
 All right you are done on both of those games and I want delivery of the funny story today before you forget.  Unless it is about me and then I just don't even want to know. 
 Okay so here is the email I sent earlier.  Hey so do you have any good stories about stuff you did that night or what?  I do 
 My address is 1515 NW 28th Apt7 Portland OR 97210 
 Yeah I don't remember automatic winning rights either.  Neither do I remember automatic "whining"  rights. 
 You lost a bet.  You owe me the dinner its not like you called me up and asked me out.  And besides if I wouldn't have kept asking you about it I am sure you would have "forgot" 
 So lets see.  You want me to take time out of my busy schedule so that you can plan a date with some dude? 
 No. 
 So how are you and what his face doing? 
 Dude, I am totally joking around with you.  You always look cute.  Well at least when you were dating me you always looked cute. 
 Well you know I got a rep to uphold and i don't want to be out on the town with someone looking all scrappy! 
 Are you gonna wear something cute tonight? 
 Okay so, five hours at work and so far no fallout from christmas party shenanigans!  This is going better that expected. 
 Hey how late will he be here on sunday.  I think I get in town at 5 
 Yeah, I locked myself out of my house also.  really smart move!  I felt so terrible yesterday after our two nights of binge drinking.  I can't believe you stayed up partying until 6 in the morning.  You are CRAZY.  Hey did we make some sort of deal on those tickets.  I vaguely remember something to that effect. 
 So what time did you end up getting home on Saturday night.  I was absolutely demolished on Sunday and left the house only to come down and pick up my car which was at the Embassy Suites?  Did ya have fun? 
 Sorry won't be there as I am going down to San Fran to have a few brews with Burns for the weekend. 
 Kim, who do you think you are fooling?  A drink or two?  Really?!?!  I think I have heard that one from you before.  I don't even say shit like that anymore because when I say shit like that I end up partying harder than I would have had I just kept my mouth shut.  But in respect for your new job we will make sure you are home and tucked in bed early!  :)  See ya soon! 
 Where is the Holiday ale fest?  Is it cool? Are you on some sort of secret beer newsletter that I am not getting?  How come I only hear about this shit from you?  I feel out of touch with the world of brewdom 
 Dude that is psycho!  But i will still give her a break because she was cute. 
 Wow!   Someone has lost there sense of humor!  Maybe you are having an estrogen overdose. 
 YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I knew that would get you all worked up! 
 I don't believe for a second that you didn't make plans with Dave!  Monday will probably be okay.  I would say lets plan on it but I know how bad you are about shit like that so just call me Sunday and let me know.  If I don't hear from you by then I will just assume we aren't going.  have a great day 
 I could probably do monday night.  I will have to get back to you.  What happened to Friday? 
 when am i getting my victory dinner.   I figure I ought to hit you up now before you get bac together with dave 
 Yo baby whats up?  Thanks for hanging out with me on Monday night.  I had a really good time (even if you were preoccupied with the Dave thing).  I hope all is going well for you.  I am actually working a day shift which is pretty cool because there is a lot less to do on the day shifts.  So, what do you have going for the rest of the week?  I have a work function tonight.  One of my friends is moving to the Calgary office so we are all going for beers at the Lucky Lab in southeast.    I got a call from my date from hell. Aparently I told her last week that we could grab a movie tonight.  I don't want to go so I think I am just going to tell her that this work thing is going to last too late.  Anyway how is your grandmother doing?   Are you excited about your party this weekend?  I went and bought a couple dress shirts and a tie for my christmas party at Nordstrom yesterday and ended up spending $184 !  Just on two shirts and a tie.  I should just refrain from even going to that store.  Check ya later sweetie! 
 Whats up lil' Kirky.  Don't worry about getting cut off I figured your phone just died or something.  I am so excited to come down there and hang out in the city.  I haven't hung out in the City since turning 21 and would love to go check things out.  That would be awesome if you could come into town on Wednesday or Thursday night.  Maybe we could grab dinner and some drinks.  I called your brother last night and left a message telling him that I was going to be in town.  Hopefully he isn't mad at me for all the assing out I did the weekend of Wilsons wedding.  I think my body is still recovering from all those shenanigans.  Anyway I will give you a call or email you early next week and let you know what our plan is for Wednesday and Thursday.  Look forward to seeing ya sweetie. Take Care! 
 Guys.  I started to work on this and contacted Forney today however due to computer problems I did not finish this today. Could one of you please take care of this matter tonight.  thank you for your assistance. 
 Les, we were unable to find power at a reasonable rate for the  HE 5 2MW schedule so we therefore we just didn't show up in the PX for that hour.  The only offer we recieved was for $225 which I felt was too steep to pay.  It turned out well however as the PX price was $120 and there was no cong at Mead so we saved them a little money by not buying the $225.  Just thought I would let you know. 
 Hey Tyson.  Are you guys doing anything after the game?  I think Ben Pacewic, Jeff Burns, Kevin Stangeland, Chris Hartman, Rueben Schug and some other guys are coming down and staying the night but i don't think we will have time to stop by before the game.  I know I would like to come by the house and see how things are doing and I am sure those guys would to so let me know if you guys have anything going on Saturday night.  YITB  GUZ 
 So I went out with a bunch of dudes from work last night.  Me and my buddy Bill met these two chicks at the Saucebox and one of them asked for my number.  So I pick up my cell phone this morning and theres a message.  The chick called me last night!  The night I freaking met her.  HELLO PSYCHO! 
 Whats up Lester.  Are you going to go to the Bowl game.  It looks right now like it might be the fiesta or the Holliday Bowl.  If it is the Holliday Bowl i will probably go however if it is the Fiesta bowl I wont be able to make it.  How is the family.  Are you guys planning on coming out anytime soon 
 Dont worry about it.  I had a good time.  I don't really know what our plan is for the Beaver Game as I am hanging out with Burns and some guys from my fraternity and hadn't really planned on hanging out with those guys until after the game.  But you can give me a call on my cell phone that day and I can let you know where the Winnebago is and maybe you guys can come meet us or if not we can meet up after the game or something. 
 So do I get a raincheck on Beaches? 
 I will be in LA folio.  Sorry 
 Thanks for being so nice about me venting.  I actually tried to call you but you were porbably in bed.  So I just went to the store grabbed as six pack had a few beers and sat at my computer for until about 3 am.  I was really having an enmotional night last night.  I think I just hadn't let go of my feelings and it all just came out in one night.  It is funny but the next morning I got calls from both Price Strader and Kim Kirkwood to see how I was doing.  Did I ever tell you the story about Kim and I at Wilsons wedding?    If not I should tell you it is really funny.  Anyway as far as watching the game I would love to watch it with you but I have tickets. Benny,  Burns, and a bunch of us are taking Benny's Winnebago down there and partying.  What sucks though is I have a night shift so basically I will be going down there on no sleep.  Regarding Beaches, I would love to do that also but, I am leaving on Sunday for LA and won't be back until the day after thanksgiving.  So, i guess i will just give you a call or something when I get back.  I thought that you would be watching the game with Dave.  Did something happen and you guys get in a fight again or something? 
 That was the absolutely one of the stupidest jokes I have ever heard.  Maybe you guys should put down your bongs for a minute and try to come up with something a little better than that.  GO BEAVS! 
 Wait do we pay her or just charge it online? 
 I would definetly be interested.  Tell her I will have the money for her on Sunday 
 Harbor Cogen called this on Monday night shift at approximately HE 24 stating that they would be unable to supply their day ahead schedules due to a crack in an oil supply line.  Mike at Harbor stated that we should not bid in day ahead schedules for Wednesday either as it appears to be a problem which may take some time to fix.  To cover the day ahead schedules we looked for power to cover it in SP however we could not find even an offer during the night shift.  I would advise Les and whomever is on the day and night shifts on Tuesday to keep in touch with Harbor regarding this issue.  Thank you for your attention to this matter and if you should have any questions please call me on my cell 702-0463 
 Hey dave.  I have a night shift tonight so thats why I am not getting back to  you until now.   Regarding Thanksgiving I have the 18th through the 23rd off. It is one of those six day breaks i was telling you about.  So this saturday (18th) I am going to the Civil War (Uof O vs. OSU) footbal game.  I am way fired up about it.  It should be a great time.  Then on Sunday afternoon I will be flying in to Orange County at 3:30pm and will be down there through Thursday evening when I will be flying back home at 6:30. Unfortunately I have to work the Friday after thanksgiving but at least I will be able to spend thanksgiving day  and most of the week with all of you.  I am going to be staying at my mothers house for the week.  Maybe Sunday evening we can all have dinner together or something after i get in. Anyway looking forward to seeing all of you.  I should be able to come down again for Christmas as I have the 24th through the 29th off.  Hey, have fun at the game and keep an eye on the scoreboard and root for the beavs!  If we win and Washington loses we go to the Rose Bowl  Take Care and see you this weekend! 
 So what is this "living in a hotel" shit? 
 Group,  Yesterday 11 /11 and this morning  11/12  the ISO cut one of our schedules where Enron was exporting from SP 15, to NOb more specifically the schedule looks like this: CISO-EPMI-SCL. Per Sean Crandall starting tomorrow and forward we will not allow the ISO to cut our schedules UNTIL  all the OTHER nonfirm schedules are cut FIRST. This is made possible by new FTRs that Chris Mallory scheduled on the Sp/NOB path.  As a result of having firm transmission rights If the ISO calls and cuts one of our schedules at NOB we need to make sure  and ask the ISO that the other nonfirm  schedules are cut first then we can accept our cut.  For any further questions on this matter contact Sean Crandall or Chris MAllory  thanks Monika 
 Yeah I like to hassle Eric and  I really kind of miss it actually.  My cell phone number is 503-702-0463 and my home number is 503-228-7767.  I would love to grab a beer with ya sometime.  Are you going to the Civil War Game next weekend? 
 Yep I am here.  How are you doing? 
 When did you get all responsible and shit?  Sign me up for $25 
 I don't know.  Its funny because we do the same thing with John Brown 
 On November 8th begining at HE 8 Tosco informed Real time that they were going off the grid with no return ETA.   They were scheduled in correctly for the day ahead at 7 MW.  We were able to take out hours 11-24 however, hours 8-10 we were short ex-post by the 7 MW.  Toscos schedule was zeroed out by decing short term cali load in PGE 3 per Jeff Richter.  Note to real time night shift.  Tosco may be coming back on line completely but as of yet they have not  called back to notify when that may be.  Please contact me or Jeremy with any questions. 
 As Jay Brown says "shit I don't even have any money to eat" 
 sounds good to me. 
 Yo, are we doin lunch tommorow still? 
 If we would have sent that Beaver Morris's home loan email that beaver could have had a roof over his head and this never would have happened. 
 I actually thought you were being serious so thats why I didn't respond. That and I am super busy right now.  Anyway talk to you later 
 I switch back and forth from night to day shifts it depends on the week.  I have been working day shifts this week.  I would say I would like to watch the game but I am actually going to the game.  What about a beer later in the week or this weekend.  I think Johnson might be in town soon, I reecieved an email from him this week. 
 Sounds to me like this guy is full of shit!.   As seems to be typical for most of those retards that used to work for Wilshire. 
 So, i have a question.  If Danny has been constantly asking you to come work for him how come he is now trying to get you a job somewhere else?  I thought he wanted you to work for him? 
 I think Bruce Zechenelly used to work for Advanta.  If you get an interview their I can call him and ask him how they are as a company. 
 The fact that you are moving down there has nothing to do with whether or not I do.  I was just joking.  Stop be so over analytical.  :)   Did you talk to Danny about the offer? 
 I don't know for sure if I am.  I am just in the "seriously thinking about it" stages.  However the fact that you are moving down there is definetly making me lean toward staying up here.  Tell your mom if you move and I stay she can adopt me. 
 Your mom rocks! 
 Dude, do you have Cheryl's phone number? 
 My reccomendations would be either Silver Dollar or Sports Page. 
 Loverboy.  Power Band of the 80's! 
 Bill, I would really like to sign up for the derivatives course being offered on June 4th and 5th.  I had already requested the 1st thru the 5th off in order to attend a wedding in LA however, I would like to attend the course and if selected would cut my trip short.  Let me know.  Thank you. 
 I thought of a great comeback for that one but since I haven't heard from you in a while I am going to be nice 
 You Wanna Piece of My Heart.... You better start from the start 
 How about if we just scrap the position all together and let Al Gore sell the White House to the Chinese at a Budhist Campaign Fundraiser  for the Democratic Party.  And then let the entire country be governed by referendum.  Oh wait, lets see there are 50 referendums on my ballot anyway so maybe we don't need state congress either. 
 Thanks sweetheart.  I am hanging in there as good as can be expected.  I was down there for two weeks and spent nearly all day every day with my sister and getting her moved to my moms and taking care of the funeral and all his bills and stuff.  It was a very hard two weeks but, I am doing okay.  I am more worried about my sister than anything else though.  She has my mom and stepdad though.  I felt bad leaving but my work had been so cool to give me two weeks of paid that I figured I shouldn't push it.  Anyway, I would love to go grab a beer with you sometime in the near future.  It is kind of nice just to go out and forget about things once in a while.  So how is everything with you?  You and Billy good?   Hows your family?  Let me know sometime if you want to grab a beer or lunch or coffee or something. 
 Hey there.  I am back and at work today.  Thank you for the phone calls and sorry I didnt return them but I was just entirely to busy and recieved too many calls to return them all until I came home.  I hope everything is going well for you.  We will have to get together and grab a bite to eat or a beer or something this week.  How was your weekend? 
 I assume when you say sick you were refering to Angelas friend.  If so, then no I didn't even touch her.  Angela actuall hates Nicole she says she is a "fat ho".  I have a very good story to tell you about what happened. 
 No come to find out Angelas little friend had herpes!  YUCK!  But actually you know her.  It is Nicole.  The girl that Jay was dating for a while.  Jay didn't care but it caused a huge fight between Angela and I.  It was pretty messy. 
 I feel bad but she understands.  I think she might come up and be with me for thanksgiving.  I have a six day break right around then and I think it would be good for her to just get away for a while. Guess what?  I had a couple of dates while I was in LA.  They went very well and she might come up in December for a weekend! 
 Letting him stir is good in some ways but guys actually tend to like a lack of clarity in relationships as it gives them more leeway.  However, I don't really know the dynamic in your relationship at all.  So Angela and I made up from our huge saturday morning fight before I left on Sunday and she cried like a baby when i left.  I feel so bad leaving her. She is really broken hearted right now. 
 How come you wanted a date for halloween then? 
 I just looked at myu schedule and I have to work neew years eve during the day and I don't know yet about new years day.. It really isn't that big of a deal to me.  The important thing for me right now is spending my free time to go down and spend time with my sister so I could kind of care less about going to the Beavers Bowl game when I can just watch it on TV. I mean it would be nice to go but it is not the slightest bit a priority for me right now.  So are you and dave seeing each other exclusively or are you dating other people? 
 Did I tell you I saw Kathy Chaney at Cobalt Lounge about 3 weeks ago, and then the next day i was that Prisilla (sp?) at Scooters?  I just thought it was wierd seeing two of your friends on two succesive evenings. 
 I just wasnt sure what we were doing thats all.  Yes if the Beavs go I will go if i have the day off but it is not likely they will.  We have to beat the ducks which is reasonable but UW has to lose which is not likely.  Likely we will go to the holliday or sun bowls. 
 Well, whatever, I am not really understanding whats going on so just call me sometime or something. 
 I said you cant just take away the dinner offer.  I wanted to go to dinner but if you thought it was going to be a big issue between you and Dave I didn't want to cause a fight between you two or something. 
 so are we just doing lunch then or dinner or dinner at your parents or what? 
 So......... 
 Well you cant just take away the dinner offer.  I just don't want to get you in trouble with Dave. 
 Uh.....sure I guess.  Would Dave have a problem with that? 
 I don't work on thursday or Friday so I could meet you guys for lunch either of those days.  Or we could grab a drink after work.  It would be nice to hang out more than just a few minutes for lunch. 
 I wouldn't stick around for someone that thinks U of O football is more important than getting married.  So, we should hang out sometime soon or something.  Boy do I have a ton of shit to tell you about. 
 Well I bet your family just feels like I was saying the other night.  That you are to close with them to actually move.  I wish you luck and hopefully you get a good offer but i would definetly think about needing more than just $35,000 to live in LA. I would think the absolute minimum you should take would be $40,000 to $45,000 plus moving costs and siging bonus.  He has been persuing you for over a year so it appears he is pretty desperate for you services.  In LA to get someone for that cheap is really a bargain.  You have got to realize it s really expensive to live there.  Especially if your office is in Beverly Hills.  You kind of have two options.  You could live in the Valley for cheaper.  But in my opinion the Valley sucks. I would never ever ever live in the valley.   Or you could find somewhere in like North Hollywood or maybe Redondo Beach.  Lisa lives there (north Hollywood)  and pays about $900 a month for a one bedroom apartment.  Which is very reasonable for LA.  Maybe Danny has some connections.   So I am curious, if Dave was to say I love you and don't go would you stay? 
 oh yeah.  Well anyway, hope you have a good week.  Take care. 
 So, you are really serious about this then huh?  I thought you were just thinking about it.  So where were you thinking of living? Have you discussed it with your family.  How much would they have to offer you in order for you to move and what kind of time frame are you thinking about.  What do you think daves reaction will be? 
 Just wanted to thank you for your help with my pay check last week.  it was greatly appreciated.  I am so tired. I didn't get to bed until 1am last night and had to be here at 5:30.  YUCK! 
 Dude thanks for the words.  I appreciate.  It has been a tough month.  I am back in portland for good now and would love to see you if your time frame allows.  How long are you in the state?  I  or have a wierd work schedule in which I work three days on t-hen two days off for four shifts in a row nt then get a six day break.  Why don't you give me a call at 503-228-7767 or on my cell at 503-702-0463 some time this evening or in the next few days.  Hope to see you while you are here 
 Thanks I so much appreciate the support.  Actually I just got back from LA today so sorry I didnt write back.  My father passed away a couple weeks ago and I have been down there taking care of everything for my sister.  It has been a rough month.  I will write back later in the week or maybe call you or something.  How is everything with you? 
 My pick for this week is Cincinnati 
 sure,  anytime this week is good for me. 
 This week picks.   I don't know if this is late but i since it is before the games have started (it is 6 am pacific right now) I am hoping that you can still put me in for Atlanta to lose to St Louis for this week.  Thanks man! 
 Yeah, I think I left a bunch of shit in those cupboards that night.  I miss that apartment to because it was so nice however, I love where I live now.  I never leave downtown anymore.   I only go out to places downtown pretty much and I don't have to drive if I want to go out for a few drinks.  I love northwest.  So how is it working out with the Kim thing.  Are you going to move out soon? As far as working nights goes the first night went fine and I was not even tired.  I am working tonight and Saturday night also.  I have next weekend off which will be nice.  Once I am up to speed I wont have to work nights. i will be working half the time nights and half the time days, so that will be a little better.  And it will be awesome to have a six day break once a month.  Not to mention the 10% raise!  Anyway have a great weekend.  Hey and if you are interested in grabbing lunch on Monday or a drink after work I have the day off.  Give me a call if you are interested. Otherwise I will catch up to ya later! 
 Thanks Greg, I am very much looking forward to the opportunity and appreciate your support.  Have a great weekend! 
 Thanks for the support Chris.  I am very excited about the opportunity.  Have a great weekend! 
 Things are good.  I have been very busy.  Work is going really well.  Other than that not much really.  And you. 
 sorry charly.  I don't have it 
 Tim, I will be writing up the proceedures for the forward obligation report tommorow.  I will email you the proceedures.  Also let me know when you decide who's responsibility the report will be and I will come in and train them.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. 
 Susie, unfortunately I will be unable to attend these classes due to a scheduling conflict with my new position.  However, If you could let me know when the next class is it would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you! 
 i will give you a call around 6 
 That sounds good to me.  Would it be to late for you to go to the 9 o clock movie.  I have some errands to run this evening in your area so, i could just cruise over to your house around 7:00 or so and we could grab a bite to eat and then hit a movie.  Until i get up to speed I will be working three nights on (6pm-6am) then two days off then three nights on.  I think my third or fourth week I will start working some days and work a little less.  Like three nights followed by  three days iff  followed by three days on.  I will have a schedule in advance for a month.  It looks like I should get two weekends off a month and then several weekdays off.  It is kind of messed up but it is such an awesome opportunity and i am really excited. 
 Would you wanna go see a movie or have a few beers or something? I have to stay out late tonight so I can get used to the new nighttime schedule and if I just sit at home i will fall asleep.  I am going to try and stay up really late and then sleep really late tommorow morning to prepare. 
 Hey what are you doing tonight? 
 Hey I just wanted to thank you for taking me to the airport on Friday.  I owe you a couple beers.  How was your weekend? 
 No but I am getting the opportunity to trade by taking this position.  It is an awesome position in that I will learn virtually every aspect of this business and get and trade daily energy.  It is definetly a step up from my current position. 
 I have a problem,  I just accepted a new position at my work.  The hours are really fucked up and are kind of like fireman hours where I have to work some night shifts and weekends but get several days of in a row afterward.  I won't find out my schedule for the month until next week so there is a possibility that I may not be able to go if i am scheduled to work that we
