 Hey I sent this guy a food processor for about $30 that apparently got damaged in the mail. He admittedthat it was packed well, but asked me what "suggestions" I had.  I did not offer him insurance nor did he request it.  So I don't feel I am responsible.  He probably agrees although he is not happy about getting a useless item.  I was going to write him back saying sorry, but I don't feel responsible.  The USPS damaged the product and we did not agree to have it shiupped insured.  Would you suggest something different? 
 got it, thanks. 
 Hey there,  I'd like to get that cable if you are still around.  Call me on my cell if you are 713-594-2776.  Thanks.  Otherwise I'll just get it after the Xmas.  Thanks and have a nice holiday.  Eric
