 Hey I sent this guy a food processor for about $30 that apparently got damaged in the mail. He admittedthat it was packed well, but asked me what "suggestions" I had.  I did not offer him insurance nor did he request it.  So I don't feel I am responsible.  He probably agrees although he is not happy about getting a useless item.  I was going to write him back saying sorry, but I don't feel responsible.  The USPS damaged the product and we did not agree to have it shiupped insured.  Would you suggest something different? 
 got it, thanks.

 Thanks.  Dad has had problems digesting food lately.  It just gets stuck in there.  So Sasha took him to the hospital.  They used tubes to remove some of the food that has been stuck, but they are not sure what types of treatment they will do now.  I will keep you guys posted.  Eric

 I sold the 10 MW off peak to STEC.  Enpower 796442.  I thought the length was in the Asset book, but it appeared that the lenth was in the Ercot Mngmnt book.  So I put the sale in that book to keep everyone flat.  I did not make any other changes to Enpower.  Eric

 Hey there,  Hope everything is going well.  I have some bad news.  In case you have not heard, my Dad passed on a week ago Sunday.  I was in LA for Adnan's wedding when my brother called.  Drove up to SF Sunday night, funeral was Monday afternoon.  I stayed in SF for a couple days, but there wasn't much I needed to do.  My brother is and will be taking care of paperwork and my Dad's apt and stuff like that.  So I drove back down to LA and stayed there for a couple days before returning to Houston.  Life at Enron is pretty down these days.  I am very fortunate to still be employed.  As you prob know of the Houston employees were cut loose last Monday.  On Friday they swiped about half of ENA.  It was a bit of a shocker.  I thought layoffs would be minimal around this group.  Origination is almost non existant now.  Some good people I worked with or out.  Since I wasn't here Friday, I was really nervous coming in.  But I think it's ok for now.  They are in negotiations with a few banks to buy the floor, or what is left of it.  They'll probably form a new patnership with a new name and everything.  Honestly, I think that is llikely to happen.  It's just a question of what will be left by the time that all happens.  I see on my streamer that CPN is down to 18 1/4.  Ouch.  Morgan Stanley downgraded the whole sector, what a bunch of geniuses.  Let's just hope for the best.  Ok then drop me a line when you have a chance.  My home
