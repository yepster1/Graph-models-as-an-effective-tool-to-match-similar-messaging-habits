 In the morning could you please call to Omaha and ask who could print out enough copies of the attached presentation for the attendees of the 9:00 meeting and forward this to them?  Thanks Audrey! 
 I believe what Lisa (Sawyer?) was referring to is the termination of TW's shared cost surcharge effective October 31, 2001.  I don't think there would be any system changes required.  Typically, TW's rates are entered with a start and end date and (if this is correct) the surcharge should have an end date of 10/31/2001 and there wouldn't be anything else to do.  If it's not entered that way, an end date could be entered now (whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level - the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts) and that should take care of it.  Elizabeth,  Is this correct?  I know you're on a project, please let me know if you can check this or who can.  Thank you! Lindy 
 The note "need to verify" appears on this slide, after the bullet "110,000 MMcfd annual average increase".  I calculated this average annual amount from the first bullet "CA's natural gas use will increase from 6,400 MMcfd in 2000 to 7,500 MMcfd in 2010".  The first bullet and the third bullet are from the same source as the graph, The California Energy Commission.  Specifically, it's from their "California Natural Gas Analysis and Issues" Staff Report, dated November 2000.  The CEC's more current report from October, 2001, did not include specific long-term demand projections (it is focused on infrastructure issues).  That's the source of the numbers on this slide. 
 You are correct.  I've got my units confused - the amount on slide #11 should be 110 MMcfd.  On the San Juan slide #14, I've left out a phrase from the report.  The report reads " total basin wellhead production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/cd and is expected to decline almost 22%,  about 2.4% per year, to 3.4 Bcf/cd by 2010".  In the tabular information of the study, 1999 begins with 4,306 MMcf/d and 2010 ends with 3,351 MMcf/d. 
 I talked with Steve about this bullet.  Let's insert the phrase "...due to capitalizing on market volatility." 
 On slide # 17, as we discussed yesterday, I think we'll have to do without the 2001 throughput numbers because the FERC Form 2's aren't published yet for 2001.  We could update the presentation when the numbers are published.  On slide # 28, there's a note at the bottom "% of Revenue".  What do we need here?  Do I need to get you a number(s)? 
 I would recommend the following assumptions for capacity resubscription fro= m now through Q3 2006:  The historical average rates should be assumed for the resubscription of Ea= st and Ignacio to Blanco capacity rolling-off during this time period.  The= forward curves that have been discussed represent the value of capacity to= California, not East to East or Ignacio to Blanco capacity.  I don't think= that max rates for the capacity represented in these groups is appropriate= .  The max rate at $.1020 is appropriate for the San Juan group.  The appropriate max rate for the West group is $.2868.  The volume of Ignacio to Blanco capacity available for resubscription shoul= d be reduced.  Today, we have contracts from Ignacio to the Blanco Hub that= then continue on Transwestern on another contract.  (These contracts exist= ed before Transwestern owned this line and were assigned to Transwestern wh= en we purchased the facilities from NWPL.)  Because of this "artificial bre= ak" in the contracts, Transwestern is collecting the San Juan lateral rate = once on a contract from Ignacio to Blanco and then again on another contrac= t from Blanco to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  In the future, when this c= apacity is resubscribed, the contracts will most likely not be split at the= Blanco Hub and Transwestern will only extract the San Juan lateral rate on= ce from Ignacio to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  Jan and I will look at t= he Ignacio capacity that has historically continued on Transwestern south o= f the Blanco Hub (vs. delivering to El Paso at Blanco).  We will come up wi= th a % to be applied to the Ignacio to Blanco capacity that should be resub= scribed at a zero rate (or the capacity to be resubscribed can be reduced -= whichever is easier to put in the model). 
 Attached is the spreadsheet updated for the I to I deals.  Please see the first tab for summarized info. 
 I took vacation (8) on February 1st. 
 It's showing the percentage of capacity subscribed vs. total capacity. 
 The fuel assumptions to be backed-out of the spread should be:  2002 - 2006	San Juan to CA		4.75% 2002 - 2006	Permian to CA		5.00% 2007 - on	San Juan to CA		2.50% 2007 - on	Permian to CA		2.50%  Kevin, Tracy, Steve, Paul - Let me know if you think these are not the right assumptions. 
 This morning in our meeting, we discussed 3 cases to be run in the TW 2010 model.  I've summarized them in the attached spreadsheet so we can keep track of our variables.  I will be sending you additional info for the various cases.  Please call to discuss.  Thanks, Lindy 36007 
 Thanks Mary Kay! 
 Here's the spreadsheet with numbers for the 3 cases.  Please refer to the Assumptions tab (updated numbers in the Summary, Fuel Price & Rates tabs). 
 Yipee! 
 What is the status of the draft from Gina Taylor's group?  Will they be sending it to me for review? 
 The revenue impact of the in-service delay of the Red Rock Expansion is as follows:  Volume			Plan		Revenue	Month  trsp	13,300/d	44 days		$  .05		$ 30,000	(June & July) fuel	    341/d	30 days		$2.57		$ 26,000	(June) fuel	    341/d	14 days		$2.64		$ 13,000	(July)  trsp/fuel	40,000/d	30 days		    0		      0		(June - made no subscription assumption in Plan) trsp	40,000/d	14 days		$ .38		$213,000	(July) fuel	  1,026/d	14 days		$2.64		$ 38,000	(July) ________ Total							$320,000  (Fuel calculated at 2.5% upside) 
 I didn't get a response from Tracy yesterday, so I'll ask you.  Is Gina Taylor's group working on a draft of the Business Plan?  I understood from Tracy in our meeting with Steve last Friday that someone in Gina's group would be working on a draft of the text version of the presentation.  Do you know if that's happening? 
 I've attached Michael's most recent version (from Friday) of the PowerPoint presentation I put together and I've incorporated Tracy's comments (from yesterday).  Ron Matthews had drafted a history for Tracy - it appears on a slide in the presentation.  This is all we have as far as a basic overview and history. 
 Attached is redlined draft.  Plese see changes to the History and Customers & Contracts sections requested. 
 Here is the summary of the expansions currently included in the 10 year projection.I received from James. 
 Please sign me up for the Monday March 18th session at 1:30.  Will you be sending the location? 
 What is the question? 
 I think Rich has told you that I spoke with him yesterday and would like to discuss what it would take to get a new IOS system up and running for TW.  Please give me a call or e:mail me to schedule a meeting to discuss.  I'm at 36007.  Thanks, Lindy 
 Sorry, I didn't see the questions below.  We were using historical rates (no fuel adjustment because we collect it in fuel sales) through 2006.  After 2006, I calculated an adjustment to add to the historical rates (assuming that we would recapture some of the value of the spread in the rate) and it made the rate greater than the max tariff rate.  Davis and I discussed that we didn't think we should assume anything in the models over max rate, so Davis said he would use the max rate after 2006.  (All of this is just pertaining to the West rates.)  The historical average West rate is $.2565.  The historical West rate with fuel adjustment added is $.3404.  The max rate is $.2868.  It's the same thing someone commented below (in blue) in response to the question - "if we are at average rates we would be able to get it  back (fuel over-retention) up to the max rate number." 
 It's just one slide.  The 2nd bullet is true in the recent past, but not necessarily going forward.  I'd have to check with Jan tomorrow if the 4th bullet is in the ballpark.  Neither of these bullets represent a timeframe - Gina said this is very high level.  I guess the last bullet kind of sums up our caveat.  Let me know if you have comments.  Gina said she had been running this all past Rod. 
 Tracy had suggested that we leave the Marketing Strategy to the end after we put together the 10 year plan so that we could address how we plan to meet it.  I had included in my drafts to Kevin the Mktg Strategy slides (2) from our 2002 stuff, but we probably need to expand that to address expansions etc, but I was waiting until we finalized what we were going to project in the 10 year plan.  The strategy should be the same for the Rating Agency slide bullets as for the Business Plan Text. 
 Did you have any comments?  Want anything changed/added/deleted? 
 Jan, I had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together, but I wasn't sure if it was the final, actuals for 2001.  What was TW's total actual throughput for 2001? 
 Jan, What percentage of our revenues from from demand charges in 2001?  Gina has a bullet here that says "over 90%".  Is this in the ballpark? 
 I have 1.8 Bcf/d for annual daily average for total system in 2001 on TW. 
 That's what I was asking Jan previously - does the 1.8 Bcf/d include any estimates or is that an actual number?  Gina, I am waiting for Steve to respond to two e:mails I've sent him requesting comments on the slide.  He is in Dallas today. 
 No problem! 
 Thank you! 
 Ava has received several RSVP's for the meeting, but the hotel has not received many calls for rooms.  Ava is trying to determine if the rooms still need to be blocked-out.  She will call the customers for us if we would provide the phone #'s to her.  Could you please fill in the phone #'s for your accounts and forward to Ava Garcia?  Thanks! 
 Effective March 1, 2002, I will not be working the 9/80 schedule anymore.  Please let me know if you need anything else from me.  Thanks, Lindy 
 Yes, I'll be working a regular 5x8 schedule.  What voicemail?  Are you thinking of someone else? 
 Sorry!  Here are the bullets: - 2,500 mile pipeline extending from west Texas to the California border with 1.7 Bcf/day of peak capacity - Maximum Rate Environment Due to Increased California Demand - Bi-Directional Flow Capabilities Provides Flexibility to Rapidly Adapt Regional Demand - Over 90% of Revenues From Demand Charges - Western Deliveries Fully Subscribed Through Dec 2005, Eastern Deliveries Full
