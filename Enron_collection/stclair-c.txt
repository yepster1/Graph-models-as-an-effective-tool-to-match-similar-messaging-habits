 Russell: I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney which he never responded to.  Tana, Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast. The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and the latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your system and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to you.

 Sara: We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue. You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke).  Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.

 Suzanne: FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there. Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to worry about it.  Let me know what you think.

 Leslie: I received your voice mail.  Can someone fax to me at home a copy of the latest Talisman ETA amendment that Dave F. looked at?  Also, would it be possible to indicate on what you sent to me the parts that Dave F. didn't like?  It would make it easier for me to respond and less time consuming since I don't have much free time during the day but I'm happy to help out. As Mark knows, this was a highly negotiated series of amendments over a long period of time.  My hope is that we can work through Dave's concerns without having to retrade what we had agreed to on the legal side.  My fax number here is 281-890-8862.

 Suzanne: That's a trick question which I will not answer!!  I have been getting as much sleep as Charles will let me for short periods of time.  It's really not too bad and sometimes I take a nap in the late afternoon with him.  I'm still breast feeding but my doctor said it would be okay to supplement with formula so at midday he gets a bottle which allows Bill and I to get out of the house for lunch most of the time.  I'm still running/walking in the mornings and with Bill at night and i really enjoy the break.  I just can't stay in the house all day and night.  Arthur started school yesterday and we've enrolled him in a fall tennis camp twice a week.  He has really shown an interest in tennis and i hope it continues.  I hope to get back on the court in a few weeks but that seems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probably because of the stopping and staring and the quick side to side movements.  Bill has been very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although there is not much he can do in terms of feeding Charles since that's up to me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we are sick of each other.  Once I start bottle feeding he will be able to do more.  Hope all is well with you.   I hope to maybe be up for a visit next week if I can find a time that works.  I'll let you know.  I'm really sorry to hear about Jim Grace's baby.  Please keep me posted.  It makes me appreciate more what we have.

 Julia: I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches. Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes it alot easier for me since we can trade off.  Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago just to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected. He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel very, very fortunate.  How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction with everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair  Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him while he is in school.  I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hope to see you soon.  Take care.  Carol 
 Mark, Julia and Kristina: We are planning to have Charles baptized on Sunday, September 24th and are having a luncheon at our house afterwards from 12-2.  My parents and younger sister will be in town and I would love for you to be able to meet them as well as see Charles of course.  I will be mailing invitations shortly, but thought that I would give you some advanced notice.  Don't worry if you can't make it as there will be plenty more opportunities to see Charles and of course you are always welcome to come out to the house for a visit.  Take care and see you soon I hope.  Carol

How about this heat?  Fortunately, I've been playing early in the mornings or late at night so it's not too bad. I've also am hooked on watching the Open every day - a fringe benefit to maternity leave.  Tonight should be great.  I hope one of the Williams' gets beat.  talk to you soon.

 Kristina: I'm thrilled that you are coming.  I'll e-mail you directions soon and I can't wait to see you.  I'm doing well.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot of tennis (word spread at our club that i was home during the day) and with Bill home we pretty much just "tag- team" it with Charles  and the club provides babysitting services which we sometimes use.  This has been a great outlet for me and a way to get back into shape which will take some time. Arthur is still very much into tennis and starting to play competitively. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he keeps it up.  As for Charles, he's now 13 lbs., 6 ounces and almost 23 inches long.  I have stopped breast-feeding and started bottle feeding him which seems to work better particularly at night.  He now wakes up usually just once at night and I'm starting to get more sleep which is nice.  Don't worry about waking anybody up when you call here.  Bill is usually here and Charles doesn't sleep much during the day anyway.  I've thought about coming up to the office a few times but  with Bill's schedule, Arthur's tennis and my tennis, I just haven't found a day that works.  Hopefully I'll get up there soon although I must sound like a broken record by now.  Hope you are doing well and I look forward to seeing you soon, as well as having you meet my parents and sister and of course see Charles again.  Talk to you soon.

 Sara: Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.  How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing? I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are having fun.  Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

 Suzanne: Just checking in with you.  I'm really looking forward to next weekend and I really appreciate you volunteering to bring dessert!  That was really "sweet" of you!  How are things?  Everyone here is doing great.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot of tennis and enjoying it very much.  There are leagues at our club almost every morning and with Bill at home, it has given me the opportunity to get out of the house and play with the "girls" which is alot of fun for me and is helping me get back into shape.  I hate to admit it, but between playing tennis and doing some volunteer stuff at Arthur's school, I could actually get used to this sat at home stuff although I still really miss my work and it's going to be a tough decision when I have to make it in a few months.  Charles is doing great.  Wait until you see how much he has grown.  I can't wait for my parents visit.  I just wish that they would stay longer!  Alos, don't be bashful about stopping by here when you are in the neighborhood. The only bad times are after 7 at night.  Charles gets pretty cranky around that time and we are working on trying to get him to sleep more during the day.  Part of that is our fault for being out of the house so often during the day but I need to get out, otherwise I would go crazy for sure.  Before I forget, do you remember packing my gym bag, and if so, is that something that you can retrieve easily and bring with you next Sunday?  Some of my tennis shorts are in there and if there is a way for you to find it, taht would be great.  Well I've got to go.  Take care.

 Mary: Enclosed is a draft of the CA agreement.  I spoke with DSavid this morning about the point that you had raised as item #3 in your last e-mail and given what Enron has done and might in the future do in this area, from a legal standpoint, I cannot get comfortable placing any further limitations on Enron in this agreement other than the disclosure and use limitations that are currently in the CA which we feel should protect RMS.  Ones interpretation of what is meant by "creating derivative works of" the data is to ambiguous for me to feel comfortable putting ahytning further in this CA.  I look forward to hearing from you.

 Suzanne: Sorry I didn't call you last weekend.  How's everything at the office?  Is Julia back yet?  I wrote her a card and I hope that over the next few weeks and months she can grieve and at the same time get on with her life.  I really feel for her.  Keep me posted on how she's doing?  What have you and Ric been up to?  Charles and Arthur are doing great.  Bill's mom is here for a visit and we are having alot of fun.   I had lunch with Kristina last week and she updated me on the "Enron" happenings.  Seems like every week there is a major organizational announcement.  Where do you think Scott Sefton will end up?  She seemed to thing that he might take the compensation package that apparently was offerred to him.  It was good to talk to her and get back in touch with work.  I'm still playing alot of tennis and really enjoying it. Charles is now old enough for the daycare that our tennis club provides so Bill and I go out there quite a bit in the morning to hit which is nice.  i still don't know what my long range plans are and will probably start discussing with Bill what to do in the next few weeks.  It's hard to believe that I have been out for over 3 months.  time really does fly by.  Give my best to everyone and write back when you can.  Did Stacy have her baby yet?

 I saw it twice with Arthur and then he saw it once with my dad!  We've also seen "Meet the parents" twice and Bill took his mom to see it this week. It's really good.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Suzanne Adams 10/31/00 04:30 PM 
 Sara: Looks like the 15th works for everyone.  I look forward to seeing you both then.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  It's hard to believe that Charles will soon be 4 months.  Time really does fly by and I am really enjoying my stay at home with him.  I look forward to hearing from the both of you about work.  See ya.

 Mark: Sorry I haven't called or written in quite some time but I'm in my own little world here at home.  Things are going very well here.  Charles will be almost 4 months old and I can't believe how much he has grown.  We finally have established a day and night routine for him and I'm happy to report that I'm starting to get more sleep which is nice.  I'm still running and playing alot of tennis which has helped me keep my sanity.  I have really enjoyed my stay at home.  It's nice to be able to watch  your kids grow up and both Arthur and Charles I think have really benefitted from us both being home with them.  I feel very fortunate.  I would really like to have lunch with you in the next few weeks so that I can catch up on what has been going on and begin discussing with you my thoughts about returning to work.  It's something that I haven't given too much thought to but need to as the end of the year approaches.  Here are some good dates for me.  November 13th, 16th, 17th, 21st, 22nd.  Let me know waht works for you. Sorry that I haven't brought Charles up to see everyone but with all that we have going on here it's hard to find the time to make the trip into down town.  Look forward to hearing from you.   Carol 
 Mark: That works for me.  I might try to call you next week just to catch up a little.  Take care.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Mark Taylor 11/03/00 05:55 PM 
 Taffy: Thanks.  Which person are we interviewing on each day? Carol 
 Susan: I've been intending to send this e-mail to you for a few weeks but somehow got distracted.  I was wondering how things have been going with you over the past few months and was hoping that you could send me an e-mail with your impressions of the group and how it has been doing since my leave.  As for me, I'm doing great.  Charles is really growing fast and it has been a great experience for me staying home with him.  I'm really enjoying it, although I miss work too!   I'm sorry that I haven't brought him up for a visit but we have been so busy here that it's hard to plan a trip downtown, but someday I'll make it up there.  Hope everything is going well with you.  Look forward to hearing from you.  Carol

 Sara: I am really looking forward to seeing you and Mary next week.  Bill has jury duty on Tuesday and I'm assuming that he will not be picked.  I'll let you know if we need to reschedule.  I am doing well and so are the boys.  I played tennis with Elizabeth Sager yesterday and got caught up a little bit on what has been going on but it looks like things have changed alot since my departure.  How are things with you, both personally and professionally?  How is the group doing?  I'm having lunch with Mark T. the week after next at which time I hope to get a better idea of what his plans are for me should I return to work next year.  Drop me an e-mail if you can and see you next week.  Carol 
 Suzanne: Just saw the org chnages memo.  Seems like alot has been going on.  Would you mind mailing the memo and charts to me?  For some reason, our computer does not print out charts.  How are you doing?  I'm doing great although I wish we knew who our next president is going to be.  I played tennis with Elizabeth Sager yesterday.  She is really good and I hope we get to play more.  I'll give you a call maybe later today or tomorrow.  Take care.

 Mark: I'm looking forward to seeing you on the 21st and getting somewhat caught up.  I thought that it might be helpful to you to let you know what I have been thinking about in terms of work, although I would ask that you keep this confidential until we have had a chance to talk further and make some decisions.  First, if I do return to work, it will not be until sometime in January and you and I can talk about a date that makes sense.  I think that this is consistent with what we had talked about before I left.  Second, I would like for you to give some thought to the idea of me working part-time for a period of time.  Bill and I have talked about this alot, and I feel that I need some time at the outset to make the transition from what I have been doing to going back to work.  We can discuss further what this means, but I really feel that it would not be good for me or my family for me to start off working full time.  Next, I would like to talk with you about what my responsibilities would be in the swap group if I return and have a clearer understanding of the areas in which you would want me to work, particularly now that we have more people.     I know that alot of chnages have occurred in the last few months and I'm hoping that there are specific work areas that I could devote my attention to.  Those are my thoughts for now.  As for my office, I really don't care where it is or how large it is so just do what you need to do.  I hope that you are doing well and I'm really looking forward to seeing you.  I will bring pictures of Charles.  He is doing great!  Take care.  Carol St. Clair   EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 I need to start thinking about hiring a nanny to take care of Charles, our 4 month old and Arthur, our 9 year old.  We are looking for someone that can come to our house during the week as we do not have room for a live-in.  We live off of 290 West, about 25 miles from downtown.  We would prefer someone that is legal and speaks English, but won't rule out anyone else.  If you know of someone that might be interested, please call or e-mail me.  While I would prefer not to use an agency, if you know of a good one, please let me know. Please pass this message on to anyone else at Enron that you think might be able to help.  Thanks.

 Sheila: Thanks for offering to participate.  I will probably go ahead and get her the gift certificate from Urban Retreat.  I just need to hear back from Mary before I get it.  Looks like everyone else has already gotten her a gift. Things are going great here.  Charles is now a little over 4 months old and almost 16 lbs. and is doing great.  I'm sorry that I haven't been up there for a visit but hopefully someday soon before he goes off to college I will come up for a visit!  Hope that you are doing well.  Look forward to seeing you soon.  Also, we are beginning the "nanny" search.  If you know of someone or agency that you would trust please let me know.  We are looking for someone to commute to our house each day, but can be flexible on the hours because Bill will be here.  Take care and thanks again for the offer on Suzanne's gift.  If I do something different, I'll let you know.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Sheila Tweed 11/26/00 11:48 AM

Can you and Carolyn pick a date that works for both Julia and Kristina and just let me know what you come up with?  Thanks. Carol      Robin Jordan@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/30/00 04:48 PM 
 Mark: I wanted to let you know that I did meet with Mark Haedicke last week to discuss my work situation, and in particular, coming back on a part-time basis sometime in January.  I think that he was okay with what I proposed, which is to work approx. 30 hours a week on a 4 day week.  I would like your input on which day you would prefer I take off, as my initial thought was Friday, but I'm open to suggestion on that.  I think that the next step is for the 3 of us to meet to discuss what my role in the group will be, and in particular, what work areas I will be responsible for.  I will try to set something up in the next few weeks.  I alos had lunch with Mary and Sara and was encouraged with what I heard from them.  We talked about the possibility of having a group offsite meeting in early January to talk about group goals, work assignments/areas of responsibility for each attorney etc.  What do you think about that idea?  As I mentioned to you at our lunch, I need some direction as to what my responsibilities will be when I return to the group and given the fact that we have acquired more people and more work areas, it seems like some planning and discussion as to who is responsible for what work is in order.  Let me know what you think.  Take care.  Carol 
 Carolyn: Does this date work for Julia?  It looked like from your earlier message that the 19th was the only date that worked.  Both the 12th and the 19th work for me. Just let me know which date works for both Julia and Kristina.  Thanks Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Russell: Enclosed are revised drafts of the Schedule and Guaranty.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Angela: Jeff Sorenson forarded me your letter to him regarding the Annex A letter that you received.  The reason that you received this letter was because of trades that we do with Aquila Canada Corp.  You are correct that we are in the process of finanlizing a Master with UtiliCorp but only trades with ARMC will go under that Master.  We are alos in the process of sending out a draft of the Master that we intend to put in place with Aquila Canada Corp but until that is completed, all trades with ACC will be done using the Annex A terms and conditions.  Please call me if you have any questions at 713-853-3989.  carol st. Clair

 Ms. Daley: Jeff Sorenson forwarded to me your March 21st letter which responded to the Annex A letter that we sent to you.  I left Robert Schulten a voice mail message about this some time ago and have not heard from him.  Can you and I talk about this.  We have extended our launch date until May 1st.  Our records indicate that there is a financial trade with GE that was done in August, 1999.  My phone number is 713-853-3989. Carol St. Clair 
 Mr. Dever: Jeff Sorenson forwarded to me the March 21 letter that you sent to him in response to our Annex A letter.  Your letter refers to chnages that we have previously agreed to.  I pulled the latest confirm that we entered into with your company and didn't see any chnages.  Could you please call me to discuss?  My number is 713-853-3989. Carol 
 David: Could you please confirm the following for me:  1. With ACE USA, Inc., we confirm using the "deemed ISDA" format.  For some reason they were on our Annex A list.  Do you know why?  2. We only do physical deals with Northern Indiana Public Service Company and the "Columbia Gas" entities.  Again, they too were on our Annex A list.  Thanks.  carol 
 David: One more request.  Could you have someone pull the latest confirms that we've done for the following Canadian counterparties and send them to me and Derek Davies  Thanks. Carol  710719 Alberta Inc. Bonavista Petroleum Invasion Energy Inc. Suncor Energy Inc.  These counterparties were on the latest list that Mary sent to us and according to her records, have recently done trades with Enron Canada corp.  Carol 
 Jeff: I spoke with Derek Davies.  He claimed that he knew nothing about his request to us not to send the Annex A letter to the latest set of Canadian counterparties and I made him check his e-mail for the messages that I sent him some time ago which he did.  Anyway, he had not yet spoken with these counterparties but promised to do so. carol 
 Bob: Here is the Assignment and Termination Agreement that you requested.  Let me know when it is okay for us to get it signed. Carol 
 Here is the Eta Amendment that we sent to Randy Osteen.  He has a correction that he wants to make and siad that he would be calling you. Carol 
 John: Sara and I would like to hold another lunch with your group on Friday, May 5th to go through in detail how the ISDA and CSA Masters and Schedules work. Could you please take a look at this list and let me know of any additions or deletions?  Thanks.  Carol  Bill Bradford Debbie Brackett Tanya Rohauer Rod Nelson Russell Diamond Veronica Espinoza Tracy Ngo Brant Reves Kevin Radous Tom Moran Christopher Smith Lesli Campbell Cathy Tudon Nidia Martinez Molly Harris  Thanks.  Carol 
 David: Thanks for the info.  I've got the ACE confirm. Carol 
 Joe and David: Both Williams and Richardson Products have the typical confirmation process language in their ISDA's where we send out the confirms and they have 3 days to object.  The Williams Master is governed by NY law and Richardson by Texas law so we are safer under the Williams Master if they are not signing.  With respect to Morgan Stanley, we are the confirming party.  The Master was amended to provide a procedure for them indicating their acceptance of the confirm other than by signing it and it involves them sending us a letter stating that they approve of the confirm.  I will send copies of the amendment and letter to you. Carol 
 David: I've asked my secretary to call you and set something up. Carol 
 Joyce: I have faxed to you the severability language and I look forward to hearing from you with respect to our arbitration comments. Carol 
 As we discussed last week, we are in the process of scheduling lunch seminars with credit, confirms/settlements and global contracts for the following dates:  May 5th, 12th and 24th.  Please let Sara and I know ASAP if you plan to be out onh any of these dates as we feel that it is very important that you attend.  Tana: Have you talked to the Global Contracts Group about the 24th?  Carol 
 Suzanne: Here is the complete list of credit folks.  Please send an e-mail to each of them concerning the 5th.  Please include the description that I have bolded. In our group, you don't need to include Marie or Shari. Thanks.  Carol 
 Sara and Tana: FYI.  I can't recall if I had already sent this to you. Carol 
 AnnE; Are you ready to talk about the comments that I sent back to you on the draft ETA amendment letter? carol 
 Rob: We have extended our roll out deadline until May 1st.  Do you think that we can have the Master finalized by then?  If not, we need to talk about whatever issues you amy have with respect to Annex A. Carol 
 Angela: We plan to send the draft ISDA to Carissa.  In the mean time, is there anything that needs to be discussed with respect to the Annex A letter? CArol 
 Anne: Today is bad but tomorrow I'm free from 11:30 to 3 my time or on Thursday after 2:30.  Do any of these times work for you? Carol 
 Suzanne: Could you please check the names of Cathy Tudon and Nidia Martinez?  They need to be included on this and I wasn't sure if who we sent it to covered them.  Seems like last time we had a problem sending it to them. Carol 
 Bill: Here is where I will be staying:  Westin La Cantera Resort 210-558-6500 phone 210-641-0721 fax  I will call you late tonight.  I love you!  Carol 
 Tanya and Bob: When we last met to talk about Repap I think that we decided to wait until quarter end before approachning them again.  Are we inclined to do anything at this point? Carol 
 yes.  That's okay. Carol 
 I do not have of those things.  I plan to be out May 28th. Carol 
 Lisa FYI Carol 
 Enclosed is the Stratus Ca that we discussed earlier.  Here are the main differences between our agreement and theirs:  1. Our term is 1 year. 2. Our agreement resolves disputes by arbitration, although it allows them to go to a court to obtain injunctive relief. 3. Our agreement has a much narrower definition of Confidential Information 4. Our agreement has no "use" restriction 5. Our agreement has different procedures for returning/destroying confidential information.   I will have hand delivered to Lucy the CA on ENA letterhead with my initials. Carol 
 David: Here is the language that I would recommend for the "backup" letter that we discussed this afternoon that our counterparties would send to us:   We hereby confirm that the confirmations that have been sent by you to us in connection with the transactions that are described on Exhibit A attached hereto correctly set forth the terms of the transactions between _______________________ and Enron North America Corp. confirmed thereby.  In drafting this, I am assuming that the information that would be on Exhibit A would be something like the deals numbers and perhaps trade dates.  Carol 
 Mr. Stout: Lisa Mellencamp is handling any comments to the Motion.  As for the amendments, I will get them signed up here and fax them to you for signature.  Carol 
 Stacy: Harry Stout is ready to sign these so could you call or e-mail me with the information that is needed to fill in the blanks with respect to the physical contracts.  I believe that all I need to know is how in each agreement KCS was referenced.  Tahnks. carol 
 Suzanne: David DuPre and I are going to meet every Tuesday at 4:30 to discuss confirms issues.  Could you please make my calendar do this? Tahnks.  carol 
 Lucy: Could you please forward this on tio the right person? Carol 
 Trina: Here is where I will be until around 1 on Friday  Westin La Cantera Resort  210-558-6500 - phone 210-641-0721 - fax  During Thursday and Friday from 8-12  you can leave messages at 210-558-2493.  Thanks also for the catalogs!  Carol 
 Yes.  I haven't heard from her. Carol 
 Sara: Does this work for you? carol 
 Suzanne: Yes I did.  My appt. on Monday is at 8:50 so I think that 10:30 should work assuming no complications. carol 
 Taffy: Sara and I have some swap legal issues that we would like to discuss with Mark.  We probably need about 1 hour.  Can you find a time that works for all 3 of us, if possible this week, but if not, as soon as possible next week? Thanks. Carol 
 Taffy: Could you also set up a meeting with the lawyers and legal assistants in our group for about 1 hour on Monday to discuss our legal assistant candidates? Thanks. Carol 
 Lucy: Just wanted to let you know that I have not had the opportunity to talk to Mark yet about the HDD information issue that we talked about last week but I have asked his assistant to get me on his calendar. Carol 
 susan: I'm going to be out on Friday of this week.  Is there any way that I can get this today or by early tomorrow?  Alos, please send me an updated Columbia chart.  Has any progress been made on the agreements that are still outstanding? Carol 
 Rod: I spoke with their counsel today and he promised to look at the comments that I sent him a few weeks ago and to try to get this finalized by May 1st.  I'll keep you posted. Carol 
 Susan: I'm booked Monday morning but free Tuesday morning.  Let's try for Tuesday. I currently only have a 4:30 meeting. Carol 
 stuart Trina and I spoke with Jeff Eldridge this morning and I will be sending my comments on to V&E on the new drafts that came out this morning in the next hopur.  Carol 
 Mark and Trina: My son's baseball game was re-scheduled for tonight so I will be unable to atten the party.  My boss, Mark Taylor, thought that the event was last week and so he now has my ticket.  I trust that you will say only good things about me in his presence! Carol 
 Tanya: Here is the issue with respect to the Goldman Guaranty.  The new Guarantor is now The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (previously it was The Goldman Sachs Group, LP).  In the existing Guaranty, we permitted Goldman to assign its rights to a Successor Guarantor without our consent if the Successor Guarantor met the following qualifications:  1. (a)  if the Successor Guarantor is a corporation, at least 50% of the voting stock had to be held by the same entities/persons that owned and controlled the previous Guarantor  (b)  if the Successor Guarantor is a partnership, it had to be controlled by the same entities/persons that controlled the previous Guarantor.  2. the Successor Guarantor's Credit Rating could not be lower than the lesser of (y) A2/A or (z) the predecessor Guarantor's Credit Rating prior to the transfer  3. the Successor Guarantor had to have a total net worth of at least $200,000,000  4. the Successor Guarantor had to be the direct or indirect parent of J Aron.   Their lawyer is telling me that now that Goldman is public, it cannot agree to item #1.  Are you okay if the criteria is just items 2,3 and 4?  Carol 
 Susan: Thanks for your e-mail.  Please try to make the Columbia matters more of a priority and if you need to, Tana is available to help out on the day to day stuff.  I really want to get this put behind us in the next 1-2 weeks. Thanks. carol 
 Luanne: Our credit people are okay with doing without the change of control condition that is in the current Guarnty. Carol 
 Suzanne: Please set up a meeting next week with Rod Nelson to talk about issues relating to the Reliant Energy Services draft ISDA and CSA Schedules.  We probably need about 1 hour.  Thanks. Carol 
 Taffy: That works for me. Carol 
 Adele: Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the ISDA and CSA Schedules that you sent to me:  1. In Part 1, Section (e) of the ISDA Schedule, right after the definition of PSE&G Reorganization Transaction you need to delete "S&P".  I also need to see what you are planning to put on Annex C.  2. I am checking with my credit person regarding the language that you added to Part 5, Section (h) - Transfer.  3. In the CSA, I thought that both threshold amounts were to be at $7,500,000.  In addition, in the proviso after threshold, the term "Specified Condition" should be changed to "Material Adverse Change".  A Mac would be triggered if Credit Ratings were below BBB-.  4. In Paragraph 13, Section (e), if the only types of collateral are cash or LC's why is consent required to substitute?  5. I would like to discuss with you our proposed Insert 4 to Paragraph 13, Section (h)(iii).  6. In Paragraph 13, Section (j)(ii)(2), why was the last sentence deleted?  7. I need to discuss with you just a few issues on the LC provisions.  I will send you a mark-up with my thoughts and questions.  Hopefully we can get this resolved next week.  Tuesday through Thursday of next week work best for me. I will fax to you a mark-up with my nits and comments on the lC language.  Carol 
 This looks fine to me 
 David: Can they send you copies of the confirms for these deals?  Also, Derek Davies'  fax number is 403-974-6706.  Carol 
 4:30 works for me. Carol 
 Jeff: I think that we need to continue to pursue Williams and Richardson on getting either the confirms signed or getting a letter similar to the Morgan letter that they accept the terms of the confirms. 
 Lisa: I will have Susan Bailey get these executed and then give to you.  I will be out tomorrow, but thought that you could coordinate with KCS in having them sign them. Carol 
 Anne: Thanks and sorry for not calling you.  I'm going to be out tomorrow and this afternoon is hectic so I will call you next week. carol 
 Lucy: Sara and I met with Mark today to talk in part about the concerns I had about the HDD info that third parties had requested us to provide.  He wants us to talk to you and the group further about this because there are risks associated with us giving this info to third parties if a portion of such info is info that we fill in based on our internal knowledge.  I'm out tomorrow and this afternoon is hectic so I would very much like to have this discussion at our Monday morning meeting.  does everyone on your side know about the meeting at 10:30 and can they attend?  If that time is a problem, please contact my assistant Suzanne Adams.  Carol 
 Tana: Could you please have the clerks hand deliver this to Dave Forester?  Alos, can you update Mark on what happened with Susan Bailey this afternoon with respect to the last interview and how much time if any she spent in that interview? Thanks.  carol 
 Mike and Zachary: Enclosed are the execution versions of the Amendments which have been executed by Enron and which Lisa will be sending to you for execution by your client. 
 Donald: Thanks for your message.  We are planning to meet as a group on Monday and make a decision.  I will talk to you next week.  Enjoyed meeting you. carol 
 Mark: I asked Tana to talk to you about the Susan Bailey situation so you are aware of exactly what happened today.  Both Sara and I think that it would be very helpful if you could communicate to the legal assistants what we talked about and that is that vacation day requests, doctors appts etc should be communicated in advance to the whole group and they should make sure that at the very least that the calendar reflects all vacation days.  However you decide to do that is fine with us. Thanks.  carol 
 I have a doctors appt first thing Monday.  I should be in the office between 10-10:30. Carol 
 Sara: I would prefer not to but will if you can't. Carol 
 Laurie: Thanks so much for your support.  I will have Bill drop your campaign stuff off at your house.  We are having a boyn and I have less than 3 months to go!  So far so good, although as of today, no more running and no more trips out of town.  Hope you are doing well.  Did you ever sell your baby stuff? If not, we may still be interested. Carol 
 Jeff: Here is what we are doing today with respect to the revised form of Annex A:  1. Marie sent to Bob Bowen yesterday the new forms of Annex A for ENA and ECC and it is my understanding that as of today, these forms will be used for all new Omnibus Counterparties.  2. Last week, Mary provided us with a list of new Omnibus Counterparties for the month of March and with the exception of the Canadian counterparties, we are in the process of faxing the Annex A letter which gives them until the end of April to respond.  With respect to the Canadian counterparties we are waiting to hear back from Derek before we send them the letter.  3. We need to receive from Mary a list of any additional new Omnibus Counterparties, if any, that have done trades with us since the date of the list that she gave us last week so that we can include them in the mail-out. It is my understanding that Mary will leave Marie Heard a voice mail about this today so that we can make arrangements for the letters to be sent to those counterparties.  Hopefully, that group will be small.  4. The plan is to roll out the new Annex A's to everyone beginning on May 1. I will update the Special Handlings List to include those counterparties that have requested special exceptions that we are okay with.  I will be at the Enron legal conference the rest of the week but will be checking voice mail.  Carol 
 Suzanne: Could you please call this guy and let him know that I am out of the office today and that I will call him sometime tomorrow.  Also, thanks for your message.  My doctor needs to wait until he gets the other doctor's report before we can talk so probably nothing will happen until Wednesday morning when I see him.  All I can do know is take it easy and try not to think about what might happen.  There's not much I can do and the only way that I will know that there is a problem is if I start bleeding.  The baby is fine.  He's almost 3 pounds and Arthur got to see him today which was great!  Needless to say, no more running nad unfortunately for Bill no more sex!  The one funny thing that happened was when the doctor was trying to tell us that we could not have sex and she didn't want to use the word sex because Arthur was there so she used the word "relations".  Bill couldn't understand  what she was saying and I know you had to be there but I just cracked up.  I also had a good laugh when the doctor found out that I was a runner.  She looked me right in the eye and said "no more running" which is what I expected.  Again, you had to be there!  Anyway, barring no further problems, I'll be in tomorrow and we'll just take it one day at a time.  Carol 
 Susan: Who are the Masters in place with? Carol 
 Chris: I paid 24 but their yours for 20 if you want them.  They are located in Section 324 Row 3 Seats 5-6, Terrace Level. Carol 
 Tana: Let Molly know that she has been invited to the May 5th luncheon and we can meet her there. Carol, 
 Janice: Thanks.  I will check with Alan and/or Jeff. Carol 
 Fred: Enclosed is a revised draft of the letter agreement.  Two points for you:  1. They want to roll over to next month the net payment that they will owe us for the month of March.  Are you okay with this?  2. They wanted to make it clear that their obligation to deliver barrells to us was only an amount equal to the amount that they own or control, even if that amount is less than the amount shown on the schedule or oin the Purchase Agreement.  In other words, they have no obligation to make up the difference.  Asr you okay ith this.  Alos, he told me to delete the "Amoco" language since  that lease was no longer part of the deal.  Let me know what you think.  carol 
 Jeff: Janice and I have been working on a deal with Fred LaGrasta that involves entering into a Crude Oil Purchase Agreement.  Their lawyer has come back with the following requests which Janice has asked me to run by you:  1. They want to delete the arbitration provision or at the very least delete the waiver of the right to recover attorneys fees.  They claim that this conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance which allows for recovery of attorneys fees.  2. They want to delete  subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal process.  Can we give on these points?  They owe us back payments on financial swaps that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase Agreement is to be able to offset what they owe us under the swaps with what we owe them for the crude that we purchase.  It's a long story as to how we ended up here but suffice it to say that this is our only hope of getting them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so if there is any way taht we can accommodate their requests to get the deal done, that would be great. Carol 
 Suzanne: Could you please call anyone from the credit group that has not yet responded in the next day or so and let me know when you have heard from the group who is coming?  Alos, Rod Nelosnmissed our meeting today so I need for you to reschedule it for Wed. or Thurs.  Thanks. Carol 
 I have a doctors appt. first thing and should be in no later than 10:30.  I will be in the office on Friday.  Carol 
 Chris: Here is where I will be just in case.  I will alos be checking my voice mail.  My assistant, Suzanne Adams (37340), will be sending a package to my house sometime late Friday morning if there is anything that you want me to see before Monday. carol 
 Brenda: Here is that internal memo that I was referring to.  Alos, could you please have Joyce send those resumes to me as we are anxious to talk to the candidates as soon as possible.  Tahnks. Carol 
 Elizabeth: Per my voice mail, here is a description of the project that I am working on with Lou Stoler. Carol 
 FYI.  I spoke with Lisa Mellencamp about Donald yesterday and her contact had nothing bad to report about him from a work standpoint.  The only negative comment that she had was on a personal basis as she described him as being a "flirt" at the firm who on occassion has taken a liking to certain female employees at the firm.  Apparently, with one particular employee he was quite a pest. Carol 
 Gary: Could you please call me at ext. 33989 and explain to me how this termination procedure works so that I can describe it in the ETA amendments that I am preparing for those customers that have requested the right to terminate? Thanks. carol 
 Donald: Thanks for your e-mail and phone mail message. It would be very helpful to us if we could talk to someone at Gardere Wynne although I understand how difficult that may be given your situation.  Could you please give it some more thought and if you could come up with someone let me know.  In the meantime, I will call your other references. Carol 
 Please review this applicant's resume and let me know if you think we should interbiew her. Carol 
 Sara: What do you think? Carol 
 Tanya: Actually they are okay with our Guaranty.  I am waiting to get theirs and will follow up with their counsel today. carol 
 Luanne: Just wanted to see where things stood from your end on your Guaranty.  We have been asked to consent to an assignment of trades bewteen J Aron and Statoil and would very much like toi finalize the new Master before we give our consent.  Please call me when convenient to discuss. Carol 
 adele: Just wanted to get back to you regarding the one remaining issue on the ISDA Schedule.  With respect to Section 7 - Transfer, we would like to keep the original language.  We view the "credit rating" language as a one time exception which if we need to we can deal with separately, but any subsequent transfers after that we want to use the more generic language.  Can we set up a call to discuss this and my other comments which I sent to you?  Let me know some times this week that work for you.  Thanks. carol 
 Suzanne: There may be a few more parties that the letter will need to go out to. Marie will find out tomorrow and will contact you.  If you have any questions about any fax nos. or addresses, Mary Gosnell can help you.  Thanks for helping out. Carol 
 Susan: Sara and I want you to meet and talk to Jackie McKoy and Stephanie Panus so I have asked Taffy to set that up.  Sara and I plan to talk with them again as well.  Susan and Tana: If you would like to join Susan in talking to either of the 2, just let Taffy know.   Carol 
 Trina: This looked fine.  My only comment is in the Contingent Adjustment Amount, is it clear to you what the term "Shares" covers?  Carol 
 Thursday Am is fine.  I will try to be home by 7 on Thursday. Carol 
 Cynthia: Thanks for sending this.  Just 2 questions:  1. In Section 7 of Annex 1 could we please add the recording language?  2. I understand from our folks that most notices are provided over the phone and not necessarily followed up in writing and that this is the practice. Can we provide for that in Section 13 of the Agreement?  Carol 
 Luanne: Thanks.  I will take a look at this.  Please do prepare execution sets of everything.  If you send them to me by mail (e-mail would be fine too) my address is 1400 Smith Street, Suite 3892, Houston, Texas 77002. Carol 
 Luanne: This looked fine.  In the first paragraph please change the name from Enron Risk Management Services Corp. to Enron North America Corp.  I look forward to receiving the paperwork from you and getting this wrapped up. Carol 
 Tanya and Tana: We have reached agreement with J Aron on everything.  I hope to receive execution docs soon. Carol 
 Tana: FYI.  This is who I am dealing with at J Aron. carol 
 Gaurav: Thanks for the info.  I left a voice mail for Lou Stoler about the need to get outside counsel involved and he is going to look into that.  I will send you the CA shortly as it is in the process of being prepared.  I also spoke with Elizabeth Sager in the power group about assisting in the documentation of the derivative and she has agreed to help.  It may be a good idea to schedule a meeting with me, Elizabeth, Lou , you and others to walk through the derivative piece in more detail so that the power folks can ask you questions about it.  My assistant Suzanne Adams has my schedule (37340), Elizabeth's assistant is Brenda Whitehead (35438) and Lou's assistant is Dina Snow (57099). Carol 
 Leslie: I'm hoping you can help me answer a questions that John Roberts of GPU raised regarding their desire to sign up on EnronOnline.  GPU Utilitiues is the parent  corp that has 3 operating subs under it (Metropolitan Edison Company, Pennsylvania Electric Company and Jersey Central Power & Light).  He mentioned that there is some type of Services Agreement bewteen EPMI and GPU Services Corp.  He wants to know which legal entity should be on the omline application.  Can you help? Carol 
 Brant: Aquila Canada has been striking the "affiliate" language in the setpoff provisions of Annex A to the Onibus confirmation.  Are you okay with this?  Carol 
 Lisa: I'll be interested in their response.  Stacy is still working on the form of amendment and we had hoped to fax it to KCS sometime tomorrow.  Carol 
 Mary: I spoke with John roberts today.  He will send me their comments to the ETA shortly. Carol 
 Rod: Here are their credit issues:  1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its obligations under the Master is "endangered", then no cross default is triggered.  2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the "materially weaker" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?  3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold language.  4. They are saying that for "operational" purposes, they cannot agree to "netting".  5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.  6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally the following procedures apply:  a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral request was made.  b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request  c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the "Resolution Time" and if a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and market quotations have to be obtained.  We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the dispute on their own.  What do you think?  7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to last.  Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could resolve with your counterpart at DB.  Carol 
 Gaurav: Thanks. Could you e-mail me the address for ACE so that I can complete the CA? Carol 
 Susan: We have finally had a chance to internally discuss the comments that you sent to Marie Heard on March 21 by e-mail and here is our response:  ISDA Comments  1. Item #1 is fine  2. We will agree to $100,000,00 for both parties  3. It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.  As a compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of 2 years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.  4. Item #4 is fine.  5. Our credit people want to keep MAC where it is as a trigger that reduces the collateral threshold to zero.  6. I would like to discuss with you what we are doing with the existing Guarantys.  7. Item #7 is okay but we would prefer a separate termination agreement.  8. I need to discuss with you items #8 and 10  CSA COMMENTS  1. Item #1 is fine  2. We cannot agree to item #2 and would like for it to remain at 20  3. I would like to discuss item #3 with you  Also, some of the changes that were made were not marked (i.e., no fault termination was not in our draft, but in yours).  Could you please e-mail me your latest versions so that I can make sure that I have seen all of the changes?  With respect to no-fault termination, we cannot as a policy matter agree to that.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Carol (713-853-3989) 
 Brant: FYI Carol 
 Jeff and Alicia: Do we need to discuss these issues?  If so, I'm available this mornoing before 10:45 and after 12:15. carol Carol 
 David: To whose attention ahould a counterparty fax termination notices to? Carol 
 Bill: You can spend all weekend doing it, but one of us needs to be at his game and I will  not be able to make a 6 o'clock game.  Could you please skip Wednesday?  Alos, if Chelsea cannot do Monday, who will?  Also, as we have discussed previuosly, I would prefer not to handle these types of discussions by e-mail.  Please call me or talk to me when we are at home.  This is not a practice that I think is in the best interests of either of us to continue. Carol 
 Jeff: I'm inclined to give in to their comment but I would like some confirmation from V&E that what they have said about past deals is correct.  Alicia, could you check this? Carol 
 David and Louise: I am working with Bob on a confidentiality agreement with Organic Inc. which contains a mutual "no solicitation" provisions that would prevent either party from hiring or soliciting for employment any employee or independent contractor of the other for a period that would expire 6 months after the termination of any business relationship of the parties.   How do you feel about this? Carol 
 Linda: I understand that Stacy will be coordinating with you tomorrow to get this completed.  When it is done, I need for you to fax it to Harry Stout (713-877-8006(phone))(713-877-1394 (Fax)) and Zachary May (212-310-8000 - phone)(212-310-8007 - fax).  Thanks.  Carol 
 Jeff: Sorry this took so long but here are my
