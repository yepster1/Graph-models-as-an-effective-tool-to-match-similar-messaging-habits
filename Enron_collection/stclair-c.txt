 Russell: I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney which he never responded to.  Tana, Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast. The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and the latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your system and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to you.

 Sara: We have never gotten comfortable with the Canadian cash collateral issue. You may recall that Shari recently looked into this but her situation was limited to a particular counterparty.  I was never comfortable with the advice that I got from Blake, Cassells and would suggest that we follow up with stikeman which is who Shari worked with.  She may have some updated memos on this in the file she was working on (I think it was Duke).  Molly and I never talked about this.  Mark needs to pick someone who should be in charge.  Molly was never interested in meeting to talk globally about this but I think that a meeting with her and Bradford needs to occur.  Take care.  Got to go.  Hope to see you in about 2 weeks.

 Suzanne: FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there. Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to worry about it.  Let me know what you think.

 Leslie: I received your voice mail.  Can someone fax to me at home a copy of the latest Talisman ETA amendment that Dave F. looked at?  Also, would it be possible to indicate on what you sent to me the parts that Dave F. didn't like?  It would make it easier for me to respond and less time consuming since I don't have much free time during the day but I'm happy to help out. As Mark knows, this was a highly negotiated series of amendments over a long period of time.  My hope is that we can work through Dave's concerns without having to retrade what we had agreed to on the legal side.  My fax number here is 281-890-8862.

 Suzanne: That's a trick question which I will not answer!!  I have been getting as much sleep as Charles will let me for short periods of time.  It's really not too bad and sometimes I take a nap in the late afternoon with him.  I'm still breast feeding but my doctor said it would be okay to supplement with formula so at midday he gets a bottle which allows Bill and I to get out of the house for lunch most of the time.  I'm still running/walking in the mornings and with Bill at night and i really enjoy the break.  I just can't stay in the house all day and night.  Arthur started school yesterday and we've enrolled him in a fall tennis camp twice a week.  He has really shown an interest in tennis and i hope it continues.  I hope to get back on the court in a few weeks but that seems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probably because of the stopping and staring and the quick side to side movements.  Bill has been very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although there is not much he can do in terms of feeding Charles since that's up to me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we are sick of each other.  Once I start bottle feeding he will be able to do more.  Hope all is well with you.   I hope to maybe be up for a visit next week if I can find a time that works.  I'll let you know.  I'm really sorry to hear about Jim Grace's baby.  Please keep me posted.  It makes me appreciate more what we have.

 Julia: I thought that it would be easier to e-mail you since we keep missing each other on the phone.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  Charles keeps growing.  At his last visit last week he was 11 1/2 pounds and 22 inches. Needless to say he likes to eat.  He is gradually starting to sleep more at night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not getting alot of sleep.  Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes it alot easier for me since we can trade off.  Physically, I am feeling almost 100%.  I started running a few weeks ago just to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.  Arthur is very much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.  He played in his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.  Bill and I are hoping that he keeps it up.  He has been great with the baby as I expected. He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.  I feel very, very fortunate.  How are you doing and how are the boys?  I miss work and the interaction with everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.  I think that you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think about it.  I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just beginning to feel good physically.  Carol St. Clair  Arthur is back in school and is a big help at home.  I'm enjoying being home with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him while he is in school.  I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.  How are your parents doing?  Please give them my best.  I keep promising to come up for a visit and I will soon.  Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.  Hope to see you soon.  Take care.  Carol 
 Mark, Julia and Kristina: We are planning to have Charles baptized on Sunday, September 24th and are having a luncheon at our house afterwards from 12-2.  My parents and younger sister will be in town and I would love for you to be able to meet them as well as see Charles of course.  I will be mailing invitations shortly, but thought that I would give you some advanced notice.  Don't worry if you can't make it as there will be plenty more opportunities to see Charles and of course you are always welcome to come out to the house for a visit.  Take care and see you soon I hope.  Carol

How about this heat?  Fortunately, I've been playing early in the mornings or late at night so it's not too bad. I've also am hooked on watching the Open every day - a fringe benefit to maternity leave.  Tonight should be great.  I hope one of the Williams' gets beat.  talk to you soon.

 Kristina: I'm thrilled that you are coming.  I'll e-mail you directions soon and I can't wait to see you.  I'm doing well.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot of tennis (word spread at our club that i was home during the day) and with Bill home we pretty much just "tag- team" it with Charles  and the club provides babysitting services which we sometimes use.  This has been a great outlet for me and a way to get back into shape which will take some time. Arthur is still very much into tennis and starting to play competitively. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he keeps it up.  As for Charles, he's now 13 lbs., 6 ounces and almost 23 inches long.  I have stopped breast-feeding and started bottle feeding him which seems to work better particularly at night.  He now wakes up usually just once at night and I'm starting to get more sleep which is nice.  Don't worry about waking anybody up when you call here.  Bill is usually here and Charles doesn't sleep much during the day anyway.  I've thought about coming up to the office a few times but  with Bill's schedule, Arthur's tennis and my tennis, I just haven't found a day that works.  Hopefully I'll get up there soon although I must sound like a broken record by now.  Hope you are doing well and I look forward to seeing you soon, as well as having you meet my parents and sister and of course see Charles again.  Talk to you soon.

 Sara: Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.  How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing? I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are having fun.  Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

 Suzanne: Just checking in with you.  I'm really looking forward to next weekend and I really appreciate you volunteering to bring dessert!  That was really "sweet" of you!  How are things?  Everyone here is doing great.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot of tennis and enjoying it very much.  There are leagues at our club almost every morning and with Bill at home, it has given me the opportunity to get out of the house and play with the "girls" which is alot of fun for me and is helping me get back into shape.  I hate to admit it, but between playing tennis and doing some volunteer stuff at Arthur's school, I could actually get used to this sat at home stuff although I still really miss my work and it's going to be a tough decision when I have to make it in a few months.  Charles is doing great.  Wait until you see how much he has grown.  I can't wait for my parents visit.  I just wish that they would stay longer!  Alos, don't be bashful about stopping by here when you are in the neighborhood. The only bad times are after 7 at night.  Charles gets pretty cranky around that time and we are working on trying to get him to sleep more during the day.  Part of that is our fault for being out of the house so often during the day but I need to get out, otherwise I would go crazy for sure.  Before I forget, do you remember packing my gym bag, and if so, is that something that you can retrieve easily and bring with you next Sunday?  Some of my tennis shorts are in there and if there is a way for you to find it, taht would be great.  Well I've got to go.  Take care.

 Mary: Enclosed is a draft of the CA agreement.  I spoke with DSavid this morning about the point that you had raised as item #3 in your last e-mail and given what Enron has done and might in the future do in this area, from a legal standpoint, I cannot get comfortable placing any further limitations on Enron in this agreement other than the disclosure and use limitations that are currently in the CA which we feel should protect RMS.  Ones interpretation of what is meant by "creating derivative works of" the data is to ambiguous for me to feel comfortable putting ahytning further in this CA.  I look forward to hearing from you.

 Suzanne: Sorry I didn't call you last weekend.  How's everything at the office?  Is Julia back yet?  I wrote her a card and I hope that over the next few weeks and months she can grieve and at the same time get on with her life.  I really feel for her.  Keep me posted on how she's doing?  What have you and Ric been up to?  Charles and Arthur are doing great.  Bill's mom is here for a visit and we are having alot of fun.   I had lunch with Kristina last week and she updated me on the "Enron" happenings.  Seems like every week there is a major organizational announcement.  Where do you think Scott Sefton will end up?  She seemed to thing that he might take the compensation package that apparently was offerred to him.  It was good to talk to her and get back in touch with work.  I'm still playing alot of tennis and really enjoying it. Charles is now old enough for the daycare that our tennis club provides so Bill and I go out there quite a bit in the morning to hit which is nice.  i still don't know what my long range plans are and will probably start discussing with Bill what to do in the next few weeks.  It's hard to believe that I have been out for over 3 months.  time really does fly by.  Give my best to everyone and write back when you can.  Did Stacy have her baby yet?

 I saw it twice with Arthur and then he saw it once with my dad!  We've also seen "Meet the parents" twice and Bill took his mom to see it this week. It's really good.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Suzanne Adams 10/31/00 04:30 PM 
 Sara: Looks like the 15th works for everyone.  I look forward to seeing you both then.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  It's hard to believe that Charles will soon be 4 months.  Time really does fly by and I am really enjoying my stay at home with him.  I look forward to hearing from the both of you about work.  See ya.

 Mark: Sorry I haven't called or written in quite some time but I'm in my own little world here at home.  Things are going very well here.  Charles will be almost 4 months old and I can't believe how much he has grown.  We finally have established a day and night routine for him and I'm happy to report that I'm starting to get more sleep which is nice.  I'm still running and playing alot of tennis which has helped me keep my sanity.  I have really enjoyed my stay at home.  It's nice to be able to watch  your kids grow up and both Arthur and Charles I think have really benefitted from us both being home with them.  I feel very fortunate.  I would really like to have lunch with you in the next few weeks so that I can catch up on what has been going on and begin discussing with you my thoughts about returning to work.  It's something that I haven't given too much thought to but need to as the end of the year approaches.  Here are some good dates for me.  November 13th, 16th, 17th, 21st, 22nd.  Let me know waht works for you. Sorry that I haven't brought Charles up to see everyone but with all that we have going on here it's hard to find the time to make the trip into down town.  Look forward to hearing from you.   Carol 
 Mark: That works for me.  I might try to call you next week just to catch up a little.  Take care.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Mark Taylor 11/03/00 05:55 PM 
 Taffy: Thanks.  Which person are we interviewing on each day? Carol 
 Susan: I've been intending to send this e-mail to you for a few weeks but somehow got distracted.  I was wondering how things have been going with you over the past few months and was hoping that you could send me an e-mail with your impressions of the group and how it has been doing since my leave.  As for me, I'm doing great.  Charles is really growing fast and it has been a great experience for me staying home with him.  I'm really enjoying it, although I miss work too!   I'm sorry that I haven't brought him up for a visit but we have been so busy here that it's hard to plan a trip downtown, but someday I'll make it up there.  Hope everything is going well with you.  Look forward to hearing from you.  Carol

 Sara: I am really looking forward to seeing you and Mary next week.  Bill has jury duty on Tuesday and I'm assuming that he will not be picked.  I'll let you know if we need to reschedule.  I am doing well and so are the boys.  I played tennis with Elizabeth Sager yesterday and got caught up a little bit on what has been going on but it looks like things have changed alot since my departure.  How are things with you, both personally and professionally?  How is the group doing?  I'm having lunch with Mark T. the week after next at which time I hope to get a better idea of what his plans are for me should I return to work next year.  Drop me an e-mail if you can and see you next week.  Carol 
 Suzanne: Just saw the org chnages memo.  Seems like alot has been going on.  Would you mind mailing the memo and charts to me?  For some reason, our computer does not print out charts.  How are you doing?  I'm doing great although I wish we knew who our next president is going to be.  I played tennis with Elizabeth Sager yesterday.  She is really good and I hope we get to play more.  I'll give you a call maybe later today or tomorrow.  Take care.

 Mark: I'm looking forward to seeing you on the 21st and getting somewhat caught up.  I thought that it might be helpful to you to let you know what I have been thinking about in terms of work, although I would ask that you keep this confidential until we have had a chance to talk further and make some decisions.  First, if I do return to work, it will not be until sometime in January and you and I can talk about a date that makes sense.  I think that this is consistent with what we had talked about before I left.  Second, I would like for you to give some thought to the idea of me working part-time for a period of time.  Bill and I have talked about this alot, and I feel that I need some time at the outset to make the transition from what I have been doing to going back to work.  We can discuss further what this means, but I really feel that it would not be good for me or my family for me to start off working full time.  Next, I would like to talk with you about what my responsibilities would be in the swap group if I return and have a clearer understanding of the areas in which you would want me to work, particularly now that we have more people.     I know that alot of chnages have occurred in the last few months and I'm hoping that there are specific work areas that I could devote my attention to.  Those are my thoughts for now.  As for my office, I really don't care where it is or how large it is so just do what you need to do.  I hope that you are doing well and I'm really looking forward to seeing you.  I will bring pictures of Charles.  He is doing great!  Take care.  Carol St. Clair   EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 I need to start thinking about hiring a nanny to take care of Charles, our 4 month old and Arthur, our 9 year old.  We are looking for someone that can come to our house during the week as we do not have room for a live-in.  We live off of 290 West, about 25 miles from downtown.  We would prefer someone that is legal and speaks English, but won't rule out anyone else.  If you know of someone that might be interested, please call or e-mail me.  While I would prefer not to use an agency, if you know of a good one, please let me know. Please pass this message on to anyone else at Enron that you think might be able to help.  Thanks.

 Sheila: Thanks for offering to participate.  I will probably go ahead and get her the gift certificate from Urban Retreat.  I just need to hear back from Mary before I get it.  Looks like everyone else has already gotten her a gift. Things are going great here.  Charles is now a little over 4 months old and almost 16 lbs. and is doing great.  I'm sorry that I haven't been up there for a visit but hopefully someday soon before he goes off to college I will come up for a visit!  Hope that you are doing well.  Look forward to seeing you soon.  Also, we are beginning the "nanny" search.  If you know of someone or agency that you would trust please let me know.  We are looking for someone to commute to our house each day, but can be flexible on the hours because Bill will be here.  Take care and thanks again for the offer on Suzanne's gift.  If I do something different, I'll let you know.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Sheila Tweed 11/26/00 11:48 AM

Can you and Carolyn pick a date that works for both Julia and Kristina and just let me know what you come up with?  Thanks. Carol      Robin Jordan@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS 11/30/00 04:48 PM 
 Mark: I wanted to let you know that I did meet with Mark Haedicke last week to discuss my work situation, and in particular, coming back on a part-time basis sometime in January.  I think that he was okay with what I proposed, which is to work approx. 30 hours a week on a 4 day week.  I would like your input on which day you would prefer I take off, as my initial thought was Friday, but I'm open to suggestion on that.  I think that the next step is for the 3 of us to meet to discuss what my role in the group will be, and in particular, what work areas I will be responsible for.  I will try to set something up in the next few weeks.  I alos had lunch with Mary and Sara and was encouraged with what I heard from them.  We talked about the possibility of having a group offsite meeting in early January to talk about group goals, work assignments/areas of responsibility for each attorney etc.  What do you think about that idea?  As I mentioned to you at our lunch, I need some direction as to what my responsibilities will be when I return to the group and given the fact that we have acquired more people and more work areas, it seems like some planning and discussion as to who is responsible for what work is in order.  Let me know what you think.  Take care.  Carol 
 Carolyn: Does this date work for Julia?  It looked like from your earlier message that the 19th was the only date that worked.  Both the 12th and the 19th work for me. Just let me know which date works for both Julia and Kristina.  Thanks Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Russell: Enclosed are revised drafts of the Schedule and Guaranty.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Angela: Jeff Sorenson forarded me your letter to him regarding the Annex A letter that you received.  The reason that you received this letter was because of trades that we do with Aquila Canada Corp.  You are correct that we are in the process of finanlizing a Master with UtiliCorp but only trades with ARMC will go under that Master.  We are alos in the process of sending out a draft of the Master that we intend to put in place with Aquila Canada Corp but until that is completed, all trades with ACC will be done using the Annex A terms and conditions.  Please call me if you have any questions at 713-853-3989.  carol st. Clair

 Ms. Daley: Jeff Sorenson forwarded to me your March 21st letter which responded to the Annex A letter that we sent to you.  I left Robert Schulten a voice mail message about this some time ago and have not heard from him.  Can you and I talk about this.  We have extended our launch date until May 1st.  Our records indicate that there is a financial trade with GE that was done in August, 1999.  My phone number is 713-853-3989. Carol St. Clair 
 Mr. Dever: Jeff Sorenson forwarded to me the March 21 letter that you sent to him in response to our Annex A letter.  Your letter refers to chnages that we have previously agreed to.  I pulled the latest confirm that we entered into with your company and didn't see any chnages.  Could you please call me to discuss?  My number is 713-853-3989. Carol 
 David: Could you please confirm the following for me:  1. With ACE USA, Inc., we confirm using the "deemed ISDA" format.  For some reason they were on our Annex A list.  Do you know why?  2. We only do physical deals with Northern Indiana Public Service Company and the "Columbia Gas" entities.  Again, they too were on our Annex A list.  Thanks.  carol 
 David: One more request.  Could you have someone pull the latest confirms that we've done for the following Canadian counterparties and send them to me and Derek Davies  Thanks. Carol  710719 Alberta Inc. Bonavista Petroleum Invasion Energy Inc. Suncor Energy Inc.  These counterparties were on the latest list that Mary sent to us and according to her records, have recently done trades with Enron Canada corp.  Carol 
 Jeff: I spoke with Derek Davies.  He claimed that he knew nothing about his request to us not to send the Annex A letter to the latest set of Canadian counterparties and I made him check his e-mail for the messages that I sent him some time ago which he did.  Anyway, he had not yet spoken with these counterparties but promised to do so. carol 
 Bob: Here is the Assignment and Termination Agreement that you requested.  Let me know when it is okay for us to get it signed. Carol 
 Here is the Eta Amendment that we sent to Randy Osteen.  He has a correction that he wants to make and siad that he would be calling you. Carol 
 John: Sara and I would like to hold another lunch with your group on Friday, May 5th to go through in detail how the ISDA and CSA Masters and Schedules work. Could you please take a look at this list and let me know of any additions or deletions?  Thanks.  Carol  Bill Bradford Debbie Brackett Tanya Rohauer Rod Nelson Russell Diamond Veronica Espinoza Tracy Ngo Brant Reves Kevin Radous Tom Moran Christopher Smith Lesli Campbell Cathy Tudon Nidia Martinez Molly Harris  Thanks.  Carol 
 David: Thanks for the info.  I've got the ACE confirm. Carol 
 Joe and David: Both Williams and Richardson Products have the typical confirmation process language in their ISDA's where we send out the confirms and they have 3 days to object.  The Williams Master is governed by NY law and Richardson by Texas law so we are safer under the Williams Master if they are not signing.  With respect to Morgan Stanley, we are the confirming party.  The Master was amended to provide a procedure for them indicating their acceptance of the confirm other than by signing it and it involves them sending us a letter stating that they approve of the confirm.  I will send copies of the amendment and letter to you. Carol 
 David: I've asked my secretary to call you and set something up. Carol 
 Joyce: I have faxed to you the severability language and I look forward to hearing from you with respect to our arbitration comments. Carol 
 As we discussed last week, we are in the process of scheduling lunch seminars with credit, confirms/settlements and global contracts for the following dates:  May 5th, 12th and 24th.  Please let Sara and I know ASAP if you plan to be out onh any of these dates as we feel that it is very important that you attend.  Tana: Have you talked to the Global Contracts Group about the 24th?  Carol 
 Suzanne: Here is the complete list of credit folks.  Please send an e-mail to each of them concerning the 5th.  Please include the description that I have bolded. In our group, you don't need to include Marie or Shari. Thanks.  Carol 
 Sara and Tana: FYI.  I can't recall if I had already sent this to you. Carol 
 AnnE; Are you ready to talk about the comments that I sent back to you on the draft ETA amendment letter? carol 
 Rob: We have extended our roll out deadline until May 1st.  Do you think that we can have the Master finalized by then?  If not, we need to talk about whatever issues you amy have with respect to Annex A. Carol 
 Angela: We plan to send the draft ISDA to Carissa.  In the mean time, is there anything that needs to be discussed with respect to the Annex A letter? CArol 
 Anne: Today is bad but tomorrow I'm free from 11:30 to 3 my time or on Thursday after 2:30.  Do any of these times work for you? Carol 
 Suzanne: Could you please check the names of Cathy Tudon and Nidia Martinez?  They need to be included on this and I wasn't sure if who we sent it to covered them.  Seems like last time we had a problem sending it to them. Carol 
 Bill: Here is where I will be staying:  Westin La Cantera Resort 210-558-6500 phone 210-641-0721 fax  I will call you late tonight.  I love you!  Carol 
 Tanya and Bob: When we last met to talk about Repap I think that we decided to wait until quarter end before approachning them again.  Are we inclined to do anything at this point? Carol 
 yes.  That's okay. Carol 
 I do not have of those things.  I plan to be out May 28th. Carol 
 Lisa FYI Carol 
 Enclosed is the Stratus Ca that we discussed earlier.  Here are the main differences between our agreement and theirs:  1. Our term is 1 year. 2. Our agreement resolves disputes by arbitration, although it allows them to go to a court to obtain injunctive relief. 3. Our agreement has a much narrower definition of Confidential Information 4. Our agreement has no "use" restriction 5. Our agreement has different procedures for returning/destroying confidential information.   I will have hand delivered to Lucy the CA on ENA letterhead with my initials. Carol 
 David: Here is the language that I would recommend for the "backup" letter that we discussed this afternoon that our counterparties would send to us:   We hereby confirm that the confirmations that have been sent by you to us in connection with the transactions that are described on Exhibit A attached hereto correctly set forth the terms of the transactions between _______________________ and Enron North America Corp. confirmed thereby.  In drafting this, I am assuming that the information that would be on Exhibit A would be something like the deals numbers and perhaps trade dates.  Carol 
 Mr. Stout: Lisa Mellencamp is handling any comments to the Motion.  As for the amendments, I will get them signed up here and fax them to you for signature.  Carol 
 Stacy: Harry Stout is ready to sign these so could you call or e-mail me with the information that is needed to fill in the blanks with respect to the physical contracts.  I believe that all I need to know is how in each agreement KCS was referenced.  Tahnks. carol 
 Suzanne: David DuPre and I are going to meet every Tuesday at 4:30 to discuss confirms issues.  Could you please make my calendar do this? Tahnks.  carol 
 Lucy: Could you please forward this on tio the right person? Carol 
 Trina: Here is where I will be until around 1 on Friday  Westin La Cantera Resort  210-558-6500 - phone 210-641-0721 - fax  During Thursday and Friday from 8-12  you can leave messages at 210-558-2493.  Thanks also for the catalogs!  Carol 
 Yes.  I haven't heard from her. Carol 
 Sara: Does this work for you? carol 
 Suzanne: Yes I did.  My appt. on Monday is at 8:50 so I think that 10:30 should work assuming no complications. carol 
 Taffy: Sara and I have some swap legal issues that we would like to discuss with Mark.  We probably need about 1 hour.  Can you find a time that works for all 3 of us, if possible this week, but if not, as soon as possible next week? Thanks. Carol 
 Taffy: Could you also set up a meeting with the lawyers and legal assistants in our group for about 1 hour on Monday to discuss our legal assistant candidates? Thanks. Carol 
 Lucy: Just wanted to let you know that I have not had the opportunity to talk to Mark yet about the HDD information issue that we talked about last week but I have asked his assistant to get me on his calendar. Carol 
 susan: I'm going to be out on Friday of this week.  Is there any way that I can get this today or by early tomorrow?  Alos, please send me an updated Columbia chart.  Has any progress been made on the agreements that are still outstanding? Carol 
 Rod: I spoke with their counsel today and he promised to look at the comments that I sent him a few weeks ago and to try to get this finalized by May 1st.  I'll keep you posted. Carol 
 Susan: I'm booked Monday morning but free Tuesday morning.  Let's try for Tuesday. I currently only have a 4:30 meeting. Carol 
 stuart Trina and I spoke with Jeff Eldridge this morning and I will be sending my comments on to V&E on the new drafts that came out this morning in the next hopur.  Carol 
 Mark and Trina: My son's baseball game was re-scheduled for tonight so I will be unable to atten the party.  My boss, Mark Taylor, thought that the event was last week and so he now has my ticket.  I trust that you will say only good things about me in his presence! Carol 
 Tanya: Here is the issue with respect to the Goldman Guaranty.  The new Guarantor is now The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (previously it was The Goldman Sachs Group, LP).  In the existing Guaranty, we permitted Goldman to assign its rights to a Successor Guarantor without our consent if the Successor Guarantor met the following qualifications:  1. (a)  if the Successor Guarantor is a corporation, at least 50% of the voting stock had to be held by the same entities/persons that owned and controlled the previous Guarantor  (b)  if the Successor Guarantor is a partnership, it had to be controlled by the same entities/persons that controlled the previous Guarantor.  2. the Successor Guarantor's Credit Rating could not be lower than the lesser of (y) A2/A or (z) the predecessor Guarantor's Credit Rating prior to the transfer  3. the Successor Guarantor had to have a total net worth of at least $200,000,000  4. the Successor Guarantor had to be the direct or indirect parent of J Aron.   Their lawyer is telling me that now that Goldman is public, it cannot agree to item #1.  Are you okay if the criteria is just items 2,3 and 4?  Carol 
 Susan: Thanks for your e-mail.  Please try to make the Columbia matters more of a priority and if you need to, Tana is available to help out on the day to day stuff.  I really want to get this put behind us in the next 1-2 weeks. Thanks. carol 
 Luanne: Our credit people are okay with doing without the change of control condition that is in the current Guarnty. Carol 
 Suzanne: Please set up a meeting next week with Rod Nelson to talk about issues relating to the Reliant Energy Services draft ISDA and CSA Schedules.  We probably need about 1 hour.  Thanks. Carol 
 Taffy: That works for me. Carol 
 Adele: Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the ISDA and CSA Schedules that you sent to me:  1. In Part 1, Section (e) of the ISDA Schedule, right after the definition of PSE&G Reorganization Transaction you need to delete "S&P".  I also need to see what you are planning to put on Annex C.  2. I am checking with my credit person regarding the language that you added to Part 5, Section (h) - Transfer.  3. In the CSA, I thought that both threshold amounts were to be at $7,500,000.  In addition, in the proviso after threshold, the term "Specified Condition" should be changed to "Material Adverse Change".  A Mac would be triggered if Credit Ratings were below BBB-.  4. In Paragraph 13, Section (e), if the only types of collateral are cash or LC's why is consent required to substitute?  5. I would like to discuss with you our proposed Insert 4 to Paragraph 13, Section (h)(iii).  6. In Paragraph 13, Section (j)(ii)(2), why was the last sentence deleted?  7. I need to discuss with you just a few issues on the LC provisions.  I will send you a mark-up with my thoughts and questions.  Hopefully we can get this resolved next week.  Tuesday through Thursday of next week work best for me. I will fax to you a mark-up with my nits and comments on the lC language.  Carol 
 This looks fine to me 
 David: Can they send you copies of the confirms for these deals?  Also, Derek Davies'  fax number is 403-974-6706.  Carol 
 4:30 works for me. Carol 
 Jeff: I think that we need to continue to pursue Williams and Richardson on getting either the confirms signed or getting a letter similar to the Morgan letter that they accept the terms of the confirms. 
 Lisa: I will have Susan Bailey get these executed and then give to you.  I will be out tomorrow, but thought that you could coordinate with KCS in having them sign them. Carol 
 Anne: Thanks and sorry for not calling you.  I'm going to be out tomorrow and this afternoon is hectic so I will call you next week. carol 
 Lucy: Sara and I met with Mark today to talk in part about the concerns I had about the HDD info that third parties had requested us to provide.  He wants us to talk to you and the group further about this because there are risks associated with us giving this info to third parties if a portion of such info is info that we fill in based on our internal knowledge.  I'm out tomorrow and this afternoon is hectic so I would very much like to have this discussion at our Monday morning meeting.  does everyone on your side know about the meeting at 10:30 and can they attend?  If that time is a problem, please contact my assistant Suzanne Adams.  Carol 
 Tana: Could you please have the clerks hand deliver this to Dave Forester?  Alos, can you update Mark on what happened with Susan Bailey this afternoon with respect to the last interview and how much time if any she spent in that interview? Thanks.  carol 
 Mike and Zachary: Enclosed are the execution versions of the Amendments which have been executed by Enron and which Lisa will be sending to you for execution by your client. 
 Donald: Thanks for your message.  We are planning to meet as a group on Monday and make a decision.  I will talk to you next week.  Enjoyed meeting you. carol 
 Mark: I asked Tana to talk to you about the Susan Bailey situation so you are aware of exactly what happened today.  Both Sara and I think that it would be very helpful if you could communicate to the legal assistants what we talked about and that is that vacation day requests, doctors appts etc should be communicated in advance to the whole group and they should make sure that at the very least that the calendar reflects all vacation days.  However you decide to do that is fine with us. Thanks.  carol 
 I have a doctors appt first thing Monday.  I should be in the office between 10-10:30. Carol 
 Sara: I would prefer not to but will if you can't. Carol 
 Laurie: Thanks so much for your support.  I will have Bill drop your campaign stuff off at your house.  We are having a boyn and I have less than 3 months to go!  So far so good, although as of today, no more running and no more trips out of town.  Hope you are doing well.  Did you ever sell your baby stuff? If not, we may still be interested. Carol 
 Jeff: Here is what we are doing today with respect to the revised form of Annex A:  1. Marie sent to Bob Bowen yesterday the new forms of Annex A for ENA and ECC and it is my understanding that as of today, these forms will be used for all new Omnibus Counterparties.  2. Last week, Mary provided us with a list of new Omnibus Counterparties for the month of March and with the exception of the Canadian counterparties, we are in the process of faxing the Annex A letter which gives them until the end of April to respond.  With respect to the Canadian counterparties we are waiting to hear back from Derek before we send them the letter.  3. We need to receive from Mary a list of any additional new Omnibus Counterparties, if any, that have done trades with us since the date of the list that she gave us last week so that we can include them in the mail-out. It is my understanding that Mary will leave Marie Heard a voice mail about this today so that we can make arrangements for the letters to be sent to those counterparties.  Hopefully, that group will be small.  4. The plan is to roll out the new Annex A's to everyone beginning on May 1. I will update the Special Handlings List to include those counterparties that have requested special exceptions that we are okay with.  I will be at the Enron legal conference the rest of the week but will be checking voice mail.  Carol 
 Suzanne: Could you please call this guy and let him know that I am out of the office today and that I will call him sometime tomorrow.  Also, thanks for your message.  My doctor needs to wait until he gets the other doctor's report before we can talk so probably nothing will happen until Wednesday morning when I see him.  All I can do know is take it easy and try not to think about what might happen.  There's not much I can do and the only way that I will know that there is a problem is if I start bleeding.  The baby is fine.  He's almost 3 pounds and Arthur got to see him today which was great!  Needless to say, no more running nad unfortunately for Bill no more sex!  The one funny thing that happened was when the doctor was trying to tell us that we could not have sex and she didn't want to use the word sex because Arthur was there so she used the word "relations".  Bill couldn't understand  what she was saying and I know you had to be there but I just cracked up.  I also had a good laugh when the doctor found out that I was a runner.  She looked me right in the eye and said "no more running" which is what I expected.  Again, you had to be there!  Anyway, barring no further problems, I'll be in tomorrow and we'll just take it one day at a time.  Carol 
 Susan: Who are the Masters in place with? Carol 
 Chris: I paid 24 but their yours for 20 if you want them.  They are located in Section 324 Row 3 Seats 5-6, Terrace Level. Carol 
 Tana: Let Molly know that she has been invited to the May 5th luncheon and we can meet her there. Carol, 
 Janice: Thanks.  I will check with Alan and/or Jeff. Carol 
 Fred: Enclosed is a revised draft of the letter agreement.  Two points for you:  1. They want to roll over to next month the net payment that they will owe us for the month of March.  Are you okay with this?  2. They wanted to make it clear that their obligation to deliver barrells to us was only an amount equal to the amount that they own or control, even if that amount is less than the amount shown on the schedule or oin the Purchase Agreement.  In other words, they have no obligation to make up the difference.  Asr you okay ith this.  Alos, he told me to delete the "Amoco" language since  that lease was no longer part of the deal.  Let me know what you think.  carol 
 Jeff: Janice and I have been working on a deal with Fred LaGrasta that involves entering into a Crude Oil Purchase Agreement.  Their lawyer has come back with the following requests which Janice has asked me to run by you:  1. They want to delete the arbitration provision or at the very least delete the waiver of the right to recover attorneys fees.  They claim that this conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance which allows for recovery of attorneys fees.  2. They want to delete  subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal process.  Can we give on these points?  They owe us back payments on financial swaps that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase Agreement is to be able to offset what they owe us under the swaps with what we owe them for the crude that we purchase.  It's a long story as to how we ended up here but suffice it to say that this is our only hope of getting them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so if there is any way taht we can accommodate their requests to get the deal done, that would be great. Carol 
 Suzanne: Could you please call anyone from the credit group that has not yet responded in the next day or so and let me know when you have heard from the group who is coming?  Alos, Rod Nelosnmissed our meeting today so I need for you to reschedule it for Wed. or Thurs.  Thanks. Carol 
 I have a doctors appt. first thing and should be in no later than 10:30.  I will be in the office on Friday.  Carol 
 Chris: Here is where I will be just in case.  I will alos be checking my voice mail.  My assistant, Suzanne Adams (37340), will be sending a package to my house sometime late Friday morning if there is anything that you want me to see before Monday. carol 
 Brenda: Here is that internal memo that I was referring to.  Alos, could you please have Joyce send those resumes to me as we are anxious to talk to the candidates as soon as possible.  Tahnks. Carol 
 Elizabeth: Per my voice mail, here is a description of the project that I am working on with Lou Stoler. Carol 
 FYI.  I spoke with Lisa Mellencamp about Donald yesterday and her contact had nothing bad to report about him from a work standpoint.  The only negative comment that she had was on a personal basis as she described him as being a "flirt" at the firm who on occassion has taken a liking to certain female employees at the firm.  Apparently, with one particular employee he was quite a pest. Carol 
 Gary: Could you please call me at ext. 33989 and explain to me how this termination procedure works so that I can describe it in the ETA amendments that I am preparing for those customers that have requested the right to terminate? Thanks. carol 
 Donald: Thanks for your e-mail and phone mail message. It would be very helpful to us if we could talk to someone at Gardere Wynne although I understand how difficult that may be given your situation.  Could you please give it some more thought and if you could come up with someone let me know.  In the meantime, I will call your other references. Carol 
 Please review this applicant's resume and let me know if you think we should interbiew her. Carol 
 Sara: What do you think? Carol 
 Tanya: Actually they are okay with our Guaranty.  I am waiting to get theirs and will follow up with their counsel today. carol 
 Luanne: Just wanted to see where things stood from your end on your Guaranty.  We have been asked to consent to an assignment of trades bewteen J Aron and Statoil and would very much like toi finalize the new Master before we give our consent.  Please call me when convenient to discuss. Carol 
 adele: Just wanted to get back to you regarding the one remaining issue on the ISDA Schedule.  With respect to Section 7 - Transfer, we would like to keep the original language.  We view the "credit rating" language as a one time exception which if we need to we can deal with separately, but any subsequent transfers after that we want to use the more generic language.  Can we set up a call to discuss this and my other comments which I sent to you?  Let me know some times this week that work for you.  Thanks. carol 
 Suzanne: There may be a few more parties that the letter will need to go out to. Marie will find out tomorrow and will contact you.  If you have any questions about any fax nos. or addresses, Mary Gosnell can help you.  Thanks for helping out. Carol 
 Susan: Sara and I want you to meet and talk to Jackie McKoy and Stephanie Panus so I have asked Taffy to set that up.  Sara and I plan to talk with them again as well.  Susan and Tana: If you would like to join Susan in talking to either of the 2, just let Taffy know.   Carol 
 Trina: This looked fine.  My only comment is in the Contingent Adjustment Amount, is it clear to you what the term "Shares" covers?  Carol 
 Thursday Am is fine.  I will try to be home by 7 on Thursday. Carol 
 Cynthia: Thanks for sending this.  Just 2 questions:  1. In Section 7 of Annex 1 could we please add the recording language?  2. I understand from our folks that most notices are provided over the phone and not necessarily followed up in writing and that this is the practice. Can we provide for that in Section 13 of the Agreement?  Carol 
 Luanne: Thanks.  I will take a look at this.  Please do prepare execution sets of everything.  If you send them to me by mail (e-mail would be fine too) my address is 1400 Smith Street, Suite 3892, Houston, Texas 77002. Carol 
 Luanne: This looked fine.  In the first paragraph please change the name from Enron Risk Management Services Corp. to Enron North America Corp.  I look forward to receiving the paperwork from you and getting this wrapped up. Carol 
 Tanya and Tana: We have reached agreement with J Aron on everything.  I hope to receive execution docs soon. Carol 
 Tana: FYI.  This is who I am dealing with at J Aron. carol 
 Gaurav: Thanks for the info.  I left a voice mail for Lou Stoler about the need to get outside counsel involved and he is going to look into that.  I will send you the CA shortly as it is in the process of being prepared.  I also spoke with Elizabeth Sager in the power group about assisting in the documentation of the derivative and she has agreed to help.  It may be a good idea to schedule a meeting with me, Elizabeth, Lou , you and others to walk through the derivative piece in more detail so that the power folks can ask you questions about it.  My assistant Suzanne Adams has my schedule (37340), Elizabeth's assistant is Brenda Whitehead (35438) and Lou's assistant is Dina Snow (57099). Carol 
 Leslie: I'm hoping you can help me answer a questions that John Roberts of GPU raised regarding their desire to sign up on EnronOnline.  GPU Utilitiues is the parent  corp that has 3 operating subs under it (Metropolitan Edison Company, Pennsylvania Electric Company and Jersey Central Power & Light).  He mentioned that there is some type of Services Agreement bewteen EPMI and GPU Services Corp.  He wants to know which legal entity should be on the omline application.  Can you help? Carol 
 Brant: Aquila Canada has been striking the "affiliate" language in the setpoff provisions of Annex A to the Onibus confirmation.  Are you okay with this?  Carol 
 Lisa: I'll be interested in their response.  Stacy is still working on the form of amendment and we had hoped to fax it to KCS sometime tomorrow.  Carol 
 Mary: I spoke with John roberts today.  He will send me their comments to the ETA shortly. Carol 
 Rod: Here are their credit issues:  1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its obligations under the Master is "endangered", then no cross default is triggered.  2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the "materially weaker" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?  3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold language.  4. They are saying that for "operational" purposes, they cannot agree to "netting".  5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.  6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally the following procedures apply:  a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral request was made.  b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request  c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the "Resolution Time" and if a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and market quotations have to be obtained.  We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the dispute on their own.  What do you think?  7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to last.  Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could resolve with your counterpart at DB.  Carol 
 Gaurav: Thanks. Could you e-mail me the address for ACE so that I can complete the CA? Carol 
 Susan: We have finally had a chance to internally discuss the comments that you sent to Marie Heard on March 21 by e-mail and here is our response:  ISDA Comments  1. Item #1 is fine  2. We will agree to $100,000,00 for both parties  3. It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.  As a compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of 2 years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.  4. Item #4 is fine.  5. Our credit people want to keep MAC where it is as a trigger that reduces the collateral threshold to zero.  6. I would like to discuss with you what we are doing with the existing Guarantys.  7. Item #7 is okay but we would prefer a separate termination agreement.  8. I need to discuss with you items #8 and 10  CSA COMMENTS  1. Item #1 is fine  2. We cannot agree to item #2 and would like for it to remain at 20  3. I would like to discuss item #3 with you  Also, some of the changes that were made were not marked (i.e., no fault termination was not in our draft, but in yours).  Could you please e-mail me your latest versions so that I can make sure that I have seen all of the changes?  With respect to no-fault termination, we cannot as a policy matter agree to that.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Carol (713-853-3989) 
 Brant: FYI Carol 
 Jeff and Alicia: Do we need to discuss these issues?  If so, I'm available this mornoing before 10:45 and after 12:15. carol Carol 
 David: To whose attention ahould a counterparty fax termination notices to? Carol 
 Bill: You can spend all weekend doing it, but one of us needs to be at his game and I will  not be able to make a 6 o'clock game.  Could you please skip Wednesday?  Alos, if Chelsea cannot do Monday, who will?  Also, as we have discussed previuosly, I would prefer not to handle these types of discussions by e-mail.  Please call me or talk to me when we are at home.  This is not a practice that I think is in the best interests of either of us to continue. Carol 
 Jeff: I'm inclined to give in to their comment but I would like some confirmation from V&E that what they have said about past deals is correct.  Alicia, could you check this? Carol 
 David and Louise: I am working with Bob on a confidentiality agreement with Organic Inc. which contains a mutual "no solicitation" provisions that would prevent either party from hiring or soliciting for employment any employee or independent contractor of the other for a period that would expire 6 months after the termination of any business relationship of the parties.   How do you feel about this? Carol 
 Linda: I understand that Stacy will be coordinating with you tomorrow to get this completed.  When it is done, I need for you to fax it to Harry Stout (713-877-8006(phone))(713-877-1394 (Fax)) and Zachary May (212-310-8000 - phone)(212-310-8007 - fax).  Thanks.  Carol 
 Jeff: Sorry this took so long but here are my thoughts on the above:  1. In Section 3.1 (c), I'm assuming that the additional sections were added because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust.  Is that correct?  2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I think belongs after the phrase that begins, "if the effect of such failure..."  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals?  3. Section 3.11 should be made subject to Section 5.7 or vice versa.  Carol 
 David: Thanks.  Per my voice mail messgae, are you okay with giving Cinergy the right to terminate?  This apparently is there only issue.  Also, how do you want to handle future requests for termination rights if we can't geta counterparty to back down from their request?  Do you want me to check with you each time? Carol 
 Bob: As currently written with my changes, we will return any written confidential information.  In addition, to the extent that we prepare internal analyses, memos etc.  that contain confidential information, we usually do not want to give our work product to the other party.  Therefore, we agree to keep it subject to the terms of the CA or destroy it and that is what my Insert A says and that is why I deleted their language.  With respect to the term Representative, that should be defined to mean any director, officer, employee, counsel, representative and affiliate of any party as well as any affiliate's directors, officers, employees, counsel or representative.  Have you reviewed the description of Confidential Information, and in particular, clause (d) and are you comfortable with it.  Other than the reference to the Website, is there anything else that we should add as a description of what we are showing them?  Finally,  per Louise's e-mail, she doesn't want to agree to the no solicitation language until we contract with them.  Could you please communicate that to them? Carol 
 David: Grant has faxed to me Crestar's comments to the PA and ETA.  As I explained to Grant, some of them are legal and some of them, I think, will require input from you and perhaps can be resolved in a call to them.  I am going to have this delivered to you with my thoughts on some of the comments assuming that we couldn't talk them into accepting these docs as is.  Please let me know when convenient how best to proceed. carol 
 Jim: We have finally devised a procedure for handling termination rights.  I will amend the ETA amendment letter and send it to you.  We have a new procedure in place that requires me to get commercial approval for all amendments so I first will need to run this by the head of the Online group but will send it to you right after I receive that approval.  Sorry for the delay. carol 
 David: Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt? Carol 
 Richard: Could you please take a look at point #6.  This is the online counterparty who had requested in their arbitration language that only monetary damages are available as a remedy in any arbitration proceeding and that under no circumstances shall specific performance be an available remedy against them.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.  carol 
 Susan: Thanks for the update.  Looks like we are getting close.  Let's go ahead and prepare an agreement for Morgan.  Alos, on Coral, are they ready to sign? Carol 
 Lucy: I heard back from Mark and he seemed receptive to our suggestion to consider you for the legal asst. position.  Sounded like he wnted to think about it over the weekend.  I'll keep you posted. Carol 
 Mr. May: I am working with Lisa Mellencamp on this matter and I just wanted to let you know that we will be sending you sometime tomorrow a completed draft of the amendment to the financial derivative and physical agreements that we want the Court to approve.  The purpose of the amendment is to expand our setoff rights and to add additional events of default/termination events that relate to events that may occur during the bankruptcy proceeding.  We will be out of the office the rest of the week at our legal conference but you can leave me or Lisa a voice mail message with any comments or questions that you may have.  My number is 713-853-3989. Enclosed is a preliminary draft that just deals with the financial derivative agreement.  Another lawyer in our group is handling the physical agreement amendments.  Carol St. Clair

 Mr. Oldham: Thanks.  Ed Sacks and Wendy Conwell from our credit group will be attending with me.  I will send to you early next week a list of our questions.  I am assuming that you are familiar with the EEI Master Agreement between Reliant and EPMI.  If you need a copy, please contact me or Janet Greene.

 Ed: We are really close on finalizing the EEI.  The following are open credit points with them:  1. They want their cross default to be $100 million too instead of $50.  2. They want to exclude from the affiliate definition Florida Power & Light and its subs.  Their lawyer is sending me a list.  3. They want to raise both collateral thresholds from $20 to $50 million.  4. In the assignment language in section 10.5,  they want to specify a creditworthiness test in clauses (ii) and (iii), such that if the assignee or its guarantor is rated BBB- or Baa3, the assignment is permitted.  Clauses (ii) and (iii) relate to assignments to affiliates and assignments that occur as a result of mergers or asset transfers.  Right now the test is a generic creditworthiness test.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Janet: Enclosed is some sample surety bond language that we have used along with a surety bond form.  I have reviewed your form and think that we can use it with some minor modifications. The enclosed provisions will need to be modified to fit our situation and taht is part of what I want to discuss at our meeting next week so we can all understand how the bond gets issued, what it covers and how it gets triggered.   I look forward to seeing you next Thursday.    Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Rod and Paul: I have checked the ISDA between Kaiser and ENA and it has our standard setoff language which permits setoff of amounts owed by or to the Non-Defaulting Party and its Affiliates against amounts owed by or to the Defaulting Party under the ISDA and other agreements.  Please call me once you have located the Metals agreement as Greg indicated to me in a voice mail that he needs an answer this morning.  Rod, If we get comfortable on the legal side with this arrangement, are there other credit issues that need to be considered?  Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Rod: Do you and Diana have a copy of the ISDA master between ENA and Kaiser?  If not, here is a summary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions:  1. $30,000,000 cross default threshold  2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occurs if either an Event of Default occurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreement with BankAmerica or its credit rating drops to B- or below by S&P and B3  or below by Moody's.  In each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs.  3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an Event of Default occurs.  4. $1,000,000 rounding amounts   With respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff rights.

 Keith: As we discussed, here is Enron's legal/credit issues list on the ISDA:  1. We cannot agree to cross-acceleration.  2. There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to be discussed. Enron's $100 million threshold is based on the threshold that its banks accept in its credit agreements.  3. We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.  4. We prefer the Loss method.  5. We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the "materially weaker" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the Credit Support Annex.  We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for posting an LC.  6. We would like to make the GP of Encore a "Specified Entity".  We need to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of "Specified Transaction" to include physical transactions.  7. In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a cure through the posting of collateral.  8. We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).  9. We need to discuss the arbitration language.  10. We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of Default Rate and Interest rate.  11. Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity Definitions Supplement?  12. In the "Recording" section we would like to add the phrase "To the extent permitted by applicable law" at the beginning of the last sentence.  13. We cannot agree to No Fault Termination.  14. We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial obligations. Looks like LC's would be the only form of acceptable collateral.  15. We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding amounts.  16. We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer.  I look forward to hearing from you.

 Jack: I will send you an open issues list shortly.  I considered items # 2,3,4,6, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 to be credit-related comments, some of which I need my credit person's input on.  As to the remaining points, here is my response:  1. Let's discuss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agree with you on the concept.  2. With respect to item #7,  your interpretation is correct.  3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.  As a general rule, with respect to setoff rights, to the extent that ENA is the Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's affiliates have entered into other agreements with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those affiliate agreements can be setoff against amounts owed under the ISDA.  All the guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteed under the Guaranty takes into account the exercise of such setoff rights.  4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.  5. I agree with your point #13.  6. With respect to point #14, collateral is limited to cash and LC's and the concept of a custodial account applies when someone other than the Secured Party is holding  the cash collateral.  7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash collateral when an Event of Default occurs even if we have not yet terminated all transactions.  Once we have terminated and established a termination amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.  8. The "deemed occurrence" language  is meant to cover termination events that occur automatically without either party electing to terminate, such as in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.  We could probably take it out since there is no automatic early termination on bankruptcy.  I look forward to hearing from you.  My credit person is out this week, but maybe you and I can make some progress.

 Below is a summary of the surety bond issues that I believe we need to resolve in order to feel comfortable accepting it as a form of collateral to secure a counterparty's obligations with respect to physical power purchase and sale transactions:  1.  Determine whether an issuer can refuse to honor a draw made under a surety bond if after issuance, it determines that the bond was issued in violation of the appleton statute.  What type of legal comfort should we receive from the issuer at the outset to get comfortable that the bond was validly issued and is enforceable against such issuer?  2. Determine the proper minimum credit rating(s) that should apply to the issuer.  3. In the form of bond that we were given, the "Now Therefore" language in the third paragraph is not acceptable.  Determine what can be said in its place to establish the necessary linkage back to the transaction covered by the Confirmation.  4. Make sure that the bond can be drawn down no matter what type of Event of Default occurs, even if such event is not related to the transaction that the bond references.  The Notice of Claim language needs to be written more generically to accommodate this.  5. Does credit need a "pre-bankruptcy" trigger that would require Reliant to convert all outstanding bonds into LC's or cash collateral?  If so, what would this trigger be?  Let me know if you have any additional issues.  I will be discussing some of these with our outside counsel shortly.

 Nick: Thanks.  Just a few questions for Carol and Ken:  1. Will there still be a MAC trigger and if so, will it remain at the parent level?  2. I am assuming that we still want to receive Holdings" financials.  3. Sounds like what we want AK Steel to say is that  it will remain as the only subsidiary of Holdings.  Is that the concept that you want them to covenant about in the ISDA?  I would suggest doing it as a covenant so that it would lead to an Event of Default if it is violated.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?  Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Nick Ernst/ENRON@enronXgate 05/29/2001 07:24 PM

 Keith: Thanks for your prompt response.  I can respond to some of your comments.  1. In point #1, I was referring to your change in Part 1(b) which changed Section 5(a)(vi) from cross default to cross acceleration.  From a credit standpoint, we prefer a cross default trigger.  2. I will check with Ed on point #2.  3. With respect to points #5 and 14, because of the difficulty in perfecting an interest in cash collateral in Canada (based on advice from our Canadian counsel as well as Stikeman's ISDA opinion on this issue), we do not accept cash collateral from Canadian counterparties.  With respect to surety bonds, there is a statute in New York called the Appleton Law which prohibits a surety from issuing a bond to guaranty financial performance.  For this reason, we do not accept surety bonds as collateral.  4. With respect to point #7, the answer is yes.  All of the other points need to be discussed.  Can we now schedule a call for later this week or next week to walk through the remaining issues?  Please let me know some times that work for you and Mike roach.  I am not in the office on Mondays.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Keith Ferguson <keith.ferguson@fmc-law.com> 05/30/2001 12:44 PM 
 Susan: Here is what John wants to do.  He wants to put everything under the 1996 Master Agreement and is willing to increase their collateral threshold from $10,000,000 to $16,000,000.  He also wants to increase our threshold the same.  He has alos given is permission to do our form updates.  Could you please communicate this to your contact and if they need to speak with someone in credit, please give them John's name.  Thanks. carol

 David: Have you done any memos outlining the changes to Article 9 and if so, is it something that we can see?  Also, is it your view that  New York will adopt the new Article 9 and if so, when?  Finally, given the fact that Enron's primary type of collateral are LC's and cash, and we rely on perfection by possession, do you think that there is anything about the new Article 9 that we should be worrying about?  If this question requires more time to analyze let's talk first.  Thanks. Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Mary and Sara: I spoke with Lech about the Article 9 questions.  He is going to send me some articles that they have written which I will send to you.    He alos confirmed that the cash perfection issue has not changed  under new Article 9 although his view on it was that this type of collateral under the UCC is more like a deposit account than "money" which, under common law principles, gets perfected through the exercise of dominion and control over the cash. Under the new Article 9, deposit accounts are covered and the new Article 9 codifies the common law control test.  e alos expressed a view that It may take longer than July 1st for NY to adopt the new Article 9.

 David: Here is the ETA.  I apologize for not sending it to you earlier. CArol 
 Marianne: The following are my comments:  1. In Section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.  2. In Section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert "a" before the word "change" and after the word "in".  3. In Section 6.1, change 20 Business Days to 20 days.  Also, add a semicolon at the end of clause (i).  4. In Section 6.2.1 I'll just note that the discount rate sentence I think is still an open issue.  5. In Section 6.3, clause (c) should be reworded to fit with the language in the beginning of the Section.  6. Capitalize the word "facility" in the definition of Average Annual Load Factor.  7. Delete the definition of Costs as it is already defined in Section 6.2.1.  8. Where is the defined term Govt Authority used?  9. In the GTC, the ECP rep should also apply to EESI.  Also, in the 7th line of the reps add the word "into" after the word "entered" and before the word "this".  10. In Collateral Requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.  I will also add granting/perfection language.  11. In Events of Default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which I'm not sure exists.  In clause (e), delete the "s": from the word consolidation.  12. Remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in Section 6.1.  13. In UCC/Disclaimer of warranties, add a clause (c).  I would add setoff language.    Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com    Marianne Castano@EES 05/30/2001 11:05 AM

 Russell: I have reviewed your comments to the ISDA and CSA schedules.  I need to check with our credit person to see how he wnats to handle the Independent Amount issue.  On collateral substitutionh consent rights, given the fact that we can only choose between cash and LC's is consent really necesssary?  We would prefer to be able to freely substitiute.  Let me know what you think. Carol 
 Jay: Jeff Hodge forwarded your voice mail to me.  I will give you a call later this morning to talk about the LC margin language that you need.  It might help me if you could describe how the margining will work.  Typically there is some dollar threshold against  which our Exposure is measured and anything over that threshold needs to be supported by collateral.  In addition, there is usually some Material Adverse Change trigger that reduces the threshold to zero.  Is that how yours will work?

 Bill: Thanks for the information.  I need to take a closer look at Janet's language, particularly the "null and void" language to make sure that it covers all possible events of default under the Master Agreement.  As to the Texas law issue, our ability to get comfortable from a legal standpoint will in large part be dictated by this issue.  Is there anyway to get more certainty on this with the sureties?  I understand that you don't want to go to them multiple times but this is a key issue for us.  Let me know what you think.

 Jack: Thanks for your e-mail.  I met with our credit people this morning and can respond to some of the credit points raised in your May 16th memo:  1. With respect to item #2, I know of no case law on this point and our credit group cannot agree to delete this concept from the Collateral Threshold definition.  2. With respect to item #3, we can agree to define materially weaker the way you suggested with  additional language that states that any drop below BBB- also counts as a trigger.  3. With respect to item #4, we can agree to a definition tied to an objective rate which my credit person is thinking about.  4. With respect to item #6, I'm waiting for my credit person to confirm that your comment is correct.  5. I understand from your latest e-mail that no changes will be made to the definition and use of affiliates in any of the agreements.  6. With respect to item #12, we can agree to increase our rounding amount to $500,000 and to limit "returns" of collateral to once a week.  We cannot agree to change  the frequency for requesting/delivering collateral.  Given the high rounding intervals, we feel that unless there is a huge market change, it is unlikely that collateral requests will be made every day.  7. With respect to item #14, there is no requirement to escrow cash collateral that is being held and the Secured Party is free to do whatever it wants to with the cash until the events in 13(g)(ii) occur, in which case the cash collateral must be held by a Qualified Institution.  8. With respect to item #19, if we draw the entire amount of the LC and the termination amount that we are owed is less than the LC amount, we would be required under the documents to return any excess amount to you.  All we are doing in an Event of Default situation is converting the LC into cash collateral that we hold subject to the terms of the documents.  9. We can agree to make the chnages that you requested in item #18.  I still need some clarification on the point you were making in item #17 and I will look at your other comments in today's e-mail and respond shortly. Are you okay with the Enron and Inland forms of Guaranty?

 Joe, Jeff an Bob: Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections to our new form of Annex A:  1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply  2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.  3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the "or otherwise" language in the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue.  4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few days.  5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks.  6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial derivatives with them recently.  7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with their attorney.  8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.  9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will follow up with their attorney.  10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z) to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit should be alerted.  11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response.  12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.  13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up.

 David and Louise: One of the things that Organic has asked us to keep confidential is "the existence of any business discussions, negotiations or agreements between the parties as well as any information regarding the skills and compensation of employees, contractors or other agents of the disclosing party."  This is a departure from our form.  Are we prepared to agree to this?  Also, to the extent that parties are insisting on using their form of CA, what do you want the approval process to be? Carol 
 John: Thanks for your voice mail message.  I will wait to hear back from either you or John M. before I respond to Reliant on our issues list.  I do agree with you on all of the points that they need to address.  On the Event of Default issue, do you think that Janet Greene's proposed language to the "null and void" sentence as well as the drawing certificate works?  I was concerned that the language "Event of Default under the Confirm" may lead to some confusion as to what Events of default are covered.  What do you think?

 Rhonda: Enclosed is a new revised draft of the MEGA Consent marked against the draft that they sent to us.  Here is what we have decided to do:  1. As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms. I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.  2. We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and each of Morgan and MEGA.  My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer how this cutoff date works.  3. We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.  Call me if you have any questions.

 Sarah: What a mess this is.  I need your advice on what I should do.  I was told that the only way that I can play on the Rice team is to either play with a 3.5 man or not to play on my Tuesday night league.  Bill tells me that there are no 3.5 men available to add to our roster.  Is that true?  This is really a difficult choice for me because I really enjoy playing on the Tuesday night team and i still feel that we have a chance to advance further.  What do you think I should do?

 Jack: Enclosed is a new draft of the Schedules marked against the previous draft. I believe that this draft responds to most of the issues raised in your e-mails.  Just a few additional thoughts:  1. Since we will be redoing all of the existing confirms to refer to this Master, I did not change the language that states that conflicts between the Confirms and the Agreement are resolved in favor of the Confirm.  I think that the language as written works.  2. On the setoff language, when we are the Non-Defaulting Party, we can only pull in other agreements between our affiliates and inland so I don't see how this language would impact any agreements between ENA and guaranty Bank unless Inland is the Non-Defaulting party.  3. With respect to Disruption Fallbacks, our view is that if the Confirm specifies a Fallback reference Price that after Postponement, you would use that price if available.  I think that the language works as drafted.  4. On cash collateral, the Qualified institution concept only applies when the non-posting party is a Defaulting party or has a Credit rating below the threshold.  Otherwise the non-posting party can hold the collateral and do whatever it wants to with it.  Your are correct that in practice this cash gets commingled with corporate funds and swept into the party's bank account but there is no requirement taht it work that way.  We look forward to having a call with your group next week.  Please e-mail me with some days and times so that I can alert our people.  thanks.

 Paul: Just a few questions for you on the revised EEI master that we received from Engage today:  1. I just want to confirm that the collateral thresholds should be 9 million.  2. They want to have Section 8.1(b) and 8.2(b) apply which requires a party to post collateral if the other party believes that its creditworthiness is unsatisfactory.  2. In our Schedule, we delete the 3 day cure period for an event of default that occurs as a result of a Guarantor's non-payment.  They want the cure period.  do you care?  3. In Section 5.7, each party can suspend performance if a Potential Event of Default or an Event of Default occurs. They want to delete Potential Event of Default.  4. They want to extend the right to dispute invoices and to request adjustments to statements or payments from 12 months to 18 months.  5. They want to change the consent to assignments standard from being able to withhold consent in one's sole discretion to being able to withhold consent only when it is reasonable to do so.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com

 Keith: I am okay with the arbitration and non-exclusive jurisdiction language as currently written as I understand that these concepts were previously agreed to between you and Mary.  Here is my understanding of the remaining open issues:  1. Whther termination is automatic or elective on bankruptcy.  You are considering our request to make it elective.  2. Loss vs. Market Quotation.  We are considering whther we can accept your proposed language.  3. Time period for posting collateral.  You are considering how long you need.  4. Cash collateral.    I am checking with our office in Canada about this.  5. MAC clause - you are considering whther this should be an Additional Termination Event with the ability to cure by posting collateral or an event that reduces the collateral threshold to zero.  6. Default rate definition -  Ed is considering what we can accept in lieu of the ISDA definition.  7. No Fault Termination - we are considering whether we can accept this.  8. Credit thresholds and Rounding amounts - you and Ed to discuss.  9. Acceptable LC Issuers - Ed to consider whther limiting it to US and Schedule 1Canadian banks with a certain credit rating is sufficient with language that the parties can agree to add foreign banks.  Let me know if I misstated and of the above issues.  Thanks.  Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Greg: We have another counterparty that wants to be able to post cash collateral. Has any progress been made in developing an alternative to this that we are comfortable with?  Carol St. Clair EB 3889 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com 
 Mr. Brown: At Laird's request, I am forwarding to you a draft if the ISDA and CSA Schedules.  We need more information from you concerning our counterparty such as exact legal name, type of entity, state/country of incorporation etc.  as apparently we could not tell from the financials what type of entity it is.  This may require some changes to the enclosed drafts, but nothing major.  We look forward to hearing from you after you have had a chance to review the enclosed drafts.

 Christian: I sent out the Schedules to Jeff Brown by e-mail and faxed him and Laird the preprinted ISDA and CSA.  Ed Sacks seems to think that they are a German company.  I have asked then for more information.  Laird is hot to get this "signed up" on Monday.  I am out on Monday but if necessary, Sara or Mary Cook can help you.  Marie Heard is the legal assistant.

 Tanya: Some of the people in your group may not be aware of the latest forms that we use for the Enron Guaranty, the Counterparty Guaranty and the letter of credit form that we use for the ISDA, Omnibus, Industrial Master and Deemed ISDA forms.  enclosed are those forms.  We will discuss them with the group tomorrow, but could you circulate them to the group?  Alos, in light of all of the counterparty visits taht are occurring, should we send to the group a form of confidentiality agreement taht they can send to the counterparty? The practice lately has been for us to see the counterparty form and our preference would be to use our form.  Let me know what you think. Carol 
 Jaime: I spoke with our counsel in Mexico today and they are beginning the process of analyzing the online issues for us.  I hope to be able to have a call with me, you and them sometime next week where we can answer whatever questions they have and maybe get a preliminary indication from them as to what our online issues may be.  Who from the online side should I involve?  Alos, are there any days next week in which you would not be available?  Could you alos e-mail me with your direct phone number and fax number?

I did talk to Mark Taylor and he agreed that we could do something to address your concerns and wanted to address what specific language we would be comfortable with when the next draft came and we had a chance to sit down with our online business person and go through it.  I look forward to receiving the next draft from you at which time we will come up with some language taht hopefully works for the both of us.

 Jaime: Just wanted to update you on the call that I had this morning with Jose and Pablo.  As a general matter, I think that we are going to be okay with offering physical and financial derivative products to Mexican counterparties online.  They are in the process of reviewing the online documents and will get back to me sometime next week with any thoughts or recommendations.  One area that we will need to be careful in is in how we market Enron Online for there are restrictions in connection with the offering of "securities". While it is fairly clear that commodity based derivatives are not securities there may be other products where it is not so clear cut.  I think that it would be very helpful if you would send to Jose and Pablo the Online materials (i.e, brochures etc.) that we would plan to send to prospective counterparties so that we can make sure that our marketing efforts don't violate any restrictions taht we would be subject to.

 Pablo and Jose: Thanks for the update.  Based on the marketing information that you received from us yesterday, are there any restrictions on our folks in Mexico going forward with their marketing efforts?  If so, please advise.  Prior to receiving you written advice, would it be possible to schedule a call maybe on Wednesday of next week with myself and Jaime so that we can at least outline any potential online issues, both in connection with our marketing efforts and in connection with the online documents that you are reviewing?

Please let me see the agreement as I think that if we go back to our non-arbitration language, there is other language that needs to be added. Carol

 Trina: Could you please make sure that Susan Bailey, a legal assistant in our group, gets copies of all of the Raptor docs so that we can keep a file in our group.

I just want to make sure that I don't have to go through Scott to get anthing if you know what I mean.    Susan's extension is 34737.

As it turns out, the Guarantor will be the counterparty on all financial trades so this Guaranty will only support physical deals done by Alberta's affiliates.

 Suzanne: If Bill gets his act together I will hand you an invitation to our party tomorrow, but here are the details:  Saturday, April 22, 5-7.

 Tana: Per my voice mail, Luannne Giessen's phone number is 212-902-0580. Carol 
 Jeff: I'm checking into this.  I don't think that we need to amend the ISDA Master because of the language that we put in our confirms, but I will get back to you on this shortly. Carol 
 Jeff: No amendments are necessary for you to do weather trades. Carolea 
 Brant Per our discussions, here is what the Oneok folks want to do.   1. We currently have 2 Masters - one with KN Marketing LP (now known as Oneok Energy Marketing & Trading Company, LP) and one with Oneok Gas Marketing Company.  Pursuant to the Guaranty that you just received, both Masters are currently guaranteed by Oneok Inc.  In addition, both Masters are currently guaranteed by Enron Corp. under a $15,000,000 Guaranty for Onoek Gas and a $10, 000,000 Guaranty for KN.  2. The Oneok folks want Oneok Gas Marketing to assign all trades and its Master to KN Marketing LP and to terminate the KN Marketing LP Master.  When all is said and done, there will be one Master with KN Marketing LP and all trading activity will be with this entity.  As I mentioned to you, the Master that will remain in place has no Credit Support Annex.  How much should the Enron Guaranty be for?   Call me if you have any questions.  Susan, Could you please prepare an assignment and Termination Agreement for this. Brant will let us know if any amendments need to be made to the Oneok Master.  Carol

 Andrea: We are having our credit lunch tomoorow from 11:30 to 1:30 in 30C1.  You are more than welcome to attend. Carol 
 Elizabeth and Leslie: I received a call from UtiliCorp's counsel yesterday and he was asking questions about how we would structure an option with respect to power.  He was describing an financial  option that could be settled physically and was wondering who the counterparty on our side would be.  Would or can we do such an option and if so, would ENA or EPMI be the counterparty? Carol 
 Paul Henry on the weather desk informed me that they have agreed with one of our counterparties to terminate a deal.  I've asked for a copy of the confirm.  Could one of you please e-mail to me this morning a form of dela termination letter that we can send to the counterparty?  Thanks. Carol

 I have asked Taffy to schedule an interview with the above candidate from 10:30 -11:30 on Monday.  Sara and I spoke with her today and think that it is apprpritae to have her come back to met you.  Plesae let Taffy know ASAP if you cannot attend.  Hopefully we can make a decision next week. Carol 
 David: Are you okay with this? Carol 
 David: GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA:  1.  In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.  Also, in the second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the Website password?]  2. They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a similar indemnity.   I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1?  Carol 
 Richard: Do you have any thoughts on this? Carol 
 Susan: Plaese set up a call next week with their legal and credut people to discuss their comments.  Please include Rod Nelson and Jason Peters on our side. Taffy has access to my schedule. Thanks.  Carol 
 Rod: The following are the credit issues that they raised in their comments:  1. Cross default threshold - instead of $100,000,000 they want a 3% of equity test.  2. Credit Event Upon Merger - they want to delete the amendment language in our Schedule  3. MAC Trigger - this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make it a Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a Baa3 rating by Moody's.  4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank regulatory authorities  5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option transactions.  6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation of an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event Upon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to "matured and unmatured" obligations.  7. They don't want a cap on the Enron Guaranty  8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that have an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method works.  I'm still trying to understand what this language does but it appears to qualify any payments on termination that the Non-Defaulting Party would have to make to the Defaulting Party.  I will send you a copy of their comments and hopefully we will talk to them about this next week.  carol 
 Stacy: I left on your chair the commnets to the amendment agreements.  Could you please confirm with Lisa that it makes sense to have the additional bankruptcy termination enevts as "automatic" triggers in your document when in the fianncial master it is drafted as an election.  Please e-mail the revised agreement to KCS' counsel - Zachary May and copy Harry Stout. Zachary's e-mail is zachary.may@weil.com and Harry Stout's is hls@KCSEnergy.com.  Thanks and call me if you have any questions. Carol 
 Rhett: We are in the process of negotiating an ISDA with this counterparty which is a German Bank and is not a Multibranch Party.  We just received their comments to our ISDA Schedule and they raised the following tax issues:  1. They have deleted the Section 3(f) rep in our Schedule and inserted "none".  2. In our tax forms section, they have deleted our language and added language that only requires them to give to us a Form 4224 in connection with payments received by them under the ISDA that are attributable to the conduct of a business in the US.  3. They have modified the definition of "Indemnifiable Tax" to include taxes imposed as a result of a Change in Tax Law by an authority in the jurisdiction of the payee, unless the payor is located in such jurisdiction .  I will send you their mark-up but I need your advice on how to handle these comments.  Thanks. Carol 
 Shari: Do you know if Ed Straub is looking into this matter with respect to Duke Energy marketing Ltd. Partnership. Carol 
 Sara: I met with David Dupre to discuss issues relating to unsigned confirms and apparently Williams is one of our biggest offenders.  Do you know why they are not signing?  Also, are we planning on talking about this next Friday? Carol 
 Russell: Our confirms desk has informed me that Aquila Risk Management has not been executing confirmations that are sent to them and apparently the reason for this was that they ere waiting for the Utilicorp Master to be put in place. Now that we have completed the Master, is there some way that we can get these confirms executed?  I will send you a list of deals shortly, but I'm assuming that given the language that we have in the Master that there should be no problem in signing the existing confirms that reference the existing Aquila Master.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 David: As a follow up from last week, are you okay with giving Cinnergy and Duke energy termination rights? Carol 
 Jeff: Were the following points considered or discussed prior to them turning the last draft?  The cross default langugae still does not work.  Why was the threshold lowered to $50,000,000?  Alicia: What are your thoughts on this?  Carol 
 Mr. Stout: I understand from your e-mail to Lisa Mellencamp that Zachary May is out of the office.  I am helping Lisa out on this matter as an attorney in our financial derivatives group.  In addition, Stacy Dickson is handling all matters relating to physical trades that have been done between Enron and KCS.  In addition to the pleadings, we are also preparing amendments to both the physical and financial agreements taht currently exist between the companies.  Last week, I sent to Zachary May a draft of an amendment to the financial master between Enron North America Corp. and KCS Energy Marketing. Stacy Dickson will be sending you a revised draft of that document that adds to it the amendments that we need to make to the physical agreements between the companies which consist of 4 separate agreements.  These amendments need to be attached to the court pleadings and approved by the court.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-3989.  Carol 
 Sara: Thanks for your voice mail message.  David Dupre and I have not done all that much to date.  He is in the process of compiling information for all counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.  I have asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.  I think that the main issues to cover on Friday involve:  1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to whether NY or Texas law applies.  2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties. For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree with the terms of such deals.  I'll have David D. send up a sample.  3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.  I'm available anytime to talk about the above.  Carol

 Joe: I need your help regarding the above counterparties  As you probably know, at the holding company level, BT and Deutsche merged so that now bankers Trust is a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG.  ENA has a Master with BT and we are negotiating one with Deutsche.  Their attorney informed me today that it was his understanding that all new trades should be confirmed with Deutsche Bank.  Here is what I need to know:  1. The date of the last trade that we confirmed with BT.  2. The date of the first trade that we have confirmed with Deutsche.  3. A copy of the Deutsche confirm that we are being sent.   Thanks for your help.   Carol 
 Jeff: Alicia and I will get back to you with a mark-up with our thoughts on this since some of the langugae appears to be different from what is in the Revolver.  Alicia thought that maybe this langugae came from Condor.  My objective here is to make sure that there is some good precedent for this language and that this deal does not create a new standard. Carol 
 Sheri: Our swaps group meeting is at 10 on Wednesday so I cannot make the second half of the Training Session.  Could you please coordinate with Suzanne on another time?  Again, I just need to take the second part of the class. thanks. carol 
 Rod and Brant: I finally received their revised draft of the Schedules.  They are still insisting on an Additional Termination Event that gets triggered if there is a MAC.  As defined, MAC means a rating that is below BBB- OR Baa3 or failure to have a rating from either S&P OR Moody's.  I need your guidance on this. MAC as defined in the CSA  which triggers the threshold going to zero works the same way.  I seem to recall that from a credit standpoint, we were okay with a MAC that would be triggered if either rating fell.  Is that correct?  Carol 
 Rob: Thanks for your redraft.  I'm checking with my credit folks on the MAC termination event.  As soon as I hear from them, I will send you my comments and we can discuss any remaining open items but I think that we are close.  Carol 
 Rod: These are the issues  taht we need to talk about before our call on Wednesday afternoon. Carol 
 Linda: Here is what Stacy requested. Carol 
 Sara: Per my voice mail. carol 
 Sara: I spoke with Mark about this and he was all in favor of having a party for Marie although I got the feeling that if we wait on him to organize it it won't happen.  Anyway, would you consider having a get together at your house?  We were just going to limit it to the swap group.  Let me know what you think.  Carol 
 Russell: Since late 1998, we have been trying to put in place a Master between ENA and the above counterparty.  We currently have a Master dated July 1997 between ECC and Pancanadian Petroleum Limited and Pancanadian wants to pretty much duplicate this Master.  Here are the credit terms of the late 1998 drfat that we sent them which I need for you to tell me are still okay:   No Credit Support Providers Cross Default - $50,000,000 for ENA and $25,000,000 for them Additional Event of Default - occurrence of a MAC and the failure to provide Perfprmance Assurance in accordnace with annex A.  MAC is defined as Enron's rating going below BBB- and their Net Worth falling below $133,000,000 opr their Funded Debt to Net Worth being more than 1 to 1 They want to defined the "control" concept in Affiliate as ownership of more than 50% of equity.  This term is used in the Setoff language and limits the possible  entities that could be Affiliates on our side and their side Forms of collateral are cash and LC's Collateral Thresholds are $10,000,000 for us and $3,500,000 for them  Let me know what you think.  Carol 
 Bill: This looks fine to me. Carol 
 Stacy or Jeff: Could you please verify that Frank's answers to the physical questions are correct?  Thanks. acrol 
 Frank: I have sent your responses to Stacy Dickson and Jeff Hodge so that they can verify the physical questions.  With respect to question #3, I would alos state that until the Master is executed, all of those trades will be governed by the online GTC.  Also, to the extent that Cargill traded with Enron Canada on a financial basis, those trades would alos be confirmed under the Master as it is my understanding taht we do not do separate Masters with the same counterparty for ENA and ECC.  Carol 
 Rod: I found my file and here is where things stand:  1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at $100,000.  2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days after quarter end.  3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.  4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:  Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.  Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all proper income charges, including taxes on income.  Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products.  Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these definitions?  5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000.  This is all that I have.  Let me know what you think.  Carol 
 Russell: I will call you later.  Could you please e-mail to me the credit worksheet? Carol 
 Frank: Stacy Dickson has confirmed that your answers with repsect to "physical" are correct. Carol 
 Susan: Please send me a revised chart. Carol 
 Mark: Could you please take a quick look at this too and let me know if  you have any comments?  I'm at 33989.  Thanks. Carol 
 Jason: Could you help me review this?  I thought that given your review of some of the other agreements that you might have some helpful suggestions about what to look out for from our standpoint.  I have sent a copy of this to Mark Holsworth.  Thanks.  If we need to sit down with Mark Tawney and ask him questions about what this should cover, let me know. carol 
 Susan: I'm not sure that what I told you to do in the CSA Annex with respect to Custodians and their qualifications work so for now let's keep it out and go back to our old language.  Sara and Mark: Shari had a counterparty point out to her that in our CSA Annex language where we talk about the circumstances under which a party can "hold" collateral, all of our triggers are based on something happening to our counterparty and nothing is said about what would happen if a Custodian holds the colateral and fails to be creditworthy.  Do you have any thoughts on this?  At first I thought that we should require the Custodian to be a Qualified institution but I'm not sure that that is the right approach.  Let me know what you think. Carol 
 Rob: I am faxing to you our comments to the latest drafts of Schedules.  Our credit person has agreed to make the MAC trigger as an additional Termination Event so long as (1) we limit the trigger to the S&P rating; (2) we provide a cure concept that the non-Affected Party controls subject to a cap; and (3) we remove the MAC trigger from the collateral threshold definition.  I have included some proposed language.  Also, with respect to the partnership agreement, I seem to recall that you were reluctant to send us a copy as we traditionally review LP agreements as a part of our due diligence.  Is that still the case?  I like what you did on the Termination Event but we need some comfort that you cannot alter or narrow the GP's liability that is provided by statute.  Could you please give that some thought and we can talk further about it?  Tomorrow is bad for me to talk but the rest of the week after tomorrow looks good if you have some time. Carol 
 Shari: I am negotiating an ISDA with Dresdner Bank and I have the following questions concerning their mark-up of the FX/Currency Option language:  1. In the EMU Protocol language they want to add a reference to Section 6. I'm not sure why but wanted your thoughts on this.  Are there any circumstances under which we do not adopt the Protocol provisions?  2. They want to define the FX Definitions as the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions as amended and supplemented by the 1998 ISDA Euro Definitions. Is this okay?  What is the effect of this?  Should we change our form to do this?  With respect generally to the FX and Currency Option Definitions, as a general rule are they always incorporated by reference into the terms of any FX and Currency Option transaction even if it is electronically confirmed? They wanted to add language to that section of our form specifically stating this.  Thanks in advance for your help.  Carol 
 Nedre: Per your request, here is what we have decided:  1. Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.  As I mentioned to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to her.  2. We have passed on the following candidates:  Stephanie Panus Patricia Slaughter Donald Duhon Debra Vincent   Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.  It would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send their resume elsewhere.  Also, do you have references for Samantha?  Please call me if you need any additional information.   Carol 
 Shari:  I need your thoughts on 2 things:  We have done another trade with this counterparty on the Omnibus form and Jaryd informed me that as part of the first trade, we agreed to some modifications to our Annex A.  Do you remember what those modifications were?  Also, we are now using our new form of Annex A.  How do you think that this counterparty will react to getting a new form?  I loook forward to hearing from you.  Carol 
 Nedre: To the extent that she gives us references from her current employer (and I hope that she will) can one of us talk to them as well? Carol 
 Russell: Just wanted to confirm that what you said in your e-mail overrides what is in the credit worksheet as some of the numbers were different.  Please advise. Carol 
 Russell: Here is what their letter should say to us:  Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998 from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. ("Guarantor") for the benefit of Enron North America Corp. ("Enron").  By letter addressed to you dated April 6, 2000 (the "Termination Letter"), Guarantor terminated its obligations under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 6 to read as follows:  "This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date being the "Termination Date") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the terms of this Guaranty."  Please acknowledge your acceptance of the terms of this letter, by signing in the space provided below. 
 Derek: Could you call me sometime this week so that we can discuss how to proceed with your counterparties on the Annex A mail-out?  Thanks. Carol

 Jason: Tomorrow or Thursday would be fine. Carol  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Mark: Could you please answer Mark's question?  Alos, Jason Peters and I are still looking at this and we will call you with any further comments that we have. Carol  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Steve: Here is what I have found out from our credit and confirms people.  We are still confirming all trades with BT.  Further, when our credit person spoke with yours, they indicated that this would continue until a Master with DB is put in place.  Is all of this consistent with what you have heard?   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 John: I was reviewing an amendment that Susan bailey was working on concerning the ISDA Master between ECC and Petro Canada and wanted to make sure that you were comfortable leaving as is the following provisions that are in the Schedules:  1. They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness.  I'm not sure I understand  why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of the language and wanted your thoughts on this.  Alos, does the second part of the language need to be updated or revised in any manner?  2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger.  3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of Default trigger.  Should we specify a threshold?  4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual ratings triggers.  For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this additional Termination Event?   I don;'t think the cure language works and I don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger for that to go to zero is something else.  5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger.  6. In the CSA, we have permitted cash and government securities which I think is problematic given our general rule in Canada that we only take LC's.  7. There is a Minimum Transfer Amount of $500,000.  Please call me when convenient to discuss further.  Carol        Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Michael: I thought that you should be aware of this Transfer Agreement since it involves EEL.  Mark Holsworth has reviewed it and I am taking a look at it. If you have any thoughts or questions, please call me.  Hope all is going well with you and the group. Carol 
 Mark: I would like to see a draft of the License Agreement before we enter into the Transfer Agreement.  Alos, please ask them to send on Exhibits A through C for our review.  As a precaution, since this involves EEL, I have sent this to Michael Brown, my counterpart in London so he is aware of this.  He may have some comments.  Carol    Mark Tawney 05/09/2000 06:31 PM 
 Mark: Can you give me a sense of when you think Margaux will close?  The only reason I'm asking is because I will be taking maternity leave at some point in time in the next 2-21/2 months and I want to make sure that if necessary, I get someone else involved.  Hope all is going well. Carol 
 Mr. Stout: I just spoke with Stacy Dickson and she will be sending you by e-mail the final drafts of the 2 amendment agreements that we have prepared.  Please disregard what you have reviously received.  Sorry for any confusion that this may have caused. Carol

 Mary: I'm waiting for Dave Forester to okay this but I have spoken with Matt Goering here a few times about this and I believe he has been in contact with Pruett.  I will give Pruett a call and let him know where things stand but until I hear from Dave, I can't do anything. carol    Mary Griff Gray 05/10/2000 09:28 AM 
 Joyce: I am working on the ETA amendment letter which I hope to send to you shortly.  We have a new procedure here where every amendment needs to be signed off by the head of the Online group so I need to get their blessing before I send it on to you.

 Mark: Enclosed is a revised draft of the Domain Transfer Agreement with my comments and questions inserted.  Please call when convenient to discuss.  Have you heard from Mark Palmer yet?  Alos, Mark Haedicke asked me to let John Lavorato know that we were entering into this Agreement and I will leave him with a voice mail today. Carol    Michael: Do you have any comments?  Also, are you okay with NY law and should we add an arbitration provision? 
 Susan and Susan: Could someone make sure that you check Marie's chair this week while she is gone for anything that needs to be acted on before she gets back?  Thanks. Carol 
 Scott: Mark Holsworth suggested that I send this draft Agreement to you which provides for Enron's transfer of the domain name weather-desk.com.  I am particular concerned about our ability to make the reps in Section 3.  What I am sending you reflects our comments to the other party's draft.  I look forward to hearing from you.

 David: Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Mark: This is the e-mail where DF objected to my proposed termination rights language that I would like to talk to you about so that we can come up with some language that I can use for those parties whom we have agreed have the right to terminate.  Could you please stop by when you have some time? Carol 
 Taffy: Could you please schedule a meeting for next week for our entire group (including Jason Peters) for 11/2 hours to go over changes that need to be made to our forms?  It might be nice given the amount of time to schedule around the lunch hour and order lunch.  Thanks.  Carol 
 Michael: John Lavorato asked that this matter be brought to the attention of John Sherriff.  Can you do this for me? Carol 
 Adele: I just faxed to you our final comments.  One open issue on our side was the amount of your Guaranty and our credit person has requested $15,000,000.  If the credit people need to talk about this, Tanya Rohauer's number is 713-853-3263.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 David: I would prefer to wait until next Tuesday to meet, particularly in light of the luncheon with your group that we are having.  Is that okay with you?  In the meantime, I am working with credit to finalize the SG Interests Master and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken with them about confirmation issues.  Do we have a contact there?  I also have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Veronica: You don't need to copy me on these so long as you copy all of the legal assistants.  Theyw ill make sure that either Sara or I review what they draft. Carol 
 Does anyone know why in our form of LC we have language that seems to qualify Section 13(b) of the UCP which sets forth the amount of time that the issuing bank has to honor drafts?  I don't see anywhere in our form where we modify this Section.  Here ios the current version that we are using. Carol 
 Shari: Any thoughts on this? Carol 
 Tana: Here is the Enron Guaranty .  It is in my specproj/J Aron file named as Enron Guaranty FINAl.  Carol 
 Bill and Tanya: Enclosed is a list of "follow-up" items that we came up with based on what we talked about last Friday.  Maybe some of these can be discussed at our next group meeting next week so that we are clear on who is handling which issue. Feel free to send me any thoughts you may have on these issues.  We really appreciate the enthusiasm that your group has for these seminars and look forward to doing more of them in the future. Carol

 John: As we discussed, here is a draft of a proposed amendment letter which covers the issues that we talked about.  Depending upon how Leslie handles the affiliate issue, more may be added to this.  Alos, as I ,mentioned to you, this needs to be approved by the head of our Online group before I can sign off on it.  I am in the process o getting that approval. Carol

I would like to have all of these ready and executed by this time next week.  I will send you the Enron Guaranty after it has been finalized.  Thanks.  Call if you have any questions.  My contacts there are Adele Raspe and Maria Salvatore, her legal assistant. Carol 
 Susan: I would like to talk to you briefly next week sometime about what in your opinion would be the best way to train the new legal assistant that we plan to hire.  In particular, could you give some thought as to what worked the best for you and what didn't work.   I will keep whatever you say confidential.  I also have discussed with Mark that I want you to play a significant role in the training process given the outstanding progress that you have made in the last year.  Could you also give that some thought and let me know what you think?  Thanks. Carol 
 Shari: This looks fine to me. Carol    Shari Stack 05/12/2000 10:09 AM 
 David: Thanks.  I have left a message with Tanya at Merrill.  If they insist on making their change, I have some suggested language for them that will make it work. Carol    David P Dupre 05/12/2000 08:11 AM 
 Alicia and Trina: Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the swap docs:  Put Confirm  1. Looks like some type of price protection mechanism is contemplated in the Master Derivatives Agreement and I'm assuming it would go into this confirm 2. In the definitions of ISDA and Equity Definitions, please add amendments and supplements  Harrier/Talon Schedule  1. We need to discuss footnotes 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13 2. I think that the mechanics for putting up the LC that is described in the Additional Termination Event that was added as clause (iv) needs to be drafted somewhere to address, for example, drawing conditions, what happens when Enron's credit rating improves, the comment made in footnote 6 etc.  3. In Part 4, Section (a) and in all of the notice sections the notice that goes to the AGC of the Trading Group goes to Enron North America Corp. not Enron Corp. 4. In Part 5, Section (l)(Recording) please add after the word "parties" the phrase "in connection with the Transactions hereunder." 5. In Part 5, Section (o) (Confidentiality), is the class of permitted discloses in clause (iv) too broad?   Talon/Enron Schedule  1. In Part 1, Section (h) should a carve out from the definition of Identified Event be the new Termination Event that was added? 2. Why is Part 5, Section (n) in this Schedule? 3. Same comments as above  Master Derivatives Agreement  1. Is the defined term Net Premiums worded right for purposes of the $400,000,000 limitation?  For some reason, I'm thinking that a and b should be reversed.  Talon Note  1. In Section 3.2, I'm not sure that the reference in the second paragraph to Part 5(m)(i) of the Enron Schedule applies since the setoff rights only benefit Enron and its affiliates.  Also,  what does it mean to refer to the Enron Guaranty here?  Enron Guaranty  1. In Section 4, I think that it is fair for them to request that setoff only apply to the Guaranteed Agreements and unless I'm missing something, I think we can give on that point.  That's all that I have.  Have you discussed with Ben the point that we talked about last week concerning the difference between the calculation of "Net Talon Loss" versus "Loss"?   I'm available tomorrow to talk about these points. Carol 
 Susan: What is the status of this?  I would like to see a draft of the assignment and Termination Agreement soon.  Can you please prepare something for review sometime Monday?  Thanks. carol 
 David: I spoke with Tanya this morning and she is going to check with her people to see if this change really needs to be made. Carol    David P Dupre 05/12/2000 07:39 AM 
 Lisa: Per my voice mail, here is what I sent Frank.  Stacy Dickson has confirmed that all of the Physical answers are ok. Carol 
 Dave: 1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be.  2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided nature of the indemnity language.  Carol    David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 01:26 PM 
 Dave: Richard Sanders , our litigation manager, was okay with this since this just defines the location of the arbitration, not necessarily who gets selected. With respect to your second question, I will talk to Mark about it and get back to you. Carol    David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 01:16 PM 
 Adele: Tanya left a message for Cindy and offerred $10M as a cap for each Guaranty. The reason for the cushion is to protect the party who terminates at a time when its exposure is close to the credit threshold and by the time that the date is set and the amount is calculated there is a move in the market that results in its exposure being above the threshold. Carol 
 Dave: It's not specified that exactly.  The parties would have to agree on an exact site. Carol    David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 02:57 PM 
 Dave: I will take out omission and see what they say. Carol    David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 02:56 PM 
 Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Mark: Thanks for the update.  Monday is bad for me but TRuesday morning looks good if you could give me a call. Carol    Mark Evans 05/12/2000 03:44 AM 
 Scott: I will be there. Carol 
 I have a doctors appt Monday morning and will be in late in the morning.  Carol 
 Susan: Has this Master been executed?  I forgot what we specified as the effective date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective date of our Master.  Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks. Thanks. Carol 
 Brant: Their lawyer finally called me.  We have a few open credit issues on our side that I need for you to think about:   1. Are you okay with the cross default threshold on both sides being 3% of stockholders' equity?  They didn't like $100,000,000.  2. For corporate policy reasons, they cannot take advantage of affiliate setoff.  Since I wasn't sure what relationships ENA and its affiliates had with this counterparty, I wasn't sure how strongly you felt about it.  Please advise.  Carol 
 Karen: Please take a look at what we have agreed to in Section 4(b) of the amendment.  Your new language does not track that language and if you are going to add language to the LC it needs to track that language.  I personally feel that this language is unnecessary so long as the drawing condition is specified. Carol    "Karen Ector" <karen_ector@transcanada.com> 05/12/2000 04:42 PM 
 John: Our credit person has agreed to the 3% equity test for cross-default.  With respect to setoff, given our relationships with El Paso, this is an important credit point for us and one that I guess the credit people will need to discuss since it is important for us to have the Affiliate language.  Our credit person is Brant Reves (713-853-9897). Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Russell: Please see the e-mails that Susan and I have exchanged.  Since we are still confirming deals under ARMS, does the effective date on the Transfer and Termination Agreement work?  I want to make sure that it covers all trades that have been confirmed with ARMS until we start confirming with Utilicorp. Please advise. Carol  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Rob: On the recording language issue, we can agree to the following:  Instead of limiting it to trading, marketing and scheduling personnel, we can agree that it is limited to all telephone communications that are made to or from each party's trading floor. This is because all calls that originate out of our trading area are always recorded no matter who picks up on the other line. Does that work for you?  I'm still checking on the confirmation/transaction tape issue.  Also, our credit person will agree to the Moody's trigger in the MAC language that we discussed.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Susan and John: We have finalized the amendment with Transcanada.  What we executed before still works.  We modified slightly the LC form.  They are faxing me their form of Guaranty and will send to Susan the docs.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Rob: We can accept your comment regarding resolving conflicts between executed confirms and Transaction Tapes.  Would you consider extending this to those confirms that are "deemed" executed as a result of a failure to respond within the period set forth in that section?  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 David: Thanks for your e-mail.  With respect to one of your points, we have in the past agreed to modify Section 4(b) of the ETA by adding the following at the end:  "unless such access, entry, omission or action arises from acts or omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or contrcators.''  Alos, with respect to the Deemed ISDA issue, for ENA or ECC trades, we do not consider the Deemed ISDA to constitute a "Master Agreement" and our deemed ISDA counterparties are required to accept the GTC's before trading.  Are the rules different in Australia? Carol 
 Dave: I spoke with Mark about the Federal law issue and we both feel that our exposure is no greater than what it would be if we traded over the phone with this counterparty.  Because they are a federal agency, there is no way around this issue other than to not permit them to trade with us online. Carol     David Forster@ENRON 05/12/2000 01:16 PM 
 Karen: The Guaranty looks fine.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Mark: That works for me. Carol    Mark Evans 05/15/2000 04:09 AM 
 Mary: A draft of the amendment letter to the ETA was sent by fax today to John Puett. Carol 
 John: Please disregard my earlier fax.  Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter. Carol St. Clair (713-853-3989) 
 John: The head of our Online group reviewed the letter that I sent to you last week and requested one change.  Enclosed is a marked and clean version of the ETA amendment letter which addresses all of the issues that we discussed and may need to be revised further to address the issues that you discussed with Leslie Hansen.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Joyce: Enclosed is a draft of the ETA Amendment Letter.  Sorry that this took so long.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Jim: At long last, enclosed is a draft of the ETA Amendment Letter that addresses the termination issue.  Since the last draft, we have had new procedures in place that require all amendments to be approved by the head of our Online group.  This review process resulted in several chnages to the draft that I previously sent you, namely:  1. We cannot agree in Section 3(e) to change the word "may" to "shall", due in part to the fact that we are looking into doing paperless trades online.  2. In the amendment to section 4(b), he has asked that we delete any reference to omissions.  I apologize for this.  Please call me after you have had a chance to review this.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Taffy: I am planning on attending an offsite seminar on June 2nd from 8-12.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    Taffy Milligan 05/15/2000 11:35 AM 
 Marie: I would like to fax and mail out the Annex A letters to the new counterparties to make sure that they all get them.  My secretary is available to help with the mail out which I would hope could be sent out no later than the end of the day Thursday given that we are going to be away.  I will let her know that you may be asking her to help.  I would alos want someone while we are gone to check all of the return faxes against our list so that they all go out to the right numbers.  Stop by if any of this is not do-able   Tahnks.  Carol 
 Adele: This looks fine to me.  I look forward to receiving your drafts. carol 
 Adele: I understand from my credit person that the new Guaranty caps will be set at $8,500,000.  I look forward to receiving from you the final drafts.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Peter: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the following:  "It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."  Our current rep is attached.  Is this something that we can agree to? Carol 
 Sara: When ENA enters into an ISDA Master with a Canadian counterparty, is that counterparty expected to make the ESP and Options rep?  Does ENA make the Canadian Securities Act rep?  Carol 
 Susan: Could you please follow-up with Russell Martinson before our credit meeting tomorrow and see where things stand?  As I indicated ion my e-mail to him, we need to make sure that the effective date for the Transfer Agreement is dated so that all ARMS deals are covered.  Thanks. Carol 
 Trina and Alicia: Do you know who is commenting on the Enron reps and warranties mentioned in the cover memo either from your side or our side?  Also, Mark Evans is calling me tomorrow at 10 to go over the "New" structure.  Let me know if you want to be plugged in.  I'm not sure if the swap docs are affected.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Scott: I have been monitoring drafts of the swap docs.  Are you or someone else in your group reviewing the other docs that involve Enron Corp. such as the Certificate Purchase Agreement that appears to have a bunch of reps that Enron has to make?  I( have not been paying to much attention to the docs that don't involver the swap. Carol 
 Michael: Our guys are meeting with Risk Management Solutions tomorrow morning.  Scott Brown of V&E and I will be talking to them about the Agreement this afternoon.  Have you heard anything back from John Sherriff? Carol 
 Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Adele: Please see the enclosed draft opinion.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Adele and Maria: The date of the earliest outstanding trade is 11/29/99 so that is what I think we should date the docs.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Lucy: We thought that it would be a good idea to meet with the "weather" group to introduce ourselves and alos to go over some of the basics, such as procedures for getting confidentiality agreements processed etc.  Could you send me a list of who you think we should include in this meeting and Sara and I will do the rest?  Will a lunch work? Carol 
 Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Susan: Please update me on this.  I realize you've been busy on other matters but please carve out some time to complete this so we can put this behind us. Thanks. Carol 
 Rod: Are you ready to talk about the outstanding Deutsche Bank issues that I e-mailed to you and is there any update on SG Interests? carol 
 Jeff: Now that Principal Subs has been taken out of the cross default provision, is there any need to refer to Subsidiaries in the definitions of Debt  or Permitted Receivables Purchase Facility ?    Carol St. Clair 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Rob: I'm checking with my credit person about your deletion of our amendment to the Specified Transaction cross default and then I will call you with my remaining comments.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Robert J. Rieth" <rjr@houston.rr.com> 05/16/2000 10:03 AM 
 Suzanne: I'm pretty flexible.  The only days that appear to be bad if its done during lunch would be Friday, June 2 and Friday, June 16th.  As for ideas, I have NOTHING right now, but i know that Julia has some used stuff that she is going to give me.  We are planning on buying the furniture before the end of May.  As for the rest, I really hope to have all of that bought before the middle of June just in case. Carol    Suzanne Adams 05/16/2000 10:26 AM 
 Nora: You may want to let the folks at Milbank and V&E know to send you stuff instead of Scott.  My contacts in Houston from V&E are Trina and Alicia and in London is Jeff Eldredge.  Mark Evans is my internal legal contact in London. Carol 
 Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Susan: Please e-mail to Rob Rieth the information he needs to complete Part 5, Section (n) of the ISDA Schedule (wire transfer info).  Rob, With respect to Paragraph 13 (n) of the CSA Schedule, I think that we have already dealt with that in Paragraph 13 (l).  Carol 
 Mark and Taffy: I went ahead and registered for this and another class (ENA Orientation) to save a spot for Samantha.  We have until June 8th to cancel. Carol 
 Suzanne: We are going to try and schedule some more lunch meetings before I go on leave.  I would like to do one in early May, one in late May and one in JUne.  Could you please check the availability of  the conference room on 30 that we used last time and let me know what dates are open? Thanks. Carol 
 Mark and Taffy: Per my earlier e-mail, here is the other class that I registered for. Carol 
 Suzanne: Please make sure that you log in and select the people that should review you. Thanks. Carol 
 Maria: Could you please send me a redline of the Guaranty Agreements and LC (either by fax or e-mail) that crosses through and/or underlines the changes that were made?  Also, please send me a redline (either by fax or e-mail) of both the CSA (when it is ready) and ISDA Schedules that underlines or crosses through the changes that were made so that I can sign off on this.  The fax that I received did not indicate all chnages that were made in this way. Thanks.  Carol 
 Susan: Please give me a copy of the Transfer Agreement and I will respond. Carol 
 Russell: Thanks for your message.  I will take a look at the Transfer Agreement.  I just want to make sure that all trades done after May 3rd and before the execution date that are being confirmed under ARMS will be transferred to Utilicorp.  Alos, in order to change our online system, we need to know when the Utilicorp Master will be the operative document so that on and after such date, all deals are confirmed under the Master under the Utilicorp name.  Do you think that it would be better just to change the effective date of the Master and the Transfer Agreement to the date of Utilicorp's execution of the Master?   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Martinson, Russell" <RMartins@UtiliCorp.com> 05/16/2000 02:05 PM 
 Adele and Maria: Here are my final comments:  1. In the ISDA Schedule, Part 4, Section (f)(iii), we cannot accept a 30 day waiting period.  Why can't the Guaranty be furnished when the Reorg becomes effective?  2. In each Guaranty, there is an extra zero in the "cap" amount.  3. In the PSE&G Guaranty, the Counterparty notice section should be just like what is in the Master for primary notices and copies.  4. In the LC, in the new language on the second page, change Uniform Customs to UCP.  That's all I have.  Subject to resolving point #1, please e-mail to me the Enron Guaranty and please coordinate with Susan Flynn on getting final versions executed and obtaining other closing items.  I will review your opinion shortly.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Russell: That works for me. Carol    "Martinson, Russell" <RMartins@UtiliCorp.com> 05/16/2000 05:21 PM

 Rob: I'll do my best to get back to you tomorrow although I still have not heard from my credit person.  Other than the credit issue, I do want to talk to you about the following:  1. Deletion of the Termination Event in Section (j)(c).  If we have to choose between this and the covenant that you inserted in Part 5, I would much rather have this but I don't understand why we can't have both.  2. In the new language that you added in the "Recording" section, I don't think that I can agree to the reasonable expectation language unless we make it clear here that it would be reasonable to expect that any call that is made to or from our trading floor will be recorded.  Also, at the very beginning where it says "that originates from and" the word "and" needs to be "or" to cover the situation in our case where someone from your side that is not on the trading floor calls our trading floor.  3. In Part 5, Section (o) the last sentence, please change the word "herein" to "this Agreement" and please change the last reference to "the Existing Transactions" to "this Agreement" as I thought that this is what we agreed to.  4. In the definition of MAC, in clauses (a)(ii) and (b)(ii), please change the word "either" to "both" and the word "or" to "and", as I thought this is what we agreed to.  5. In the form of LC, our credit group has asked us to add language that amends Section 13(b) of the UCP to shorten the time frame from 7 to 3 days and I will fax that to you.  I will be tied up until late morning but otherwise available.  Carol    "Robert J. Rieth" <rjr@houston.rr.com> 05/16/2000 04:38 PM 
 Jeff: I don't but Trina may have an example of this.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Eldredge, Jeff" <jeldredge@velaw.com> 05/17/2000 05:24 AM 
 Susan: Please follow up with the following counterparties to see if we can get the Agreements executed:  Coral energy Louis Dreyfus KN Trading Sempra Statoil Vitol  I alos will give you a mark-up of the BOA Agreement which I would like for you to send back to them.  Thanks. 
 Suzanne: It will be our usual group and I don't think that we will n eed any conference call capabilities.  Carol    Suzanne Adams 05/17/2000 11:36 AM

 Brenda: Thanks for the update.  Please route any Alchem stuff to me. Carol    Brenda L Funk 05/17/2000 10:32 AM 
 Maria: Thanks for the message.  I'm confirming with credit that this language is acceptable but I think that it will be.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Salvatore, Maria" <Maria.Salvatore@pseg.com> 05/17/2000 09:52 AM 
 Maria: I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and probably the PSE&G Guaranty:  1. Change in the first paragraph "Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation to Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation and its successors and assigns  2. In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads :"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged between the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the "Agreement")  Let me know if you have a problem with this.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Susan: Here is the Guaranty. 
 I have a quick follow up appointment tomorrow at 2:15.  I should be back in the office around 3:00. 
 Rob: Susan Flynn tells me that the earliest outstanding trade is dated April 8, 1999 which is what I think the ISDA should be dated.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 John: I will send you my remaining comments shortly.  Here is a draft of the Enron Guaranty.  What have the credit people decided on with respect to a cap?    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Shuttee, John" <ShutteeJ@EPEnergy.com> 05/17/2000 03:05 PM 
 Brant: I need your help in answering the following questions:  EL PASO  Is the collateral threshold for both of us $50,000,000? What are the Guaranty caps? Is the cross default threshold now for both of us $100,000,000? Should cross default only apply to the Credit Support Providers or should it apply to the parties and their credit support providers?  OCCIDENTAL  Should we insist on our "affiliate" setoff language?  Carol 
 Fred: Here is what we sent to Harry Stout.  Lisa has been requesting from them a copy of the pleadings to make sure that all of our requested changes have been made and as of yesterday, I don't think that she had received anything. I will keep you posted on the status of these amendments.  Lisa is the best person to advise you on the status of the bankruptcy proceedings and the timing of getting an order signed so that you can commence trading. Carol 
 Russell: I have left repeated voice mail messages with Katie Flaherty, their attorney, and received no response.  I think that someone needs to make a commercial call so that we can resolve the issues raised in  my 4/28 letter. Carol 
 Dave: The above counterparty has requested the following changes to the ETA:  1. Make the reps in section 2(d) reciprocal  2. Make the assignment provision in Section 6(b) reciprocal  3. In Section 6(c), insert the word "its" between the words "all" and "third".  Please advise.  Carol  3. 
 Tana: Could you please talk to Anthony about the need for video conferencing as he mentioned something to Suzanne about needing that and let Suzanne know if we will be hooking anyone else in and if so, who and how?  Alos, does a total of 20 people (which includes our group) sound right to you?  Finally, what time do you want to start?  We have the room from 11:30 to 2?  Please let Suzanne know the above details.  Thanks.  Carol 
 Adele: Your opinion looks fine to me.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 David: I need a phone number and name for Williams.  I will follow up with Morgan as I have not heard back from them since I called them last week.  How is the chart coming? Carol    David P Dupre 05/17/2000 07:17 PM 
 Brant: Is this what was agreed to?  When we last spoke, it appeared as if you had not agreed to a collateral threshold of $50M and a cap of $55M.  Please advise. Carol 
 Steve: I have reviewed what you sent to Susan Bailey and it looks fine.  Please forward to Susan Bailey for execution after you have  had it executed at your shop.  Thanks.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Joe: We are entering into an Agreement with Puget Sound Energy, Inc. in which we are agreeing to some chnages to our new form of Annex A.  Enclosed is the new form which we have agreed to which should be attached to all trades done with Puget after February 2, 2000.  Alos enclosed is the Agreement that we will enter into.  Call me if you have any questions.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 David: Just wanted to let you know that Jason is doing a fantastic job helping us out!  He is eager and willing to do whatever we give him and a quick learner.  You made an excellent choice and we appreciate it.  Thanks.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 John: Please send Susan Flynn contact information for this counterparty so that we can send them our form of CA for the financial info that they intend to give us.  I'm assuming that this is in connection with swaps that we will be doing with them.  If there is anything else that we need to describe in the CA please let Susan know.  Thanks. 
 Rod: FYI. Carol 
 Mike: I am waiting for our credit person to respond to some questions that I had in compiling our comments.  As soon as i hear back from him, I will send you my comments by fax.  Please e-mail me with your fax number.  Thanks.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Theresa: I'm available before 1:45 and after 3:15. Carol  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    Teresa G Bushman 05/18/2000 10:30 AM 
 Brant: We are trying to finalize the agreement that does the following:  1. Transfers all of the ENA/Oneok Gas Marketing Company trades and the Oneok Gas Marketing Master from Onoek Gas Marketing Company to Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. (formerly KN Marketing LP); 2. Terminates the Oneok Energy Marketing Master and makes all Oneok Energy and Oneok Gas Marketing trades subject to the Onoek Gas Marketing Master.  Here is what I need to know from you:  1. Is there a new Oneok Inc. Guaranty for $30,000,000 that covers these trades?  If so, please fax me a copy.  2. Is there a new Enron Guaranty and if not, what happens to the 2 existing Enron Guarantees that currently support the Onoek Energy Master and the Oneok Gas Marketing Master?  Please advise.  Carol 
 Maria: Thanks.  I already did the Enron Guaranty yesterday and it is being signed hopefully today.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Salvatore, Maria" <Maria.Salvatore@pseg.com> 05/18/2000 12:08 PM 
 Susan: FYI.  Ignore the Enron Guaranty but make sure that the PSE&G Guaranty that you eventually get conforms to this. Carol 
 Joe: I think that Tana is right.  I guess that if we do a telephone trade and use the ECC Canada Annex A then we need to make the same modifications to that. Is that correct?  Have they requested any modifications to the online GTC?  Carol    Larry Joe Hunter 05/18/2000 12:14 PM 
 Leslie: Dave Forster must sign off on all ETA amendments that we do.  It may be a good idea for you to send him the new ETA amendment letter and walk him through the chnages that you have made to address your issues so that he understands what is going on.  If you want me to be involved in that conversation, I'm happy to participate.  Thanks. Carol    Leslie Hansen 05/18/2000 03:42 PM

 Susan: Could you please when you return on Monday circulate a list of issues that we need to discuss regarding the forms?  Susan Flynn was keeping track of some of those issues after you left.   I would like to try to get those issues addressed next week with the people that we need to talk to so that we can turn a draft of the ISDA Schedules, so please make this a priority.  Thanks.

 Pam: How are things with you?  I am doing great and feeling great!  I've got about another 8 weeks to go and I'm looking forward to getting this part over with.  I hope to work until pretty close to the end if my doctor lets me. Are you free for lunch anytime soon?  I would love to see you and catch up. E-mail me back with some good dates and hopefully we can get together.  Tell Patti I said hi.  Carol

 Mark: I just wanted to update you on where things stand currently with respect to the Domain Name Transfer Agreement that we are negotiating with Risk Management Solutions, Inc.  After visiting with Scott about the reps and warranties, he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and in particular, what in addition to the URL domain name (weather-desk.com) EEL was being asked to transfer and the restrictions that RMS wanted to place on EEL with respect to this Domain Name and "any variations thereof."   We went back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.  I'm not sure that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is to acquire from another third party the name "weatherdesk.com" , register it and use it with respect to the products that they offer.  All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names. We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead us to the right people that could.  It seems odd that we would be wiling to transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering these other names.  I look forward to hearing from you.

 Richard: In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with respect to the arbitration and process agent language:  1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be enforced in court?  2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language.  I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration issues and questions.  Carol 
 Greg: Can you help me answer this question?  Also, we have been through our ISDA forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters?  1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct?  2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?  Is this correct?  What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when ECC's counterparty is a US entity.  We look forward to hearing from you. Carol 
 Shari: Before I call their attorney about this I would like to talk with you briefly about the open issues and how negfotiations in the past have gone.  Please stop by.  I'll be tied up most of the afternoon until around 5 or so. Carol 
 Susan: I don't know if you were able to call these counterparties today but please follow up early next week with Coral, Dreyfus and Koch.  Thanks. Carol    Susan Flynn 05/18/2000 04:43 PM

 John and Molly: I have reviewed the ISDA Master that we have with Range Resources and here is a summary of the steps that need to be taken assuming that we have already notified them that they needed to post collateral:  1. An Event of Default occurs upon their failure to post collateral within 2 Business Days after notice of such failure is given to them by us.  2. Once an Event of Default occurs, then we can elect an early Termination Date.  The "Loss: method applies here.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, we need to coordinate closely with whoever will be doing the Loss calculation (and it should not be Fred or someone in his group) to make sure that they have the appropriate back up.  We would send a notice declaring an Early Termination Date once the Event of Default had occurred and then subsequently provide them with our calculation of the Termination Amount.  As I mentioned in my voice mail message, I need copies of all of the letters that we have sent to them along with copies of the confirmations of all outstanding trades.  All notices will need to be sent by federal express delivery such that they won't be effective until the day after they have been sent out.

 Tana: I have asked Suzanne to reserve the following dates for the big conference room on 30 for our upcoming lunch seminars:  Friday, May 5th, Thursday, May 25th and Friday, June 16th.  Sara and I are going to try and set something up with the weather group for the May 5th date if that works for them.  Can we plan on scheduleing something with the confirms group and the global contracts group for the other 2 dates?  Sara and I need to talk about what to do with the credit group.  Carol 
 Suzanne: Mary Cook's e-mail address at school is mcook@svdp-edu.org.  Pat Radford may have a different one for her home. Carol 
 Susan: I spoke with Utilicorp's contract person today and we have decided to do the following:  1. Leave the ISDA dated May 3, 2000 2. Change the Assignment Effective Date in the Transfer Agreement to whatever date we agree upon with Utilicorp.  Apparently, the ISDA has not been signed yet but will be by them in the next few days.  Until Russell comes back, they cannot sign the Transfer Agreement.  Could you please do the following this week:  1. Have the enclosed new form of Transfer Agreement signed and sent to Russell.  Leave the date on Page 1 blank. 2. Send to Russell the additional certificate that he is requesting attaching ENA's resolutions. Thanks.    Brant: How much lead time to we need to make the switch online?  Does Utilicorp have a password?  I'm hopeful that by sometime next week, they will sign the Transfer Agreement so that all trades could be confirmed under Utilicorp.

We alos left a voice mail message for Lou about getting outside counsel involved on the insurance/derivative issue.  Finally, do you have a list of proposed counterparties that you can send to us?  To the extent that approvals need to be obtained to trade with these counterparties, it may be a good idea to get that going. Carol    Gaurav Babbar 05/22/2000 02:05 PM

 John: I have finally heard back from my credit person on all of the credit points that I wanted him to confirm.  The only change that he raised was on the cross default where he said that the threshold was $100,000,000 for the Credit Support Providers and $10,000,000 for each party.    I will send you a new mark up on that.  Otherwise, everything else credit wise was as stated in your draft.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)

 Sandy: Susan Bailey passed on to me your comments to the ISDA draft and I can respond to some but not all of such comments at this point:  1. With respect to your Canadian securities rep, I am checking with our counsel in Canada about whether we can use your language instaed of ours.  2. With respect to the Options rep and the ESP rep in part %, Section (b), I believe that both parties need to make such reps.  The rep in Part 5 (b)(g)(ii) is to cover the Trade Option exemption and it is different from the ESP rep below it.  3. With respect to the language in Part 5, Section (a), this is different from the setoff language.    What this is saying is that if a party has fulfilled all of its payment obligations and an Event of Default occurs with respect to it (the "Defaulting Party"), the other party cannot withhold any payment that it owes to the Defaulting Party.  This is different from the exercise of setoff rights.  4. I would like to discuss with you or your legal representative the removal of the arbitration language as it is Enron's policy to have arbitration apply.  5. We would prefer to keep the Termination Currency specified in US Dollars.  6. Our tax group believes that we need the language in Part 3(a)(i), (ii). Why do you want to delete it?  I look forward to hearing from you.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) E-Mail Carol.St.Clair@enron.com

 Rhett: You may recall a few weeks ago I asked you about some language that one of our counterparties wanted as an amendment to the term "Indemnifiable Tax". Another counterparty, Deutsche Bank, has requested the following which I think is very similar to what we were looking at before:  Notwithstanding the foregoing, "IndemnifiableTax" also means any Tax imposed by reasons of a Change in Tax Law by a government or taxing authority of a Relevant Jurisdiction of the payer, unless the payee is incorporated, organized, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat in such jurisdiction, or is acting for purposes of this Agreement through a branch or office located in such jurisdiction.  In the ISDA Users' guide, they explain that the effect of this language is to eliminate the payee's risk of bearing new taxes imposed by the payer's jurisdiction even if the payee's activities in such jurisdiction is the basis for such taxes. (except if the circumstances in the definition occur).    It thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.  Do you think that we can or should accept this?

 Steve: I am faxing to you my response to your Guarnty comments.  While we are waiting on my credit person, would it be possible to get a redraft of the schgedules from you since a good portion of the comments that we discussed I beleieve we agreed to and would help me focus on what is left to discuss with my people?

 Mark, Jason and Sara:  Deutsche Bank has requested that we make various "Securities Act" reps in the ISDA Schedule in the event that we do equity derivatives.  These reps require us and them to say:  1. To the extent that a Transaction involves the purchase and sale of securities, it will not be registered and the securities cannot be sold except pursuant to a reg statement or exemption.  2. Each party is a QIB or an accredited investor.  3. Unless otherwise set forth in a Confirmation, any securities that a party is required to deliver shall not at the time of delivery constitute restricted securities or be subject to restrictions on transfer.  What do you think about this?  Carol

Also, we have changed our form of Guaranty since the prior one was entered into and I would prefer that you consider using the new form.

Could you please give this some thought and let Taffy know when you want to meet so she can get it set up?  Thanks. Carol

 Russell: I will draft something up later today for you  to look at.  With respect to Richardson Products, the July 29, 1999 Guaranty in the second paragraph already picks up all ECT affiliates which would include HPL, such that any physical contract between ECT or its affiliates and Richardson Products II, Ltd. would already be covered.  Their letter mentions an April 28th Guaranty.  Does one exist?  Why I don't think that we need to say anything with respect to the July 29th Guaranty, it certainly wouldn't hurt for them to simply send us a letter referencing this Guaranty and stating that it is their understanding that the term "ECT Affiliates" as used in the Guaranty  includes Houston Pipe Line Company.

 Tanya: Here is a summary of what has been agreed to with El Paso:  Cross Default Threshold - $100,000,000 for each of us.  They want this just to apply at the Credit Support provider level Guaranty Cap - $55,000,000 for each of us Collateral Threshold - $50,000,000; Rounding at $250,000.  No minimum transfer amount Setoff may possibly still be open re affiliates but I think that they will come around on this  Carol

At the end of the day, we both felt that this is a call that someone on the commercial side should make, such as either Ben Glisan or Mike Jakubik. Carol

 Susan: It's not clear to me what needs to be done on the file.  Has Paul contacted them about his note on 4/7?  If not, call Paul and find out if he wants you to make that call as that seems like the logical next step to take.  As far as their other comments, we cannot delete the Recording language on page 6 and in the Confirmation language let's offer up 5 Business days. Carol 
 Sara: Here is what CWT prepared for us some time ago. Carol 
 Russell: We have received excerpts from Global's LLC Agreement.  Its members are Global Petroleum Corp., YPF Distribution Company and Montello Oil Corporation.  It is managed by a Board of 3 reps selected by each member and for this purpose, Global and Montello are treated as 1 member and YPF is treated as 1 member.  I still need to talk to you about why we want an ownership change trigger in the ISDA and if we do, at what level. carol 
 Suzanne: I may be in tomorrow but I will leave you a voice mail message one way or another.  If I don't come in and I haven't used my discretionary day, please use that, otherwise treat it as a vacation day.  Hope you have a great weekend.  Be safe!  If it is slow tomorrow afternoon, I have no problem with you leaving around 4:30 or so. Carol 
 Suzanne: Please schedule the following meetings for either today or tomorrow:  Molly Harris - 45 minutes to talk about margin issues Richard Sanders and Sara - 30 minutes  - to talk about arbitration issues Rod Nelson 30 minutes - to talk about Idacorp and deutsche Bank issues (this one I would like to do today)  Thanks.  Carol 
 Jeff: I am assuming that someone on the Enron Corp. side has signed off on the new "jurisdiction" language that has now been inserted into the swap assignment and schedule as this language is a fairly radical change from what we had in there before.  Please confirm. Carol 
 John: Per ypur voice mail this is the lateset version of the ETA amendment letter without Leslie's chnages.  Please confirm that this part of it is opkay with you and your counsel.  Thanks.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Jeff: Thanks.  I think that a call would be a great idea.  Please let me know when. Carol 
 Sara: Sempra Energy Trading Corp. has requested that in lieu of them signing every single confirm that we send them that they sign periodically a statement that lists all of the outstanding deals where they acknowledge that they agree to the terms of such deals.  Do you see any problem with that? Carol 
 Russell: I spoke with the contact that you left me last week and she indicated that the ISDA had not yet been signed but that in all likelihood it would be signed in a few days.  I asked Susan bailey to send you the certificate with resolutions that you requested along with a new draft of the Transfer Agreement which has a blank for the date.  My thought was that everything would become effective on the date that we insert in the Transfer Agreement and I would ask that you coordinate with Susan bailey when you know what that date will be so that we can make sure that our systems reflect when the trades are to be confirmed under the Utilicorp Master.  Thanks.   Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Sandy: Thanks for all of your messages.  I will give the new mark-up of the ISDA Schedules to susan bailey and she will coordinate with you in getting it executed.

 Dave: Per my voice mail message, this entity would like to sign the same amendment letter that kinder Morgan signed which I have attached.  Please let me know if this is okay with you.  Thanks. 
 Jeff: Thanks for your message.  I would make sure that Nora and/or Scott are okay generally with the concept of submission to jurisdiction.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Eldredge, Jeff" <jeldredge@velaw.com> 05/30/2000 09:53 AM 
 David:  I don't want to meet until the report with all of the categories has been completed.  Just let me know when that is.  Again, the categories are as follows: -  # of unsigned confirms - total exposure of deals whose confirms have not been executed - # of deals with unsigned confirms whose term is in excess of 1 year - has the counterparty ever signed confirms? - reason for not signing confirms       David P Dupre 05/30/2000 10:28 AM 
 Leslie: FYI. Carol 
 Rob: Our credit person is okay incorporating the Specified Transaction concept without a threshold.    Please call me at your convenience to discuss the remaining open issues.  Thanks.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Taffy: Did HR confirm that everything had been worked out regarding Samantha?  Also, we need to do something with the remaining files in Marie's old office. Could you please coordinate this with Susan Flynn and Susan Bailey?  Thanks.  Carol 
 Brant: Is everything set up online for Utilicorp to trade? Carol    Brant Reves 05/30/2000 12:14 PM 
 David: The confirm that you sent me is a confirm with a different entity called Southern Company Energy Marketing, LP which is different from the above counterparty and is subject to an ISDA Master.    The company on the updated list that we received from Mary had a fax number of 205-257-5792 an ID # of 26428 and is located in Birmingham Alabama. Carol 
 Leslie: I would run everything passed Dave Forester since we need his approval on the amendment letter for your piece anyway and see what he says. Carol    Leslie Hansen 05/30/2000 01:11 PM 
 Brando: We already have a Master Agreement with Swiss Re in place so I don't understand why we would enter into another one with them to do online trades.  Please call me to discuss.  Also, Mark Tawney and Paul Henery had sent up for my review a form of ELRIX GA Participation Agreement which I had sent them comments and questions on.  Is that related to this?  It would be helpful to me if perhaps you, mark and i could meet so you could explain to me what we are trying to accomplish.  My assistant Suzanne Adams (37340) can help you set something up.  Carol  P.S.  The agreement that you sent to me refers to ELRIX Website Terms and Conditions and ELRIX Weather Derivatives Privacy Policy, both of which I need to see. 
 Pam: I can do June 12th, 13th or 15th. Carol    Pamela.Ewen@bakerbotts.com 05/30/2000 02:35 PM

 ...provided, that (1) on the next Succeeding Payment Date, the non-transferring party will not be required to gross up its payments to the proposed transferee or receive payments from the proposed transferee net of withholding or deduction that would not otherwise be required hereunder or under applicable law in the absence of such proposed transfer and (2) such transfer will not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default.

 Jason: Per my voice mail message here are some of the Swiss Re documents in the event that you can join me at 2 tomorrow. Carol 
 Jason: More docs. Carol 
 Steven : I have finally had a chance to go over the outstanding credit issues with Rod Nelson, our credit person, and here are his responses:  1. We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default provision.  We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and second-guessing and the language that you proposed does just that.  2. On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard for "materially weaker" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?  3. With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps). Is that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do more with netting across product lines.  4. In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days to resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of 1.  I am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules and will get back to you shortly on remaining comments.  Carol 
 Russell: Please see the enclosed letter 
 Sue: Sorry that I didn't get back to you over the weekend but with Arthur's baseball schedule and all the running around that we were trying to do, things were a bit hectic.  I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.  Things on the baby front are progressing well.  On our last ultrasound we got the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am still taking it easy and swimming alot.  The baby weighed about 4 pounds a few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.  Now I'm trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.  the people here at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch. Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few weeks.  I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time off but we will see how that goes.  I really feel great except for being uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is good practice for when the baby comes.  Arthur is doing great.  We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger pet!  They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.  He is still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!  He called dad practically every day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.  Arthur would  be on cloud nine if he came.  We'll see.  Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a week over the summer and we are looking into that.  I'm toying with the possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see how it works out.  I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby is born.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  You are obvious;y welcome at any time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in august.  Let me know what you think.  How is Cindy doing?  Do you know what she needs for her new addition?  Do you want to get her a joint gift?  Let me know.  I'm happy to do either something on my own or jointly with you.  How's Cate?  Give her my best.  What's new with you and your career situation?  I hope that you are enjoying what you are doing.  I certainly am and  I am still undecided about what I am going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the rest of the year off.  I've got to run to my "baby class" tonight.  Take care and I will try to catch up with you sometime.  I love you!  Carol 
 Joe: Per my voice mail message, here is a description of the online product that we are  looking to create. Carol 
 Scott and Bruce: I understand from talking to Jane this morning that we will be able to work with you as our counsel on the above transaction that we are working with ACE on.  My understanding from our commercial people is that we should be getting a redraft of the insurance policy sometime today with ACE which we will need your help in reviewing.  Leslie Hansen and I will be working on this from the legal end, with Leslie's focus being on the "power" issues and mine on the "derivative" issues.  As I mentioned to Scott last week, we will alos need your help in making sure that the derivative taht we draft is not construed to be insurance.  A draft of the confirmation taht we anticipate using will be sent out later this week.  In terms of timing, our goal is to be on-line by June 15th which will require us to try to get all documentation finalized as soon as possible.  I will keep you posted on any updates to our schedule.  Please feel free to call me or Leslie (713-853-6121) with any questions.  If there are others that we need to add to our distribution, please let me know.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) carol.st.clair@enron.com   Gaurav: Could you please add Bruce Wright to the Distribution List.  His number is 212-424-8620.  Please circulate to the Enron group, Bruce and Scott a Distribution List with the information for the Enron people that are involved.  Thanks. 
 Tanya: We still don't have it and we were hoping that someone on the commercial side would place a call to J Aron.  We agreed to it weeks ago and there is no reason why we shouldn't have it by now.  Since the existing Guaranty does not cover the new Master I do not consider the new Master to be effective. Apparently there is some confusion on J Aron's part since they keep referring to the new Master in their confirms.  I have left a message for their counsel, Luanne Giessen, that we do not consider the new Master effective until we receive the new Guaranty.  Tana has left numerous messages with her alos about getting the Guaranty. Carol    Tanya Rohauer 05/31/2000 09:28 AM

 Rod:  There are 2 open issues on Dresdner Bank:  1. Netting - they are saying that operationally they cannot net across product lines.  Are you okay with this?  2. Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.  Since we have no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations required under each transaction that we enter into with them. Specifically, the CA does the following:  - calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash Settlement Amount payable - gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates - determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred  Also, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty  cap to $25,000,000 from $15,000,000.  Is that okay with you?  They had initially requested no cap.   On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following credit issues:  1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.  You were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.  They wanted to amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified Transaction.  2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?  3. On Credit Event Upon Merger, they want to define "materially weaker" as either (1) being below investment grade by either S&P or Moody's or (2) being failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.  4. On setoff, they did not have the "affiliate" language.  5. In the CSA, they want the collateral that is posted to secure both financial deals and physical gas and power deals entered into between ENA and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  6. In the collateral threshold, they have proposed a matrix of S&P and Moody's ratings, with the threshold amount being the lower of the 2 ratings.  AA-/Aa3 and above  $20,000,000 A-/A3 to A+/A1   $15,000,000 BBB/Baa2 to BBB+/Baa1  $10,000,000 BBB-/Baa3  $5,000,000  Also, they have defined MAC  to be going below BBB- by S&P or below Baa3 by Moody's or a failure to be rated by either S&P or Moody's.   7. In the LC provisions, they have different cure periods for each of the types of Letter of Credit Defaults that can occur.  Here is a summary of the events and the time periods for transferring substitute colateral:  - If issuer's credit rating is downgraded - 1 business Day after written demand by the Secured Party - if issuer fails to comply with its obligations under the LC or disaffirms or rejects the LC - 1 Business day after the pledgor receives notice of dishonor - if LC fails to be in full force and effect or issuer declares bankruptcy - 3 Business Days after written demand by Secured Party  In our form, we require substitute collateral to be posted within 2 Business Days of the occurrence of the above events, except for a downgrade where the time period is 5 Business Days      On SG Interests, you were going to talk to them about certain credit issues.   Please let me know when you can where you stand on the above.  Thanks.  Carol 
 Paul: Did you mean to refer to dates in June?  Alos, could you let me know which persons or persons will be handling the areas that we need covered as so far I am only aware of you and Scott and i wasn't sure if others would be involved.  Thanks.

 John: My fault.  It should say "succeeding Scheduled Payment Date" and Scheduled Payment Date is defined in Section 14 of the ISDA form.  As far as choice of law, we can go with NY although I disagree with your counsel, in that in order for the New York choice of law to be enforced by a court, the parties have to demonstrate some minimum relationship with the jurisdiction chose.

 Sara and Jason: Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.  It seems like we could amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used in each conform:  Payment Date NCDC NWS HDD CDD The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station Data Sources  Let me know what you think.  Carol  Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already set forth in the Master? 
 Shari: The confirms desk has asked us to think about a way that we could shorten the confirms that are sent out under Master Agreements by amending each Master to include definitions/provisions that are common to all confirms.  Below is what I have come up with.  Do you see any problems with this? Carol 
 Charles was my mother's dad's name and Eugene is my dad's name.    Suzanne Adams 06/01/2000 11:01 AM 
 Sara and Jason: Shari's response to the message that I sent to you. Carol 
 Mark and Jarrod: Regarding this project of streamlining weather confirms, Shari asked about the new language that we were gong to use to define the procedures for determining the Fallback reference Weather Station.  Has that language ever been finalized?  This is one of the things that I thought we could pull out of the confirms so before we send out any Master Agreement amendments, we should try to get this language finalized. Carol 
 Scott, Bruce, Sam and John: Gaurav has informed me that the next draft of the ACE insurance policy will be distributed by ACE sometime tomorrow.  What we would like to do is schedule a time on Monday that we could talk with you about it with the hope that we could have a discussion with ACE soon afterward.

Finally, it's my understanding that the comparison Annex A that we will attach to the letter will be the new Annex A that has been compared to the old annex a with the name change.  Thanks. Carol

 At Lisa Mellencamp's request I am sending you the amendment agreements that we have drafted with respect to the physical and financial masters between KCS and Enron.

If you have any questions, please call me or Lisa. My number is 853-3989. Carol 
 Enclosed is a revised draft of the policy without any modifications on the exclusions as this is an area that ACE is apparently continuing to develop. As I mentioned yesterday, we will talk with you about this on Monday at 1(Houston time).  Our commercial team would then like to have a call with ACE sometime after our call to talk about exclusions, subrogation rights and matters relating to books and records that are addressed in the policy.  I don't think that all of you need to be on this call but was wondering if any of you would be available for this call.  Please let me know.

 Grant: This is where things stand with Talisman.  They owe me a new draft based on comments that I made a few weeks ago and once I get that I need to have Dave Forester bless all of the chnages.  I think we are close. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Mark: FYI. Carol 
 Leslie and Elizabeth FYI. Carol 
 Here are my comments to the latest set of swap docs:  1. In the swap assignment, I think that the definition of Regulated Subsidiary can be deleted.  2. In Section 3.4 of the swap assignment, in the new language that was added at the very end, shouldn't it say after the words "Swap Agreement" "(as it relates to the Assigned Interest)"?  In other words, if these events as to Party B happen and it results in either an event of default or termination event under the swap, shouldn't Party A be entitled to terminate the Swap Agreement with respect to the portion that is not being assigned?  3. I'm assuming that the changes to Section 3.5(e) track some current cross default language that Enron is now using.  4. In Section 3.8, the word comments should be "consents".  Nora: Per my voice mail message to you, I'm assuming that you are okay with Section 5.6.    Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax) 
 Russell: There are several credit issues here that we need to discuss like:  1. Their comment on the affiliate language in the setoff provision - I don't think that they understand how this works.  2. Their first and second comments to the CSA.  3. Their comment in the CSA about requiring a different standard for holding collateral.  4. Their desire to change from Fed Funds Rate to LIBOR  5. Their renewal notice comment concerning the LC.   Please call me to discuss.  Also, Susan Bailey and I need to talk with you about Global Companies LLC. Carol    Russell Diamond 06/02/2000 04:26 PM 
 Jeff, Stacy and Harry: We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as something credit can send to counterparties? Thanks. carol

 Alicia The only comment that I have to the swap schedules is that I think we need to have an exception built into the arbitration language that permits us to go to court to enforce the remedies that we describe in the confidentiality section.  This probably hold true for all of the docs where we have arbitration and a ca provision.  Alos, there may be some defined terms that are now used in the new confidentiality language that haven't been defined (i.e, Enron, Enron Put Agreement etc)  Finally, should we upper case "affiliates" in the confidentiality   language and either use the ISDA def or some other def? Carol 
 Suzanne: I reserved this class in my own name so that Samantha Boyd, our new legal assistant who is starting today, could attend.  Could you please contact whoever needs to be contacted and switch names.  Erica, Please put this class on Samantha's calendar.  Carol

 Doug: Please talk with Mark Taylor on who should handle this in our group as given my situation, I will probably not be able to take this on. Carol    Doug McDowell 06/05/2000 10:42 AM 
 Steve: I spoke with Rod Nelson, our credit person, about the cross default language and we have the following proposal to make.  We are okay with the language as it applies to declaring a an Event of Default and then declaring an early Termination Date.  For purposes of triggering a reduction of the collateral threshold to zero, we would propose that this language would not apply such that an event of Default would be triggered upon the occurrence of the cross default.  Let me know what you think. Carol

 Joe: If we need to develop a form of confirm for this, are you the person that I should work with or would someone else handle this?  Rod, Since we are doing a separate GTC for this product, we will not be able to "net" on any payment date what we owe the counterparty under this product against what the counterparty may owe us under other derivative products. Are you okay with this?  Alos, we have been assuming that there are no other counterparty credit issues with this product since other than the upfront premium, payments will be made from us to them.  Are we safe in assuming this? Carol 
 Mark: Here is a summary of what I am currently working on. Carol 
 Rob: Enclosed is what I think should be the final form of the Schedules.  I have made some clean-up chnages.  In the LC,. my notes indicate that we were going to keep the renewal language in.

 Sara and I met with Richard Sanders today to resolve some questions that we had concerning the arbitration and process agent language in our forms and here is what we concluded needed to be done:  1. If arbitration is chosen, there is no need to insert Waiver of Jury Trial language  2. Pending discussions that he will be having with Mark Haedicke and Jim Derrick, no chnages need to be made to our arbitration language.  3. Our Process Agent language will be revised such that under all circumstances it will say the following:  Party A appoints as its Process Agent , ____________, having an office in ________________ on the date of this Agreement at __________________.  Party B appoints as its Process Agent, __________________, having an office in _______________ on the date of this Agreement at ______________.   Susan Bailey, Could you please get from our corporate secretary's office the information that we need to fill in the blanks for ENA and ECC?  If you have any questions, please call me or Sara.  Carol 
 Suzanne: I need to schedule a 1 hour meeting with Julia to talk about maternity leave issues.  Could you please work with her secretary to set something up next week?  Thanks. Carol 
 Jeff: We have received a request from the above counterparty to alter the format of the confirmation process on physical and financial deals.  In lieu of signing each confirm that is sent to them, what they want to send back to us is a letter signed by them in which they describe the confirm and indicate whether or not they accept or disagree with the terms thereof and if they disagree with such terms, they will return the confirm.  Are you okay with this procedure? Carol 
 Susan: Regarding Kate's e-mail, I have left a voice mail for Richard Sanders as to which office we should designate.  If you need to send out the ISDA draft before I hear back from him and before Kate hears back from Canada, go ahead and leave the address blank and we can fill it in later. Carol 
 Mark and Sara: Tana came into my office last night and seemed to be very upset about how the other 2 legal assistants were treating her, especially Susan Bailey, and also about the fact taht Susan Bailey was going to be part of Samantha's training and that this was a surprise to her.  On the latter issue, I explained to her that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.  I am very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous. The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.  I explained to her that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.  On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to work better is through "communicating" to each other.  I firmly believe taht there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.  Tana of course will not admit this.  I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired of hearing about why they can't get along.  I also told Tana taht it was my perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.  I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.  Carol 
 Bill: I would like to go to this.  Okay with you? Carol 
 Rhett: I have asked the attorney that I am working with on this to call you directly about their proposed tax rep language as well as their deletion of the language in Part 3 regarding the delivery of tax docs.  I have enclosed below the language that we currently have in the Schedule which they would not accept and I believe you have their proposed language on the tax reps. Thanks again for your help.  I just think that at this point it is easier for the tax folks to talk directly to each other. Carol 
 Tana: Mark has asked me to handle the Mexico issues in connection with EOL trading.  I understand that you have copies of what has been sent to and received from Mexican counsel.  Could you before you leave tomorrow give me copies of all correspondence as well as copies of the more current questionnaires taht we have been sending out so that I can start following up with them on Monday?  Thanks. Carol 
 Brant: In response to your voice mail regarding El Paso, Occidental and Aquila Canada, I can follow up with my contacts at El Paso and Occidental.  Please provide me with the name of the attorney at Aquila Canada and I will call him or her.  Carol 
 Mark: Just 2 thoughts on the new draft:  1. In the definition of Global Early Termination Date, how does this work with the new Section 16 concept that Alicia has added to the Schedules whereby the termination of Transactions that raise Section 16 problems may be delayed?  2. Does Section 5.06 conflict at all with the proviso in the Limitation of Liability sections of both Schedules?  Carol

 Jason: I thought that your drfat letter of intent looked fine.  Just a few commments.  In section 6 - Conditions, could you put something in there similar to the "Approvals" section in the November 10th letter since possibly HSR and FERC approval may be needed?  Alos, in Attachment A, in Section 3 could you sya something to the effect that if tthere is no master in place with Enron and a particular counterparty then Enron needs to be satisfied with the terms of the master that is in place between Mrechant and such counterparty.  I thought that the Assignment Agreement was very weak and that we need something more than that.  Withg respect to the consent, the concept of the assigned transaction be goverened by our Master needs to be in there. Enclosed is the template that we have used in the Columbia deal.  Call me if you have any questions.  The only time that I won't be reachable today is from 11:30-2.  Carol 
 Gaurav: I sent to Bruce Wright our comments to the policy last night and asked that he incorporate them into his mark-uo and distribute it to ACE and us.  Please e-mail him with your fax number as well as the fax numbers for the people at Ace.  Thanks. Carol

 Cement: Enclosed is the Enron Guaranty that we need executed in connection with an ISDA Master Agreement that we have finalized with Idacorp Energy Solutions LP.  We would like to have the Master become effective next week so would it be possible to have this signed next week?  If you have any questions, please call me or Susan Flynn. Carol 
 Rob: I received the documents and Susan Flynn will get them executed along with the Enron Guaranty and the other certificates and get them back to you next week.  My question for you is when you consider the agreement to be effective for trading purposes?  I'm assuming you want to wait for the Enron Guaranty and that any trades done before the Guaranty is sent to you would not be confirmed under the Master.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.  I have asked Enron's counsel to process the Guaranty ASAP.  Thanks. Carol 
 John: I have reviewed the new draft and just have a few nits which I will send you.  My only disagreement is with the LC language.  We feel very strongly that we need the LC provisions and the form of lc.  The LC provisions are between us and you and have nothing to do with the LC bank who will be issuing the LC.  They set forth the mechanics for the rights that each party has with respect to any LC that is issued for its benefit.  These mechanics need to be agreed to ahead of time.  The form of LC ties into these mechanics.  Our credit group will work with you when an LC is issued if for some reason the language in the LC does not exactly match.  I look forward to hearing from you. Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Shuttee, John" <ShutteeJ@EPEnergy.com> 06/09/2000 01:15 PM

I am truly overwhelmed by everyone's generosity and look forward to finally putting all of my gifts to good use in the upcoming weeks. Carol

 Joe: Can you take a look at the product description that we have drafted in the next day or two and let me know how we can turn this into a confirm? Thanks. Carol 
 Carolyn: I'm hoping that you can help me with this.  One  of the gifts that I received on Friday was 2 outfits from Baby Gap.  There was no card.  The only people that were at the shower that I couldn't account for based on the gifts that I received with cards and group gift list that I saw were Anne Yaeger, Mark Taylor, Tana Jones and Mary Heinitz.  Could you please confirm for me that these people did not participate on the group gift?  Thanks. Carol 
 Dave: I will check with Tana on this and yes, she will handle the notifications. Carol    David Forster@ENRON 06/12/2000 09:23 AM 
 Tana: Can you tell me if any of the more recent ETA amendment letters that we have sent out for execution refer to the new termination number?  My recollection is that maybe only 1 or 2 did. Carol 
 Carolyn: Thanks.  If there is some discreet way to check with Mark, Anne, Tana and Mary about this I would really appreciate it.  I'm guessing that the gift came from Anne.  Again, it was from Baby Gift on University Blvd. and it was 2 one piece outfits - 1 with an Elephant/Turtle/Bear design and 1 with a Monkey design.  Thanks for your help.

 Anne: I'm slightly embarrassed to be asking you this, but there was one gift from Baby Gap that we can't seem to figure out who the "giver" was, and we've narrowed it down to a group that includes you.  It was 2 outfits with animal patterns on it.  Are you the mystery giver?  Alos, again I just wanted to say congratulations again on your engagement.  I am really happy for you and Trushar and wish you all the best.  I will try to see if we can get together for lunch before I leave.  Carol

 Please plan to attend a lunch this coming Friday in 30C2 with Sara and I and possibly some of the newer credit people to go through basic ISDA, CSA and confirmation issues.  We'll get started around Noon and probably go until 1:30.  Carol 
 Tanya: This coming Friday Sara and I are going to walk the legal assistants through some basic concepts with respect to the ISDA and CSA Schedules and confirmations.  Do you think that we should invite some of the newer credit people to this and if so, who?  Some of this will be a repeat of what we did a few weeks ago but at a more basic level.  We were thinking that it may be beneficial for Nidia Mendoza and Cathy Tudon.  Let me know what you think. Carol 
 Mark: Please see the enclosed draft CA. Carol 
 Susan: Please coordinate this.  Thanks. Carol

 Jeff: Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent would be?  Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.  Is this a role that Enron Corp. can and should perform?  With respect to the Agreement, I am looking at a June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the language in Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.

 Willie: Thanks for your voice mail message.    As I explained to Joe and David, on all of the counterparties where we have "EOL Issues" I need to know what those issues are and then I will call them.  Could you please advise Joe and/or David about this and then I will follow up.  The only issue that we discussed was the issue that these counterparties are thinking that the clicking requirement in the ETA applies to confirms which it doesn't.  Thanks for your help. Carol

 Jeff: Who on the commercial side is deciding who the CA would be?  As I explained to Nora yesterday, I think that the Enron CA should the Enron entity whose commercial people will be in charge of this deal after it is closed.  As far as 2(c) is concerned, would this require us to hand over confidential information?    Is Section 3 the business deal if someone other than Enron is the CA?  With respect to Section 7, in Section 7(a) shouldn't the term "Event of Default" be tied to the Events of Default in the Swap Assignment?  With respect to Sections 7(b) and (c), I just want to make sure that everyone is okay with the events that could lead to the removal of Enron as the CA since I would think that this is something that we would not want to happen.  For example, 7(b)(ii) seems to be a trigger that could accidentally happen and the removal of Enron as the CA seems to be a harsh penalty.  I'll defer on this to whatever you and the commercial folks want to do.  Carol St. Clair EB 3892 713-853-3989 (Phone) 713-646-3393 (Fax)    "Eldredge, Jeff" <jeldredge@velaw.com> 06/14/2000 04:20 AM

This one assumes that we are the confirming party but it can be modified if the counterparty is the confirming party and we want to send this.  I will work on  modifying Southern's cover letter into something that we could send to our counterparties.  Call me if you have any questions. Carol
