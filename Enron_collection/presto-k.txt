 Jim,  Please provide a quick update.   I was unable to participate in your call today because of a market risk mtg. with UBS.    I will be out Wednesday through Friday so I would like to hear directly from you what FERC's state of mind was. 
 This is Mirant's argument.   Don't think it will hold water, but you never know. 
 We don't need a floor talk.  I asked Tom to set up a meeting in 30C1 with origination, mid-marketing, and services.   This is not going to be a floor talk. 
 I would like to be able to select days, months, years, etc. for historical liquidation.   Somehow, we need to make the cubes or Metastock more user friendly so the traders will actually use them.  I have tried to use the cubes and, although the data is extremely powerful, scrolling through all the years and months is quite cumbersome and drilling down is a pain.  Can we somehow improve the user friendliness of these tools.  Thanks. 
 Find out if owners of current season tickets get grandfathered for equivalent seats in the new arena.   If so, I would be interested.   If not, I would say no. 
 I like our traditional measurment better.   This is good data, but is more relevant for cash traders than term traders. 
 I have received 
 Yes, authorized.  Thanks. 
 I am not approving any new Kobra applications. 
 This is a test.   Kevin Presto Vice President, East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 This is the retail book, not the wholesale book.   You can get confirmation on this issue from Bill Bradford or Elizabeth Sager. 
 thanks for the heads up. 
 Could you please create an org chart by function (retained employees) and org chart by function (severed employees) so we can reconcile to make sure we have not missed anyone.  Once we have done this, we can create a seating plan that is optimal.   Please e-mail me the org. charts so I have an electronic version.  Thanks.  Kevin Presto Vice President, East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 Please kill this request.   I get 4 everyday. 
 Thanks.   That will work fine with me. 
 The only issue I have is everytime I login I have some Windows Installer program I have to kill and it takes me an extra 2-3 minutes to keep closing files before I can get into my desktop.  I don't know what caused this, but I am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run.   In addition, the dial-up through Citrix is very very slow.   Is this normal?  Any thoughts?  Thanks for all your work - the printer works just fine 
 Your thoughts on this guy? 
 Please stop sending me this report. 
 OK - Tim did say he blew up trading options in the West.   Played the "premium is profit" game selling summer calls at Palo Verde and we all know what happened.   Bye Bye Ricky. 
 My Holdings page is still not netting.   I just purchased 5000 DYN shares - please make sure the netting works.  Kevin Presto Vice President, East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 Get him in the door.  Work with Kim Melodick in HR to make it happen. 
 Looks fine.   You need to start learning.   Work with Kim. 
 I think I can get Jeff King done with a simple title change from Associate Director to Director with no salary change.   His current salary is already Director level type comp.   I potentially may need another 25k, but the title is a "feel good" issue that is important to Jeff.   Please talk to Doug directly on the justification. 
 See request below. 
 It's the trader's option.  Most will probably not attend. 
 The time is right in the middle of trading on an AGA day.   Therefore, it is unlikely that anyone managing a stack will be able to attend.   I would suggest having Tom May and/or Lloyd attend. 
 Agreed.  As far as I'm concerned, we are arbing the market. 
 No.   We buy and sell where we see value.   We don't even look at the other exchanges. 
 I would like to recommend to following allocations of retention $'s - THIS CREATES NO NET IMPACT ON TOTAL $'S ON THE SPREADSHEET  Gain 575 cash 450 equity (Rogers Herndon, John Forney, Joe Wagner, Tom May)  Re-allocate in the following manner: Cash		Equity Arora		+75k		+75k Gilb-Smith	+25k		+25k King		+25k		+25k Gupta		+25k		+25k Misra		+75k		+75k Suarez		+50k		+50k Carson		+25k		+25k Imai		+25k		+25k Steffes		+50k		+50k (we will lose key reg people if we don't pay) Nicolay		+50k		+50k ("                            "                            ") Novosel		+25k		+25k ("                            "                            ")    Please call with any questions.   I feel very good about keeping nearly all of these people at the levels above and we could lose some key ones if we don't do this. Again, I am not spending any additional $'s - I am simply taking from other people who will not be part of UBS.

 I would treat it as business as usual.   If we are still having Associate/Analyst Super Saturday, we certainly can attend an energy panel discussion. 
 Can I get a deal like that for my house.   Wow!  I'll be here until about 2:30 today. 
 Wednesday is the worst day due to AGA.   We normally trade until 4:00 pm on AGA days.   Therefore, I would suggest Tuesday or Thursday. 
 Please have Mark call me at work today.   My phone # is 713-853-5035. 
 Thank you.   Is the black cover going to be removed so other employees know the spot is reserved? 
 We have a meeting with Evans Automation next Saturday 11/10 at 10:30 am (near Kemah).   Please mark the calender.  Thanks.

 Very efficient CC gas units in Entergy and ERCOT are setting price.  Midwest and Plains has gas setting price 4-6 hours per day and coal the remaining 10 hours.   The NE markets (NY and NEPOOL) are the only markets with 10,000 HR gas units setting price across the entire peak.  Keep in mind that current temps are truly "no load" temps for East power (no heating or cooling demand).   The addition of new combined cycle units in our market have been destructive to forward heat rates.  Later. 
 I'm fine with it.   They will only see through Cal 03 though. 
 Please set up a time with my asst. to discuss job opportunities in East Power.   Bring a hard copy of your resume. 
 I view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites (gas and power) with the Estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore.   The estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business, but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors.  I can't imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by UBS and the Estate.   I am not planning on giving any of the data to the Estate.   I feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well.   One of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area.   Kevin Presto East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 Make sure we are crystal clear on being able to fill this position physically at any VEPCO interface (hourly or day-ahead), and the PJM/VEPCO PJM LMP index is for pricing only. 
 The LD should be the hourly index. 
 The LD calc should be the hourly index and we need to eliminate the Peak Day designation damages. 
 Dana is interested in talking to JT about a scheduling and/or hourly job. 
 I will buy 5x16 unit contingent power $3.50/Mwh below my curve for 02 only for into JEA delivery.   I will buy firm LD at my mid for into JEA delivery 
 My preference is normal energy only LD language.  If we agree to use an index pricing point (like PJM/VEPCO interface), then a fair trade-off is to eliminate the capacity ratchet. 
 No interest. 
 Please e-mail me the latest East Power Org Chart (including services and Genco).  Thanks. 
 We plan to be done trading at 1:00 pm on Friday. 
 Thanks Joe.  It was a pleasure having you as part of the team.   I respect you as a person and a professional and I wish you nothing but the best in your future career.   Please stay in touch with the team.  Good luck Joe.

 I apologize for my earlier comments.   Everyone is having a rough time with the current meltdown of the company.   I have been here 7 years and I am seeing everything I worked for coming to an end.  It's not your fault and I do apologize. 
 Agreed. 
 I sold 5,000 MMBtu/day of Cal 04 NYMEX at 3.79/MMBtu. 
 The hourly index is a must for me (the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years).   It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure, VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge. I will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined.  Please clarify your call option vs. firm delivery comment. 
 We will not be trading on Thanksgiving.   However, we will have a skeleton crew in here on Friday.   I proposed calcing P&L on Wednesday and not on Friday. 
 Please place on my calender. 
 What do you mean only the left side. 
 What a piece of shit this whole BTU market is.   Your mid-offer spreads look very reasonable to me. 
 Yes. 
 Fine. 
 King, Carson, Suarez, Gupta, Broderick, Schiavone, Misra, Wang, and Ballato also need to be able to trade gas (or there equivalent trading books need to be able to trade gas if the above names change). 
 Agreed.   I think Bradford already blew up the Constellation deal. 
 Thanks.   Sounds like you are having a blast.   See ya on Sunday.   How about them Canes. 
 sold 10,000 MMbtu/day of Cal 05 nymex at $3.695/mmbtu. sold 5,000 mmbtu/day of cal 04 nymex at $3.58/mmbtu. 
 The old lady says no.   So far, there is 5 power guys that will play if the game is on. 
 No interest in pursuing this business. 
 Any value in this? 
 I'm supposed to be in Disneyworld with the family for my first vacation in two years.   Sorry, but I can't swing it. 
 I usually do, but she's been holding out. 
 Please put Allan Stewart Contact information (get from Rogers) in My Outlook contacts - home, cell, work, address, etc. and put a reminder on my calender to call him to re-establish contract relationship.  Also, please put a reminder to call Fred Giffels regarding consulting agreement and FPL. 
 I'll defer to you and Lloyd on this one. 
 Please attend. 
 Have HGP attend. 
 No. 
 I talked to Giffels today and he mentioned that SONGS units are under serious security scrutiny given its location.   He gave us a 50/50 probability that Indian Pt 1&2 (30 minutes north of NY City) and Pilgrim (15 minutes north of Boston) would be shut down in the near term for security reasons.  He mentioned that SONGS was also a candidate.   I personally don't think the probability is that high, nonetheless, the rumors seem to be in the market. 
 Please attend meetings 1 and 3 and provide meeting summaries directly to Rika for internal distribution.  Thanks. 
 I will be out Wednesday through Friday on vacation.   Please have Dana Davis, Fletch Sturm, Rob Benson, Andy Zipper, and Doug Gilbert-Smith represent East Power in my absense.  Thanks.

 I'll get back with you on this within a couple of days.   Do you want an indicative bid for 7x24 bus-bar energy (2, 5 and 10 years).

 See changes attached with one subtraction (Joe Step) and one addition (Doug Gilbert-Smith). 
 The ESCA energy management system (EMS) in an industry standard software package to provide control area services and energy accounting in compliance with NERC standards.   We used the software and hardware for remotely controlling/operating/dispatching our peaker plants and also used the software in 3rd party "outsourcing/services" deals in ERCOT and SPP.  I hope this helps.

 Calender. 
 Is this the office I selected?    Please confirm. 
 Don't worry christi - I recognize what a great job your group did this year.   It was by far the best regulatory effort (from a power perspective) with more results than any of the previous 7 years I was at Enron.   You and your team deserve a great deal of credit and if we can keep this team together, we will reap the benefits for years to come. 
 Can I hire Martin Lin back into Netco from the estate.   He has provided va= luable transmission & dispatch modeling expertise to our fundies group (he = worked for Vince in Research).   We have lost Anna Santucci to CMS and this= would not change our headcount in the fundies group.  Additionally, if I was forced to cut additional bodies, most of the cuts wo= uld likely come from real-time (3), options (2), regional trading (2), logi= stics (1-2).  For Martin's planning purposes, I need to know something ASAP.   Thanks. 
 Joe Holmes from IdaCorp (208-318-2100) called and expressed interest in Enron's services deals in the NA, presumably in the West.  Don - can you have someone follow-up.   thanks.  Kevin Presto Vice President, East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 OK. 
 Yes, that would be fine.   I would also like to talk about my fixed annual fee.   Based on the way I trade, and the amount of asset accumulaton, I think my fee is too high.   Please call me about this issue so we can discuss. 
 Thanks. 
 Please begin scrubbing the 02 and 03 new gen book again given the current situation in the energy market.   I would like a new forecast in 30 days if possible.  In addition, I would like begin running the unit commitment model (dispatch) and "knock" the cob webs off everyone.   Let's plan on having a meeting to go over what the new daily reports were going to look like - wasn't Gus working on this?  What is the status of the transmission modeling?  Can we integrate the system dispatch and LMP simulation models?   Kevin Presto Vice President, East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272

 Thanks Chris.   I agree with the approach.   It would be nice to handout a bound copy to all of the East and West trading/marketing desk heads for a thorough review to make sure we have not missed anything.  See you tommorow. 
 Do you want me to put docs in front of Harry, Rogers, and/or Doug?  Kevin Presto East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 Can we update the laminated card with the most recent headcount and phone #'s.? 
 Same as Chris. 
 I concur with Jim on approach with one clarification.   Transmission providers discussions should include both a trading rep and marketing rep. 
 shapiro is a lazier version of Steffes. 
 Christi Nicolay and Sarah Novosel are the two best regulatory people.   In terms of pushing the timing, political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay.   Obviously, that will not work anymore.   I have a good relationship with Larcamp (FERC head of Staff) and might be able to help with the politics.   I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from  the new owner.   If we want speed, I recommend we use the expertise of Christi and Sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner.  You are not off base with Steffes at all. 
 Please print and save file for me.

 I want to make sure we get the hardware and software (I agree that this is = already the property of ENA) into Netco like we have the rest of the softwa= re/hardware critical to the trading organization.   The payable is sunk and= should be left with the estate. 
 All East Traders will have East only trading rights except for me.    With respect to regions, assume the same organization as we ended with in early November.   The one change is Rogers in the SE along with Suarez, and Carson.  MW - Fletch, Russell, and Jason SE - Rogers, Suarez, Carson ERCOT - Doug, King, Schiavone, Saibi NE - Dana, Benson, Gupta, Broderick, Thomas (off-peak), Misra, Rogers, Makkai, Step, Schneider Options - Arora, Stalford, Wang, Gualy Real-Time - Forney (ERCOT), Baughman (MW/SE), Miguel (MW/SE)  Remember, all of the desk heads will have gas trading authority as well.   None of the prompt month cash traders will be trading gas. 
 kmpresto@hotmail.com 
 Do you already have this list.   Please send all templates to Chris Calger, Elizabeth Sager, and Mitch Robinson.  thanks. 
 Please incorporate Dana's changes into the Master. 
 Yes. 
 Please print a copy of each for me. 
 Attached are Dana's additions. 
 Maybe.   If we truly believe this is a credit starved industry with huge liquidity problems, then we should be able to dictate the terms for dealing with a AA entity........ end of story.  We should send this message early and often.   If we don't, the market will percieve that negotiating "one-off" terms for trading docs is acceptable.   I disagree with this approach from a long term philosophical standpoint.   We either believe our bullshit or we don't. 
 Please get final version to Tammie by COB tommorow.  thanks. 
 Please send this attachment to the same list I just provided.  thanks. 
 FYI - trumped already. 
 Attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning.   I have added the additional columns everyone requested.   I would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial Power Implementation Plan that can be delivered to Louise on Friday.  With respect to East Power (I am out Thursday and Friday), I am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following: 1) Have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete 2) A product offering sheet is added to the template.  Fletch & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list (physical and financial).  My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions (financial and physical).   Obviously, the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license.  Cory and Don Baughman - Please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the East (Christi has started a list already).  Please call me on my cell (713-856-3923) with any questions.   Kevin Presto Vice President, East Power Trading Phone:  713-853-5035 Cell:  713-854-3923 Fax:  713-646-8272 
 Andy can trade all regions and all commodities (just like a desk head).    He is replacing Harry. 
 FYI. 
 Please put on my calender and remind everyone on Wednesday.  Thanks. 
 The same attachment was sent again in case you had trouble opening the previous file.   I am sending from home via the network and have been having some problems.   Sorry to e-mail you to death. 
 The attached document should complement the documents sent earlier by Chris Calger.   Hopefully, the combination of the two will provide some organization and focus at our 9:30 am meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the "NETCO" Start-up initiatives. 
 Please keep Rogers contact info for his vacation.  Thanks. 
 I believe Wabash has also terminated.  Don, As you know, we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time.   Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred.   I think the meeting is warranted, however, we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues.  I will see you on Wednesday at 2:00 pm. 
 See note below.   Upon confirmation from Portz, please remove Wabash from the non-termination counterparty list. 
 Did you submit my expenses from the CT trip? 
 Obviously, we will not deliver (or receive if we are long) if the transaction would result in negative cash flow for the estate on a "net counterparty" basis.   Therefore, FE and TXU obligations would not be met for the 1st week of January because they result in negative cash flow.  Cory, Please make sure going forward that we only include positive cash flow counterparties in the weekly projections.   Please exclude the TXU and FE positions from  the net position report as well.   We will likely begin filling the non-pool positions starting next Wednesday.  Jason - Please send to Cory (I was unable to from home) 
 Don,  This looks good.   You have my blessing to proceed with approval from the cash committee.   You can reach me at home (713-856-7483) if you have any additional questions.  Thanks. 
 175k/yr.   Wow - you get em. 
 Wisconsin's offer is a joke.  Carl - This is is clearly a two-way termination or they would have no offer at all (I'm assuming you understand the difference).   We can buy Cal-02 Com-Ed under $30/Mwh all day long.   This is a position we will deliver on to preserve the in-the money value.   I would make it clear to Wisconsin that we intend on delivering in January and every single month thereafter because it creates positive cash flow for the estate.   We also have broker quotes that show the market is 28 at 29 for Cal 02.   I would accept nothing less  than $1.2 million.  Thanks. 
 Olgethorpe has officially terminated as of Dec. 20, 2001.   Please see attached. 
 Please send me a summary.  Thanks. 
 I cancelled this over 4 months ago.   Someone might have assumed by terminal. 
 You are very welcome.   You have been a fantastic asst for me and could not have achieved what we have as a group without you.  Thanks again for all of your hard work and have a Very Happy Holidays! 
 We are not to discuss credit issues with any counterparties. 
 Did this meeting get confirmed? 
 See you Monday. 
 We need to do what the
