 Going to Scottsdale Wednesday night for a little sun, spa, and relaxation!   Have fun in Houston - 
 I'm still going to do it.  I found out about one trip/lessons - 7 days in Austrailia (Great Barrier Reef) - October - 40 ft. Beneteau - you are ASA certified at the end.  In other words, you could rent a sailboat anywhere in the world when you are done.  However, as fun and as cool as it sounds - it may not be doable.  Also, got the name of a guy in Keemah that my friends took lessons from a few years ago.  I might give him a call - he may be expensive - they had their own boat.  I will keep you posted - 
 What is the plan for tonight?  I am leaving and going home now.  Where would you like to meet and what time? 
 Still employed?  How are you affected by this bankruptcy news?

 Sara,  Salt River Project has attached their Schedule to the Master and their Credit support Annex to this email.  I know we have sent them our docs in the past so I don't know where this will take us.  It doesn't look like they have entered the pertinent credit information into the annex.  Are they expecting us to do this?  Please let me know what you think.  The guy that sent this to me is Mark Russell and his email address is below.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Some of these are pretty funny - 
 Hey,  Can you send over a list of people you know in this industry,  their companies and maybe their phone numbers?  For my charity golf tournament.  They were due on Tuesday.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Send me your phone list as soon as you get a chance - my fax is 713-464-2391, phone 30685. THanks,  Kim 
 Did  you get a credit worksheet from Jay for Midesto Irrigation District - for a master Enfolio?  Kim 
 Jay,  Please call me when you get a chance. I have a list of customers that we use to serve out of our Socal pool that we want back.  However, we need to establish credit.  and then maybe some contracts.  Can I do < 1 year with these guys without a master ?  Maybe use the GTC?  I need to make some $ so WE can go to Pebble beach.  Kim 
 I left a message for ginger yesterday for lunch or dinner but havn't heard back.

 Mark,  The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.  Thanks for your inquiry -  Kim Ward 
 I left him a couple of messages but never heard back.  I will try to follow= up again today. 
 Jim,  Are you and or Steve Thome working with Black hills?  Should we work with E= OL to get them online instead of rejected?=20  Kim 
 here it is.  Check out B.4. and the last sentence which is our shared profit language.  Call me. 
 Sara,  I would like to set up a conference call with you and my counterparts at the City of Glendale.  They have some questions regarding some currency language.  Just let me know when you are available and I will set it up with Glendale.  I'm sorry I can't be more clear - I got the information off of a voice message.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dan,  An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple noti= ces.  PG&E can confiscate gas if a scheduling party is not in compliance.  = The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for Emergency flow or= der.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Chris,  Could you send me Mary @ Socal's phone number - for the very last time?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Were we able to put together an agreement for Midesto Irrigation District? 
 Chris,  The package you sent me was delayed due to weather - I should get it in am. 
 I will try to show up - since it is right down the street from my house!  Looking forward to it!  Kim 
 I couldn't find your phone number -  financial offer at PG&E City Gate for 2 years out of may is $8.97.  Add $.14 for phys.  Kim

 when is the meeting and where?  thanks,  Kim 
 Here is Tucsons information.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks,  Kim 
 The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.  Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!! 
 Sorry I am just now replying - busy afternoon and I'm trying to get out for the baseball game.  My roulette number is 10.  I don't know how lucky it is, but it would be the number I would pick.  Have fun in vegas -  See ya, Kim 
 Chris,  I didn't make that many changes and I didn't change the ENA profit section.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I will be on my cell phone after 4:00 p.m. here - going to opening day at Enron Field!!  Here it is - and I will have a copy and be able to discuss with you when you are ready.  Most of the desk is gone.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Yes, april 6th.  When I talked to her, she didn't think that Continental would have a seat avail for Memorial weekend, just like we said.  I think she is out. 
 Camille Gerard, a guy from the calgary office, and ja 
 mY messenger went down.  I am going with the same crew. Oh Yo 
 no.  See ya thurs. 
 Yes - if there is a spare ticket.  Boy, am I tired! 
 Tom,  Attached is your spreadsheet with the price indications that you asked for.  Call me if you need any thing else.  Kim 
 where's my email? 
 Dan,  Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that are fixed will not include TW transport charges.  Thanks again,  Kim  ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into the system? 
 Michael,  FYI, I checked the physical premium for PG&E city gate for 10 years out of 2005 and the desk quoted $.07.   Hope this is helpful.  Kim 
 Chris,  this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.  Kim 
 Monica,  Attached is the previous draft contract with Grants latest wording inserted.  If you guys are agreeable, please accept the red-line changes, print 2 originals, sign, and forward to me for final execution.  I hope this is what you guys were expecting.  Please let me know if it is not so I can get with Dan.  Thanks for your help!  Kim 
 Me too!  I just got here - 
 Dan,  What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will forward to Monica?  Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?  Thanks,  Kim 
 Enron and two other counterparties 
 How was the air show? 
 Hi Jeff,  Laird gave me your name and number so that I can pass on notional price information that you asked for.  Let me know anytime you need to see our price indications and I will do what I can to help you.  I know that Laird has worked with you guys extensively.  The prices that he said you were looking at are listed below and are based on PG&E City gate prices:  Q4, 2001                			    $11.70 2 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2003		    $ 6.80 5 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2006		    $ 5.85 Oct. 2001 - Dec. 2003	  		    $ 7.38  I tried to call but it was after hours for you.  Give me a call and let me know where you are with your gas supply negotiations and I will try to pick up where Laird left off.  Regards,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 I don't know if we want to do business with someone so unwilling to share information or provide guarantees.  Do you get any comfort from the information that you have seen or recieved?  Let me know what your opinion is.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Laird,  You can get prices from me any time - but you know I am always up for wine!!  Anyway, notional prices for Q4 at PG&E City gate are $11.65, 2 years out of  Jan., 2002 are $6.75, and 5 years out of Jan 2002 are $5.80.  Let me know if you need to do anything.  Also, what is your take on providing gas to all of these power plant developers.  I get at least one call per day from a different developer.  I am thinking that some of them will get built - for the state - but I can't determine who is worthy.  I have been short listed on PRMs RFP for Calpeak power, a sub of United Technologies.  They have no transport across Socal's or PG&E's systems (and neither do we) and United Technologies won't guarantee them 100%.  They said that they would provide "credit mechanisms built into the projects".  I asked what these mechanisms were and said that we take cash.  I haven't heard back!! Ha.  Kim 
 Barry,  FYI 
 I emailed chuck and told him we would be willing to take cash!!  I also just spoke with Ann Donnelly and she understands that if she wants us there, she will have to come up with something.  She is working on helping us establish the link between united technologies and calpeak as well as provide other info.  I will let you know what they come up with.  Thanks for your quick responses!  Kim 
 Are you going? 
 Chuck,  What would these credit support mechanism be?  We do accept cash!  Kim 
 How about lunch on Tuesday of next week - April 10th? 
 J. -  What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dave,  I think I mentioned this to you before, but I will also need the following attached to the ISDA:  1) duly executed tax forms ro certificates 2) evidence of authority to execute Master Agreement 3) specimen signatures (as to signatories to Master Agreement 4) financials 5) resolution to authorize execution of:  a)master agreement by specified parties and b)  all transactions under the master agreement 6) copy of  Articles of Incorporation 7) bylaws  ENA must provide the same documents to you.  You can ask Sara (pronounced Sora) questions regarding these documents once we get her on the phone.  Call me.  Kim 
 That would be cool - I get in at 5:59 pm on United from San Jose.  So how was napa?  I think that I need a napa trip sometime this year.  How was the place you stayed and where did you eat.  Did you buy any good wines?  What was your favorite? 
 Ann,  I just spoke with Jay Williams from our credit department and he only needs CalPeak's latest audited financial statements with management notes.  Any additional information that helps us understand the company and how it is set up will be helpful.  Sending this information overnight will probobly be our best bet.  My address is as follows:  1400 Smith Street, EB3206a Houston, TX  77002  Also, Jay's phone number is 713-345-3923.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Steve,  Attached is a draft copy of our master purchase/sale contract that we discussed.  Let me know if you have any questions - I will have my legal department standing by to assist.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 Barry wants to set up lunch or dinner with you while you are here.  Just let me know if and when you would like to get together.  K. 
 I came in late because of my back - I think I am going to go to a chiropractor 
 got it.  Thanks. 
 What was the price they sold it to them for?  Dave told me about this when he did it.  It is all interuptible and no power will be sold to PD in Q3. 
 I have sent drafts to Long Beach, Glendale, Roseville, and Salt River Project.   However, I havn't received drafts for Anaheim, Los Angeles, midesto, or Arizona Public Service.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Kent,  Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully, we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get ready to transact.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing by to help, too.  Thanks,  Kim Ward 
 Mike,  FINALLY, attached is the draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Let me know if you have any questions and if there is any thing else I can do for you -  Have a good weekend.  Kim 
 Laird,  City of Corona California planning for form a muni utility and purchase power generators.  Article in today's NGI.  Let's get 'em!  K. 
 Hi Manny & Jack,  Attached is our draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Once we get the ISDA signed and executed we can start on this contract.  It would be good to go ahead and get it in place so that when/if we want to do a physical deal, we won't have to worry about paper.  Did we get you everything that you need to go forward with the ISDA?  I will talk to you next week.  Have a good weekend.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Chris,  Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that Bonnie sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.  Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.  Have a good weekend -  Kim Ward 
 Chris,  The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as well, or when I fix the prices, do I need to add a new phys premium? 
 Darla,  This is what I have been able to find so far regarding fixed prices for citizens for Feb:  50,000/mo @ $7.55 50,000/mo @ $7.96 100,000/ mo @ $9.07  we also did a deal for 1,565/day @ $7.12.  Have they given you any information that you can compare this to?  Let me know if you have any questions and I will send you a spreadsheet with all fixed price deals I have done to date.  March and april should be final.  You can send me a monthly email when you are ready to do - say - mays invoice - and I will send you everything I have done with them.  Call me with questions -  Kim 
 Roger,  I don't know if you are the one to send this to but i am starting with you - let me know what we can do to take care of this EES customer.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Kathy,  Just had another moment to say hello.  How are you and how are things?  Still busy here - and I haven't even seen Robin - I think she has given up on me!!  In fact, I think I will call her when I finish this email.  At least I know I will see her in a couple of weeks when Chris and Katie come to houston.  Wish you could come with them - that would be fun!  Still working on the man situation - it was a topic of coversation amongst my friends last night.  I will keep you posted!  Hope all is well and keep in touch!!  Love, Kim 
 I got the agreement this morning but they misspelled Roseville!!  I am having them change it and will email it to you when I get it.  Do you want me to send you a hard copy or is an email version ok with you?  Let me know -  Thanks,  Kim  PS How are things? 
 Dave,  Sorry I am just now responding - I have been very busy and lost this email but found it today.  I am in houston working my tushy off and trying to get moved into my house.  My new numbers are 713-853-0685 (w) and 713-412-4571 (c) and 713-526-7117 (h).  How are things with you? your job?  did you guys end up moving - I can't remember.  Hope all is well - and I will do better about responding to emails!  Kim 
 Dan,  Can you send a template of the GISB agreement to this guy?  thanks,  Kim 
 Dan Hyvl - we sent them a draft two/three weeks ago. 
 Also, check the salt river project one. 
 Debra,  In the contract for Roseville, you guys have it spelled Rosedale 
 WEre these sent out to the counterparties or do I need to do that? 
 Chris,  Attached is a new spreadsheet with the PG&E, Large Packages Gas Daily prices.  This price is for the PG&E topock point.  It is VERY illiquid.  The desk is going to start posting prices for it on EOL in order to add more liquidity.  As you can see, there are days where there were no prices published for this point in Gas Daily.  As for Griffith, maybe PG&E topock should be the benchmark because Citizens truly doesn't have an alternative market.  Although they can change their primary delivery point to the border, the fact is that it probobly wouldn't flow because the line is already full.  Where can Citizens actually (not theoretically) extract the greatest value for this capacity?  I disagree with Griffiths comment that this price is more reflective of the market - what market?  Very little has traded there in the past.  One issue that we/Citizens needs to think about is hedging capabilities to PG&E topock.  I know when we were talking to them about our capacity, we priced it based on the SJ/Socal spread and they were agreeable to that.  But then again, we could actually flow gas to the border.  Sorry for rambling - 
 Congratulations on a healthy new baby!  Tyler is sort of a southern name - I like it!  As for me - I got a call last November to come back and market gas in the west.  I didn't think there was much going on out there but decided to go for it for personal reasons.  got here Jan. 2 and gas had completely blown out in the west.  So far, it seems like it was a good move for me.  My house in PDX sold in 4 days and I came to Houston between Christmas and New years and found a place here.  Still trying to move in as I can't get anything done during the week!  Just had new blinds put in yesterday.  Let me know if you are ever in town - keep in touch  Kim 
 Suz - here are the details -  Arrive in PHX Wednesday, April 11 @ 7:30 p.m.  Take a taxi to the Cottonwood resort  which is $199.00/night with two double beds and I think a fold out couch.  Suites with a hot tub on a private patio.  Lots of wine drinking.  No real going out but dinner at the Terra Cotta Restaurant one night.  Lots of spa treatments and sunbathing, and magazine reading.  VERY relaxing.  We leave sunday at 1:30 pm.  Call me and let me know if you want to go!!  Kim 
 Chris,  I can't read these - but my real quesiton is - If the $.07 is a demand charge and Grigsby gets $.04, we should still get the other $.03 because it will be charged on all volumes that CAN be taken, whether they take them or not - right?? 
 Dan,  Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard you!!  This one should be easy.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dan,  El Paso Electric's lawyer is Will Garant and his number is 512-495-8832.  He is the one dealing with our LT contract and is familiar with the collateral issues.  Matt Henry is the lawyer that drafted their long term contract attached.  I can get his number if you need it but I think he works at the same firm as Will.  Let me know what I can do to help and if you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help.  Kim 
 ok 
 Sara,  I am available all day wednesday but will be out of the office on Thursday.  Let me know when you would like to meet.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Lynn,  I thought you might be interested in the new draft proposal for the QFs in Cali.    Kim 
 I did make it home - and I managed to catch an airplane at 8:00 the next morning, have two meetings, attend a reception, and go to dinner.  Needless to say, I was very tired by the time I got home on Friday night!!  It was a fun week for me too - I got to see people that I hadn't seen in four years.  As for the weather, you aren't missing anything here this week - cold and rainy - just like portland!  Let me know when you're around - margaritas on a patio is always fun  Kim 
 Dan,  Attached is a term sheet that has been agreed to with the City of Pasadena to extend a current deal that we have with some minor changes.  Could you help me put together the confirmation?  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Attached is the latest term sheet for Pasadena for April through August.  Just wanted to share with you what we were going to be doing with them in the near term.  Ann, could you help me get this deal into the system?  PLEASE let me know if any of you have any questions.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Thanks Bonnie,  this is very helpful information.  Myself and/or Barry Tycholiz will be in touch with Chris very soon.  Thanks again,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 Dan,  Thanks for looking at this for me.  Could you recommend something not so awkward?  Sat, Sun & Mon would be the price published on Tuesday.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Dan,  Attached is some language that we are considering for a deal.  Could you take a look at is and give me the "legal" ok on it?  Or add to or Change it so that we are legally comfortable with it?  Thanks,  Kim 
 We leave for Scottsdale just two weeks from today. 
 THis looks good to me.  thanks,  Kim 
 Hey,  Go to the Enron home page and look for image center.  It should have everything you need and more for a presentation or enron "rock star" info!!  Let me know if it works for you!  Kim 
 I just got a cheesey email from George Denos - very funny!!  He wants to have margaritas when he returns to Houston.  I am laughing out loud!! 
 I can not mention how jealous I am about this trip - but here are some GREAT recommendations -  1)  Indian Springs in Calistoga, which is just on the north side of the wineries.  It has a spa and a huge mineral pool.  Also, the rooms are little bungalows.  2)  A more expensive option - which I havn't tried but comes HIGHLY recommended - Auberge du Soleil.  It has great rooms, a great spa, and great food and wine selection.  In fact, you can go to their we page @ www.aubergedusoleil.com.  You can't go wrong with either one.   Also, a restaurant that has been recommended to me is the Culinary Institute.  It is suppose to be awesome!!  The guys on the gas desk are going to cayman tomarrow - I am very jealous of that too.  Can you tell I need a break??  Let me know what you think of my suggestions - 
 MJ,  How are you?  It was good to see you when I was out there.  Things here are busy as ever!  I have some guy friends going to napa valley in a couple of weeks and they would like a recommendation for a place to stay.  I know you have stayed in napa before - do you have any recommendations?  I appreciate your travel agency services!!  I hope all is well and to see you soon.  Thanks,  Kim 
 Bob,  I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.  I hope that you will take a look at it.  Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.  Also,  I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.  Let me know if you need anything else!!  Thanks,  Kim 
 AS we discussed. 
 Call me - it looks like $20 is excessive - and I agree, the term sheet he put together is lame.  Hope these numbers are what you were looking for - 
 For your information, attached is the information that Long Beach has sent me regarding their historical load, pricing, etc.  I haven't gone through it yet but thought you should have a copy.  Kim 
   Call me if you have any questions!  Kim 
 Guys,  Attached is the latest and greatest term sheet for April through August, 2001.  Please let me know if I have addressed all of the issues we discussed.  If not, just let me know and I can fix it.  Also, for your KRS supply for April 1 -10, we are a Gas Daily minus $.50 bid.  For the 3500 fixed priced gas at the Border, we will pay Gas Daily minus $.10.  Also, for the EPNG capacity delivered to PG&E Topock, our fixed price bid is $2.10 plus variable.  Let me know what you think about these prices so I can get them in the system if we agree.  Also, call me if you have any questions!  Thanks,  Kim 
   I 
 Sara,  Attached is Salt River Projects ISDA attachments.  I know that we have previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and keep me posted on developments.  Thanks!  Kim 
 Jan,  Thanks for the email.  It is amazing what two days out of the office will do to my workload!!  I had two RFPs due yesterday - very busy!  I am going to work on our 'thoeoretical' deal that we discussed on Friday to see if there is anything there.  Hopefully, I can come up with something.  Thanks for the info on that.  Call me any time you want to discuss power - I will be glad to share with you what I know.  Thanks again for spending some time with us and hopefully we can come up with a good structure that is good for both of us!!  Have a good day -  Kim 
 The expense should have shown up on my hotel receipt and was authorized and approved by my boss.  This expense should be reimbursed. 
 Ann,  Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.  As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.  The options presented are not intended to represent a complete list of opportunities, but are representative of the different pricing structures Enron offers.  There are several additional structures available  and we look forward to discussing these options with you.  Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Thanks,  Kim Ward Manager, West Gas Origination 713-853-0685 
 Desk is currently looking at this. 
 Bonnie,  Sorry I am just now getting back - I was out of the office Thurs & Fri.  What I am trying to determine is the rate that Long Beach wants to beat and what it is made up of - so I would say both transmission and commodity prices.  Let me know if you have any more questions -  Thanks,  Kim Ward 713-853-0685 
 Are we still looking at June through Oct only?
