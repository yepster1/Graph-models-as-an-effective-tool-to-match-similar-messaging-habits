 Should we try Akin Gump?  What is your recommendation off the list?  Mark 
 Thanks, I will have my assistant call to set a date and time.  Mark 
 John:  Should we get you, Scott and me (and Teresa Bushman) together to flesh out the deal further for the term sheet?  Teresa and I have worked on a term sheet but it is pretty bare bones so far?  Mark 
 Louise:  I talked to Jim and we have worked through a revised strategy as we talked about yesterday.  So no call from Jim.  Mark 
 Dear John:  I am proud of MSU and would like to help.  I will ask my assistant to set up a time for us to talk through your questions over the next week.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke 
 I would love to, but I cannot.  Thanks for the offer.  You should be getting a call today from one of our lawyers re a potential deal.  Take care.  Mark 
 I am doing well!  I look forward to catching up.  I do plan to play golf so it would be great to play together.  Regards,  Mark 
 Very impressive.  Mark 
 Thanks for the offer, but otherwise occupied.  Regards,  Mark 
 John:  There is a conflict of interest in Thompson having all the info and selling to a group formed by him and other employees.  We need to talk this through.  Maybe, he should take a leave of absence.  Should Jesus negotiate the deal for ENA?  Selling to employees is sensitive now.  Mark 
 Jim:  I want to put Aronowitz for ENA as well as EGM.  He will get an assist from Sager but he will lead.  Mark 
 Who rejected your plan?  The view I heard is that the proposal was too rich.  Are you looking for a counterproposal?  Mark 
 Jim:  The last sentence was changed to "we expect you to perform".   Mark 
 Thanks for the offer.  I cannot use them either.  Mark 
 I don't know of any now.  Mark 
 It can wait his return.  Please ask him if he is available to speak on Dec 4 at the conference.  Mark 
 morale, deal flow, how the open plan is working 
 There are some more developments re Bob that we should talk about.  Mark 
 Mark, Justin, Paul: Do you have any comments on the agenda?  Let me know and I will forward them on.  Mark 
 It looks like a great program.  Mark 
 Look forward to the discussion.  Mark 
 Liz:  Greg is scheduled to speak on Friday, October 12 at 8:30 am for 30-45 minutes.  No slides are necessary.  The lawyers will be interested in where Greg sees the growth in the company and where the business is strong.  There will be Q&A and I think he will get some good questions.  Some possible questions:  What does Greg expect from the legal department?  How will the attacks impact on our business?  What will be his focus in his new job?  It should be a very friendly crowd -- since Greg knows most of the lawyers and they know him.  I miss you too!  Mark Haedicke 
 I am disappointed on the timing but I understand.  Thanks.  Mark 
 Thanks for inviting me.  I unfortunately will not be able to attend.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke 
 Did we talk about the cap on breakage fee? Mark Haedicke 
 Where did we come out on a cap on breakage fee? Mark Haedicke 
  Mark Haedicke 
 Thanks Derek.  Mark 
 Is there anything I need to work on tonight?  What is the schedule tonight?  Mark 
 Please handle.  Mark0  Mark Haedicke 
 We will get you a summary soon.  Mark Mark Haedicke 
 Clem:  Thanks for raising that question because it is very important that we are coordinated.  I have forwarded this question on to Jordan and I think he and I need to work together on this matter.  Perhaps the three of us should get on the telephone to resolve.  Mark 
 Coordination is a major problem at Enron.  You are asking all the right questions.  Mark 
 Sami:  Please set some time on my schedule tomorrow to talk this through.  Mark 
 I think it wii be about 7 or 8?  Dad Mark Haedicke 
 Justin, I do not think I am going to nyc.  Love Dad Mark Haedicke 
 Good luck.  I will email you later.  Dad Mark Haedicke 
 Rosalee:  Mark Taylor and I can get this done through Enron Net Works.  Thanks.   Mark Haedicke 
 I need to talk through our cash position for tomorrow at with our contingency team. I would like to do it today at 4:30 pm central time. Mark Haedicke 
 Congrats!  Thanks for your help.  Mark 
 no problem 
 I am ok so long as the firm would never pursue litigation against Enron -- on that basis I would grant the waiver.  Mark 
 Rob:  Congratulations!  We will need to talk about some additional coordination.  Let me know when is convenient for you.  Mark 
 I will call.  Thanks. M 
 Scott Tholan.  Regards, Mark 
 Not necessary.  Thanks.  Mark 
 That makes sense.  How do we notify our trading counterparties?  Mark 
 Yes.  I was very lucky to get back Saturday!  Mark 
 J:  Please add this to our spiral bound book.  Mark 
 Thanks.  Let's get together after the end of the quarter and discuss.  Mark 
 Looks good  to me.  Mark 
 I am stuck in London.  I will attend either in person or by video from our London office.  Mark Haedicke 
 I am stuck in London -- hope to get out  Sunday.  Nice to hear from you.  Mark 
 J:  Please forward this on to the Enron employees that plan events.  Shira is a family friend and I would recommend her.  Also give me a status report.  Mark 
 That sounds  positive.  Mark 
 Dave, in the Dunn Committee case, we just got a great order in our favor out of the courts.  We need to try to leverage off this order to slow down the AG.  Mark 
 Calpine in ok.  Mark 
 Thanks!  Yes, please keep me off the Section 16 list!   Mark 
 Greg:  It has been 120 days for voice mail that is not deleted.  It should be further reduced to 7 days.  Mark Haedicke 
 Thanks for the message.  Mark 
 Sounds like a great result!  Congratulations.  Mark 
 Andy:  Can you look into this while Richard is out of the office. 
 I will be attending.  Mark Haedicke 
 I have asked J to send it out.  Mark 
 J, please get this message ready to send from me to the Specialists.  Mark 
 Peter:  This is a tough battle.  It may be worse because your clients are either th= e same ones or geographically very close.  I would try to address it by poi= nting out the limitations of the simplier forms and as a fallback emphasize= the increased risk (legal and otherwise) when using the shorter forms.  Mark 
 Peter/Chris:  Have we put the updated netting language in the contract?  Would it ever come into play?  Regards,  Mark 
 Thanks Rob.  Mark 
 Mary:  The  company seems to have a bad reputation.  I don't know if Marc Rich owns any portion of it or not because it is private.  I think, the UK started some investigations re Glencore over the past couple of years.  I am not sure we want the company as part of ISDA.  I am sure others will have an opinion on that.  Mark 
 I agree.  Mark 
 Yes.  Thanks!!!    Mark 
 I want to go through a list of each counterparty we think is going to go into bankruptcy and what we are doing to prepare for that.  Thanks.  Mark 
 I am working on it.  Mark 
 Thanks for the kind words.  Mark 
 Yes.  They are fine.  Mark 
 Just do the best you can.  We will probably end up moving it to a different day.  Mark 
 Steve:  Per our conversation, I would like to talk about "Managing Legal Risks".  I think it would follow the RAC presentation.  I want to talk through the system of legal risk memos and legal risk ratings we have used on wholesale deals for two years with great success.  There is a very important risk control aspect to legal that needs to be highlighted.  Let me know if you need more information.  Regards,  Mark 
 Per our conversation yesterday, I propose we send out the following memo:  In order to better coordinate the various west coast power matters, effective immediately, Jim Steffes and Richard Sanders will jointly take the lead role.  Jim and Richard will be responsible for preparing a comphrehensive strategy for all the matters, reviewing the strategy with the California Committee and seeking approval of the California Committee before taking any material action.  Please do all you can to assist Jim and Richard on the west coast power matters.  I would copy only the people working on these matters including Steffes, Sanders, Belden, Mellencamp, Shapiro, Sharp, Williams, Tribolet, Lavorato and Delainey. 
 Thanks, I will send a copy to Alan in EGM.  Mark 
 J 
  J 
 fyi 
 Stacy:  I would like to know who on the committee is willing to spend time and resources on what issues.  I think that is critical.  Thanks.  Mark 
 put on my schedule.  Mark 
 We had a great time and got home without a hitch! Thanks!   Mark 
 John, thanks for the message.  I think, I would like to plan a trip and discuss the issues in person at GE.  Early October would work for me.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke 
 Mark and John:  The Wholesale legal conference is coming up soon.  I wanted to get a head count and the names of the attendees from each of you.  For planning purposes, I have assumed 5 lawyers from each of your groups.  Let me know.  Also, are there any European or South American topics you would suggest we cover?  So far, we have Whalley and Frevert signed up to give us a business update.  Regards,  Mark 
 Looks fine to me.  Thanks.  Mark 
 I have a few thoughts on the offsite.  I think we could have a theme of restructuring and change.  We would have to make sure it is forward looking and upbeat in that we have learned a lot that will make us better in the future.  The presentations could include the following:  1.   What we learned in CA -- Sager 2.   Preparing for workouts -- Mellencamp 3.   Lessons learned in international -- Lundstrom 4.   Deregulation of energy markets -- Kean/Shapiro 5.   Managing Legal Risks -- Haedicke 6.   Executives -- Frevert and Whalley 7.   Europe presentation 8.   Retail presentation 
 Richard is looking into whether we can tape in Houston or Portland and have a CA person on the line.  Mark 
 Lisa:  What is the quality of our contracts and do we hold any collateral?  Any particular legal issues at this point?  Will we have to get quotes?  Mark 
 Yes, so long as they are employees and not on contract.  Move them to Lance Schuler's group.  Mark 
 Let's discuss.  Mark 
 Don, we are looking into this.  I wonder how traders operate in LA.  Mark 
  FYI, Mark 
 Thanks for the message.  I would e-mail Alan Aronowitz.  Regards,  Mark 
 Sami, by copy hereof, I have asked Jeff Hodge to look into this matter.  He is at 36911.   Mark 
 Thanks Paul.  Mark 
 Thanks.  I will try!   Mark 
 I am ok as long as you and Alan are ok.  Mark 
 Travis and I will cover the suggested topics.  Mark 
 I will be on the telephone on this one because of a management meeting the same day.  Mark 
 I think it is something we watch closely as you suggest.  Mark

 My accomplishments for the first six months of 2001 include the following:  1.    Developed New EES Trading Forms -- provided key legal technology and intellectual capital to rewrite EES forms to be largely consistent with the wholesale trading forms.  2.   Developed Setoff and Netting Strategy in the PG&E Bankruptcy -- led legal and credit team across all Enron entities in minimizing Enron credit and legal risks.  This required an expedited evaluation of Enron positions and coordination across Enron entities to determine the best possible approach to terminate and then value all PG&E contracts.  3.    Implemented New Document Retention Policy for Microsoft Outlook -- led the resolution of many critical document retention policy issues and implementation of a new policy across company lines in Enron.  4.    Thought Leader on Legal Risk Managment -- continued to develop legal technology for better management and reporting of legal risks across Enron.  Legal Risk Memos and legal risk ratings are two examples.  These legal risk policies have been newly applied in South America and EES to better evaluate and manage the legal risks in those businesses.  5.     Developing New Businesses -- integral part in developing new businesses in freight, paper, steel, lumber, etc. by preparing trading forms and formulating new ways to manage legal risks.  6.     Deal Machine -- projects having lots of complex issues including LV Cogen II, Pastoria, Sithe, Invasion Energy, Electrobolt and Huntco.  7.     Management -- continued to build a deal-oriented legal team that understand the underlying businesses.  8.     New Generation of Master Agreeements -- taking the lead with ISDA in developing the next generation of trading master which would be a single master for all commodities, whether physical or financial.  This would reduce the legal work by half. 
 Please join me for a baseball game.  The Astros are playing the NY Mets on Wednesday, August, 1.  The game starts at 7:05 p.m.  Please RSVP to Janette by e-mail to let her know if you will be able to attend.  (Unfortunately due to the limited number of seats available in a suite, we were not able to extend this invitation to your spouse or significant other.)  Hope to see you there! 
 Elizabeth:  Does the RTO order require a task force to draft new language?  Let me know.  Mark 
 I am fine with the agenda except that I will have E. Sager talk about the trading forms.  Mark 
 Please review MEH presentation and send comments to MEH by 5:00 p.m.  May 12, 1999 via notes mail.  Thank you,  Sylvia T. Sauseda/MEH 
 Congrats!    Mark 
 Don, thanks for the feedback.  I am supposed to meet with Mike G tomorrow and I would like to chat with you after that meeting.  Hope things are going well.  I will give you a call.  Mark 
 I would be happy to meet with her, but is unlikely we would be able to sponsor a junior lawyer.  It does not work well in our business.  Let me know if you want me to talk to her.  Mark 
 Yes, I would like to go.  Let me know the time.  Mark 
 Can you cover this? 
 Thanks Justin. 
 Ok to talk to him, I just don't want to get his expectations up.  Mark 
 Thanks. 
 Gay:  It is nice to hear from you.  I hope things are going well.   Merry Christmas!  Mark 
 Let's talk about it, but some sort of a consulting role seems appropriate.  I guess it would be less hands on than usual.    Mark 
 Thanks for the update.  Mark 
 Alison:  I think the energy panel at the AGM on March 17, 2000 in Amsterdam should discuss (i) development of energy trading on the continent, (ii) energy documentation issues and (iii) regulatory barriers to energy trading.  This is a great time to do a panel on energy trading in Europe!  I will copy Paul and Justin in London to get their ideas on both topics and panel members. Perhaps we can have a conference call next week.  Mark 
 1.  Enron Online Trading -- organized a legal team and solved enforceability and documentation issues around the world in a few short months for all the commodities traded by Enron.  2.  Developing New Businesses -- major contributions in developing and structuring coal, insurance, band-width and power plant transactions.  The groundwork has been laid to develop very profitable businesses in each of these areas.  3.  Aggressive Pursuit of Litigation Claims as a Plaintiff -- pursued Carolina Power & Light , Shell/Meridian, TVA, Ft. James and many others. Most have already settled with excellent results.  Successfully defended Wolfschlager, the last Panhandle case and Jolen.  4.  Lead Power Industry to Develop Master Power Agreement -- ENA lead the Edison Electric Institute coalition in developing  the first master power agreement.  ENA will benefit greatly in terms of dramatically lower transaction costs and greater liquidity.  5.  Reduced Legal Costs as Percentage of Earnings -- brought overall legal costs to less than 6% of EBIT in 1999, down from 8% in 1998, despite the upsurge in origination activity.  6.  Brought Finance and Corporate Legal Talent to Origination Deals -- as the origination work expanded dramatically and became much more complex, brought in more sophisticated legal talent to deals like UI and Peoples with great success.  7.  New Concept to Better Manage and Communicate Legal Risks -- developed the legal risk book concept to highlight where the largest buckets of legal risks were and where efforts should be focused. 
 Please try to schedule a call with Justin and Paul in London and  Alison at ISDA over the next week or so.  Mark 
 MIchael:  I will be over for the ISDA board meeting on January 25 and 26.  With the launch of the credit derivatives business, I think it would be a good time to do a brief Securities Law/Chinese Wall seminar relating to the credit business.  I would propose to review the rules we have instituted in NA and particular issues in the European market.  My preference on timing is in the morning on the 26th, and second, in the afternoon on the 25th.  Please give your thoughts on this.  Take care.  Mark 
 FYI, we need to talk about a presentation in the London office on Chinese walls.  Mark 
 Thanks for the comments.  I will make sure Tana gets taken care of.  Mark 
 Please put this on my calender. 
 John:  I will get on your calender in January when I am over.  It is also my understanding, for the credit trading business you are developing, that Chinese walls are not necessary.  But it will be necesary to address if equity trading starts up.  Also, there are probably related issues, like restricted lists and the like, that could apply to credit trading.  Hope you have time to enjoy the Holidays.  Take care. 
 please respond 
 Michael:  I think it is an excellent idea to keep count of the number of ISDAs we have as a way of focusing attention on our progress.  I think it may be a good idea to get a paralegal secondee from A&O or Linklaiters.  That secondee could then help with overflow work after a return to the firm.  Mark 
 Robert, have you been able to get Alan's comments?    Mark 
 I have noticed it!   Mark 
 This was the right Monday, so next Monday was the OGC anyway.  Mark 
 Let me know if there is anything else I need to do right now.  I would think we would want to set up a conference call as soon as we have identified all the panel members.  Take care.  Mark 
 Please prepare this letter for Cliff's signature.  Mark 
 I have listed a few pertinent facts about Jeff for your upcoming meeting. Let me know if you need more information.  1.   Jeff joined ENA Legal on September 1, 1993.  His title is currently Assistant General Counsel.  2.   Jeff leads a group in the legal department that focuses on physical trading.  Jeff spends most of his time on structured deals like Brooklyn Union and physical gas trading.  He also has lead the legal team on acquisition deals such as Columbia Energy Services.  He has a strong work ethic and an excellent record in closing important transactions.  3.   He has good legal judgment and is described by his clients as a knowledgeable and practical trading lawyer.  4.   Jeff has consistently ranked "excellent" in the performance review process. 
 John, I can make it on this coming Tuesday.  Mark 
 Anita:  Thanks for your note.  You made a great contribution to the Singapore office and I thank you for that.  Have a happy new year!  Mark Haedicke 
 Gareth:  Thanks for that note.  Have a happy new year!    Mark Haedicke 
 Ernest:  Happy New Year!  Is it too late to call on behalf of your wife?  I was swamped in December and never got to it.  Let me know.  Take care.  Mark 
 Ken:  This looks fine to me.  Where do we go from here?  Mark 
 Thanks for the memo.  Regards,  Mark 
 FYI 
 The name does not sound familiar to me.  Mark 
 Please give me an update so we can get this done.  Mark 
 Happy New Year!  Thanks for the message.  I will check on this asap.  Mark 
 By copy of this message, I ask Janette to help Mark out with his request. Please have Mark stop by.  Mark 
 FYI 
 I hope it comes true!  Mark 
 Calpine was going to take assignment of a contract with LCRA and backed out on the agreement.  We can talk about it more when I am in Portland on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Take care.  Mark 
 I will bring some to London as you requested.  See you soon.  Regards,  Mark 
 FYI 
 Thanks for the info!  Mark 
 Bob: I am fine with your proposed endorsement language.  It was great to see you last week!  Mark 
 OK 
 I am working on a plan to increase our bench strength in trading.  Wtih bandwidth, EOL etc., I think recruiting additional lawyers to do trading legal work is critical.  I will give you and Michael a call over the next week or so.  Take care.  Mark 
 My e-mail address is changed to mark.e.haedicke.enron.com 
 Julie, great to have you back!    Mark 
 Mary, by copy of this e-mail, I am asking Justin how big a presence National Power is in energy trading.  It seems to me National Power is more analogous to a dealer than a subscriber.  Mark 
 How big a presence is National Power in the market?  Are they analogous to a dealer?   Mark 
 Welcome!  Please stop by.  Mark 
 Let's talk about it.  Mark 
 I will be in Tokyo next week working on the start-up of energy trading in Japan for Enron.  I would like to book time on your respective schedules to meet on Wednesday afternoon.  I have some flexibility in my schedule if that does not work for you.  I will be in Tokyo on Thursday and Friday too.  Look foward to hearing from you.  Mark Haedicke 
 Having dealt wih Manfred on a number of matters I have to say I am not surprised.  Scott, please get personally involved in selecting a Punder lawyer that will take his place in meetings with customers and regulators.  I don't want to lose control of legal to John T in Germany.  Let's hire a lawyer on the ground if we need to.  Let me know.  Thanks.  Mark 
 Do we want to talk to him again?  If yes, Jeff, please give him a call.   Mark 
 Sorry, I can't make it.  Mark 
 Thanks for your note.  I think it is easiest to contact Julia Murray and Lance Schuler.  Please call me at any time.  Mark 
 Mary:  I think National Power should be more than a subscriber member.  Mark 
 Dear Terry:  Thanks for your quick reply.  Wednesday at 2 PM works for me.  I would be happy to come to IBJ's offices.  I will be joined by two others on our team. I would propose to discuss the prospects and challenges for energy trading in Japan.  Let me know if this is OK with you.   Look foward to seeing you.  Regards,  Mark 
 Richard:  Looks good with one change:  please delete the reference to honesty -- it's a little too tough.  Mark 
 Martin:  Thanks for the update.  It sounds overall like the direction will not be negative to our business in any material way.  Is that correct?  How is the weather?  Mark 
 Alan, have you looked at these opinions for Japan, Korea or Singapore?  Are they helpful?  Let me know.  Mark 
 Bill:  Let's try to get together today or tomorrow.  I will be out next week.  Also, give Lance a call and get on his schedule.  Look foward to seeing you.  Mark 
 It is my understanding that it is ok with Jim and Elizabeth if Janette attends and works at the conference.  If that is correct, I am ok with her attending.  Mark 
 KMM:  I believe MEH needs a photo for HBA Pictorial.  sts 
 Terry:  We are meeting our accounting firm for lunch so we are not available.  Thanks anyway.  The address I have for IBJ is 1-3-3 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku.  Is that the correct address of your office?  Let me know.  Regards,  Mark 
 Travis, could you please spend a few minutes on this and respond to Steve Wallace?  Thanks.  Mark 
 Joe:  I think there are several positive things to point out.  ISDA is opening an office in Japan as of April 13.  They have already hired one person and are looking for addtional people.  More importantly, Goldman moved one of its top traders worldwide, Tom Montag, from London to Tokyo and is generally beefing up the resources in Japan.  IBJ has contacted me about energy trading and asked for copies of confirms and says there is growing interest in the market place.  That's all I can think of for now.  Take care,  Mark 
 next time! 
 Paul:  Thanks so much for your help.  I think the legal team you have made available to us is very impressive.  I look foward to our success in Japan.  I have authored many articles on trading in markets around the world.  Would anyone in your shop like to work with me on energy trading  and documentation in Japan?  Mark 
 Mark:  I will be in Amsterdam for the ISDA board meeting on March 15 and 16.  I would like to get an update on the APX before leaving for Amsterdam.  For example, do we think it will be successful?  What kind of volume is trading? Also, I wanted to get your recommendation on what law firms or maybe the APX that I should visit while I am there.  Hope things are going well.  Regards,  Mark Haedicke 
 I am sorry for ISDA that Mark Harding cannot run for Chairman again.  I will give you a call.  Is Montag willing to do it? 
 Seth:  I thought last week was very productive.  I appreciated your help.  The ISDA office in Tokyo is set to open officially on April 13, 2000.   Yasuko Horibe, who is currently in the ISDA office in NYC at 212-332-1271 is planning on moving to Japan to open the office.  Give her a call and get more details. Get back to me if you don't get the info you need.  Rgards,  Mark 
 Per our conversations.  Give me a call.    Mark 
 Mark, give me a call.  Mark 
 No, but I am ok with it.  She is doing a great job.   Mark 
 Please provide your comments to me as soon as you can.  The most important thing at this point is to make sure I have the business correctly described. I am working on the letter of intent now.  We will have to decide how detailed you want the term sheet and loi.  I would think you would want it fairly general for your first few meetings until we get feedback.  Let me know.  Mark 
 There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant, Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso.  The idea would be to talk about e-commerce in the energy business.  Specifically, Enron might propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.  We would probably discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.  What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting? What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting? Should legal counsel be in attendance? Would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter? 
 Jeff, please review and let's talk about it.  Mark 
 Mark Haedicke requested I forward the attached drawing. 
 Thanks, please work with Travis as I asked to take the lead on developing the conference.  Mark 
 Thanks for the feedback.  Mark 
 I think we need coordination on all plant matters.  Mark 
 Talk to Janette and let's get a few other people.  Mark 
 Paul:  I think we should have a brief meeting of you and me and Lance Schuler to plan out a strategy and then direct Raisler.  Let me know if this sounds ok to you.   What do you think is driving the change of mind?  Regards,  Mark 
 Seth:  There is a new senior person that was just hired in Japan to be the head of the office.  You should find out that person's name and try to meet with that person in Japan as soon as you can.  I think Enron should try to steer one of the committees to focus on energy regulatory matters in a material way.  I am not sure what committtee that would be at this point.  I think you should have this conversation with the senior person and I will work on it at the board level.  Let's keep comparing notes.  Regards,  Mark 
 John, thanks for the feedback on Mark and Scott.  Regards,  Mark 
 I am ok with all the changes except the deletion of the last sentence in paragraph 1.  I don't understand why Abitibi-Consolidated deleted that sentence.  Mark 
 Tim:  I am preparing a list of the pluses and minuses for the three main alternatives of Settlement, Hearing and FERC.  I think it will be helpful to channel the discussion.  I will send it to you later today.  Mark 
 In the attached chart, I have listed our three main options, and the pluses and minuses, from my point of view, of each option.  Let's discuss this tomorrow. 
 Attached is the chart for Bigtoe. 
 At this point, I think they should be a subscriber member, since trading of paper is an emerging market.  Mark 
 Sorry for my tardy reply.  I have been covered up.  Thanks anyway.  Mark 
 I am not sure.  The numbers do look reasonable to me.  See if they are ok with Sheila Walton and would fit in with our standard policy.  Mark 
 fyi 
 We have not talked about this.  Mark 
 What's going on?  Where are working now?  Mark 
 1.  Legal Risk Report -- developed the concept of the legal risk report for ECT.  I began reporting and managing the ECT legal risks on that basis.  This resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract risks.  There will be many coll
