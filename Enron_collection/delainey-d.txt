 Guys, here are the details on the ESA MEH turbines - please forward to me your project details, economics and strategy ASAP.  We will allocate these turbines to the project with the best strategic/economic rationale once confirming that they are worth more in ENA versus ESA.  If you need more detailed information on these turbines please let me know.  Rob, please give me call on this one.  Regards Delainey

 Mike, can you keep the approval amount under $20M? Regards Delainey 
 Paul, thanks for the note.  Please clarify the following for me:  break out 2001 property premiums ($3M) for each major ENA asset ie) peaker, the ponderosa facility, LV Cogen and HPL/Hanover assets et al.  Wes, can you confirm for me that no insurance costs are embedded in the teams 2001 plans.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, Dave Duran agreed to reduce his plan to flat year on year for commercial expenses - can you reflect that in your sheets please.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and 2001 IT budget.  Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will be managed.  Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, any ideas?  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please set up a time for us to speak -- Bruce sorry for the delay - life has been a little hectic.  Don't ever hesitate to call, just have patience.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, can you send me hard copies - I am having trouble opening these reports.  Any summaries on the RTO filings?  Regards Delainey 
 The Strategy Meeting previously scheduled for tomorrow, November 14, 2000, has been cancelled.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call Kay @ 713-853-0643.   Thanks,  Dave 
 Jim, is there executive summaries for the following: a) Eastern Interconnect investigation  by region; and b) RTO's filings.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I think we should pass on the sponsorship of this event.  If you have a different view, lets discuss at your earliest convenience.  Thanks Delainey 
 Keep pushing these guys.  Regards Delainey 
 kay, see when this is and if I can go?  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal?  Regards Delainey 
 David, I don't know if you are the right person to speak with; however, I am looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related cost allocations to ENA for 2001.  We have been given allocation projections that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.  I would like to know how this was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions.  If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you please pass this on to the right spot.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Are you in? Time is a wasting..... Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, duly noted; however, there will be at this point no change in the scope and function of Redmond's group.  Thanks Delainey 
 Tim, lets not worry about margin at this point - we are trying to get a handle on headcount and direct expenses/capital charge first.  You will have your day in court to discuss margin soon.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, any help would be appreciated - we are very well positioned in the Florida market at this point.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget. Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks.  Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes.    Regards Delainey 
 Ike, sorry for the delay, it took us longer to deal with certain issues than expected.  I have faxed you a proposal.  Lets discuss at your earliest convenience.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Brian, good memo.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like you to consider the following people to provide the basis of your producer marketing team.  They are being re-deployed out of the upstream services group and have significant experience and relationships in the producer services market segment.  They can provide mid-market coverage, producer outsourcing, well-head purchases, etc.  As per our previous discussion, these folks will be your producer team and will provide all ENA's products to the segment.  Please keep this confidential - but please speak with Jean Mrha.  The names include: Linda Roberts - director - lead the central region; Mary Jo Johnson - manager - central region (wait until post HPL sale);  Jill Zivley - director -  lead the east region; Gary Bryan - director - east region; Jennifer Martinez - manager - east region; Bill Brogan - manager - east region; Kreg Hall - analyst - east region; Brian Riley - director - east region (wait until post HPL sale).  Both Brian and Mary Jo are inside HPL and if sold would interview with the buyer first and then would be available for ENA - lets wait on these folks until post sale.  Lets make a strong effort to accomodate these folks given their experience and availability.  Regards Delainey 
 Christi, please provide me with a timeline of when you expect to be filing protests against each utility.  As well, please ensure that both Kevin and I sign off on the filing before it goes out.  Regards 
 No Meeting This Week   This is a reminder !!!!!  There will NOT be a Friday Meeting November 10, 2000.    Date:  November 10, 2000  (cancelled) Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Dorie, as per our discussion.  For the Friday night speaker, can you give me an idea of price and availability for the following:  - Joe Gibbs - Lou Holtz - Mike Krzynewski - Joe Paterno - James Carville  The topic would be leadership and motivation.    Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I assume that you will have a complete headcount and a revised 2001= =20 expense/revenue/capital budget available in the next week or so.  I would= =20 also like to know what your HR plan might be given these changes.  David=20 Oxley will the help with the HR issues and Wes Colwell with the budget issu= es.  No turning back gentlemen.

 Kay, can you handle this stuff for me. thxs  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, great job - the Canadian office is still the model.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, fyi 
 Mark, fyi and between you and I.  Rob will always do the right thing - he is just a little more passionate than the average Enron guy.  Keep trying to build those bridges.  Regards Delainey 
 I stand corrected - we need to DASH everything over $500K.  Regards Delainey 
 Jane, we would like to go the Adjustment of Status route.  Regards Delainey 
 Great job - we all appreciate your management of the situation.  The A&A program is our most important asset.  Regards Delainey 
 Great job guys  - keep it coming!  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control. Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc.  A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish some of these goals as well.  In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a reasonable cut-off before this turns into an All-Employee meeting at the Hyatt.  John and I decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large visable budgets.  In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg for mid market and yourself for origination.  I hope this rationale will manage your issues.  If we invite Jake I think you do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room.  Lets discuss. Regards Delainey 
 John, this is a Skilling issue - Charlene and myself are going to talk to him about several changes in the next couple of weeks.  Regards Delainey 
 Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the company we would be a $100 stock.  On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.  I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.  The goals of any restructuring are: a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the program; b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained; c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling and interviewing; d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly grounds the associate in the "Enron technology" which include skills in market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk; e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues; f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, retention and performance tool; g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, non-traditional sources of talent and h) increase cost effectiveness.  The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, people and teams, business tracks, etc.  I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.  I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with a strawman.  Let me know your thoughts.  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, thanks for the letter on Friday.  The team is preparing an analysis on where we have flexibility and preparing a response.  We should be able to respond before the end of the week.  Thanks Dave Delainey 
 David, i agree in principle with this process.  I assume that you and your team will implement.  Like we spoke about, I do not see a need to widely distribute this through the commercial organization.  I would just implement.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that we are reaching these goals.  Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we watch the funds flow issues.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please forward to Max Yzaguirre.  The e-mail failed.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please forward to Scott Josey, John C Thompson and Julie Murray.  I could not find them on e-mail.  Regards Delainey 
 I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.  Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following: a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately; b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance.  Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.  Other identified action items from the meetings include: a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the July 19th meeting; b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to continue rotating within ENA; c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area; and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.  Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.  Regards Mark and Dave 
 Guys the PRC has been moved to 11:00.  Regards Delainey 
 By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted.  We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing, our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.  Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.  We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a success.   Sincerely,   Dave 
 This is a reminder for you to please take a minute and select your reviewers for the PRC feedback.  Dave is also requesting that you provide a list of accomplishments for the past six (6) months.  Please provide this information to your direct reports as soon as possible.  Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call Kay  3-0643.   Thanks,  Kay      -

 MEETING CANCELLED FOR FRIDAY MAY 19, 2000   This is a reminder !!!!!  There will not be a Friday Meeting today, May 19, 2000.  Date:  Friday May 19, 2000  Time:  2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location: 30C1  Topic:   Combined Staff and Budget Meeting   If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643) or Bev (3-7857).  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Chris, Rob Milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the opportunity.  I would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks to meet Rob in Calgary to speak in detail about the role, the market and expectations.  I appreciate your openess and let me know how I can help.  The Ontario market is one of the best new market opportunities for ENA over the next year.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as part of the new A&A program being rolled out by the ENE Office of the Chair, a new Associate and Analyst PRC is being set up.  I have nominated you as the six people from ENA to be on this PRC.  You will represent ENA's A&A's and participate in the evaluation and ranking across the entire company.  This is a very important function - please represent us well.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you help Phillip out with this, I assume this has something to do with the 20/20 deal.  I believe a reserve should have been set up for this payment which was only designed to ensure that the transaction was accretive to NBPL.  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, great letter and arguement, I think the more public we can be on this one the better.  Thanks Dave 
 Gregg, please send a hard copy - the pdf file can not be opened on ENA systems in Houston.  Thanks Delainey 
 Jeff, as per our discussion, this would be a great opportunity for you to spend some time with and instill your vision for Enron to the leaders of the ENA organization.  I have attached a preliminary agenda which has you speaking to the group right after dinner the night of December 14th.  You have no time constraint on the length of your talk (ie) whatever you find find appropriate in order to get your message across.  I though it might be interesting for you to give your vision of Enron's 2001 goals, objectives and strategy.  As well, a brief business overview of EES, EBS and Networks may be valuable in building connections.    Regards Delainey 
 Please plan on attending and presenting.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, e-mail didn't pick up your name. You are invited as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Here you go.    Sorry, I have Enron Messaging working on it...But here you go for now..... 
 Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite. As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.  ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.  Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.    Regards Dave and John 
 Guys, updates to numbers given discussions at QBR's.    Regards Delainey 
 pls, forward these to Tammy Sheppherd to incorporate in the ENA OOC reports.  Regards Delainey 
 sound good mark thsx dave 
 Fran, can you speak to Brian on this issue.  Regards Delainey 
 David, thanks for the people listing.  Wes, we need 1999 and 2000 (including CE) ESA income statements for each market in as much detail as possible.   Looking for un-necessary overheads and where the income brightspots lie.  We would probably need the ESA 2001 budget (income, expense, cashflow and capital) for the trading/marketing/EES business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats.  A current balance sheet would be helpful as well.  I think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us.  You need to get your Visa issues worked out quickly - Kay can help.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim,  what ever you think is appropriate.  As far as the weekend, lets just play it by ear.  At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following discussions/agenda: a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & historical prices and volumes; b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation strategy; c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product development; and d) brief review of other S. American markets.  I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and any one else you think appropriate.  Let me know what I need to do otherwise.  Thanks  Regards Delainey 
 Looks good.  Regards Delainey 
 D'Arcy, sorry I missed you last week. I am going to be down in Rio mid November for some meetings with the S American team. Maybe we can have a discussion then?  I would very much like to get your opinion.  Regards Delainey 
 Colleen, thanks for the update - as another part of the nat gas value chain, traded transportation, with and without EOL should be a priority.  However, I think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the FERC that will allow the market to work.  Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately.  Thanks.  Regards Delainey

South America is going home & they are off tomorrow ----Thank= s,=20 kay   On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio= n,=20 announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20 operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha= t=20 are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b= asic=20 organizational framework has been set.=20  As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new= =20 responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and= =20 Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting= =20 to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility= ;=20 however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20 commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus = will=20 be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal= l=20 country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE= O=20 of Elektro until its ultimate sale.  The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20 Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in= =20 Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark= =20 Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a= nd=20 Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our= =20 reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20 managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset= s=20 are pursued.  The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20 America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo= rk=20 business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20 commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu= e=20 products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and= =20 enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.  In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report = to=20 Joe and Orlando: =20 The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will= =20 focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine= =20 natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:  ? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services= =20 needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20 capabilities; ? Providing those products and services across South America and across the= =20 value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value= =20 opportunity; ? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move= =20 quickly to capitalize; ? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20 overall risk of the organization; ? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri= ca=20 consistent with this strategy, and ? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de= al=20 flow.  The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w= ho=20 work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,= =20 capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio= n,=20 finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20  The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The= =20 team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book= =20 for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale= s=20 efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel= y=20 trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible= =20 for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct= =20 reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ= as=20 risk activities.  The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20 Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we= =20 will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. = =20  The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati= on=20 that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20 functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea= m=20 and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20 Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20 units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as= =20 well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20 infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements= =20 in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.  These groups include:  The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20 manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as= =20 governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate= ,=20 in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20 functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20 assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th= is=20 interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator= y=20 function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20 Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.  The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t= he=20 interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20 current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi= ll=20 also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20 assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the= =20 Cuiaba project.  The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and= =20 John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal= =20 requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20 Wholesale Services - Legal Department.  Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20 Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil= l=20 report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial= =20 functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20 relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron= =20 Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale= =20 Services =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.  These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20 reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20 financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new=20 organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20 region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly=20 affected will be notified shortly. =20 Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20 businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we ar= e=20 uniquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20 shareholder value.=20

 No Meeting This Week   This is a reminder !!!!!  There will NOT be a Friday Meeting October 27, 2000.    Date:  October 27, 2000 Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Guys, attached you will find the updated orig plan for Q4.  Trading income is slim pickings so far ..... we need some key deals of all sizes to close in the fourth quarter from your organizations.  Thanks Delainey 
 Tim, that will be fine.  This is a discussion topic that I want your input on for next year.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, don't worry about me - it worked out fine.  Just a bad day on the P/L side.  Thanks for leading some of these efforts it is often a thankless job.  Regards Delainey 
 sounds like a great idea  delainey 
 Guys, I spoke with Mark this morning.  He is very supportive of the structure and idea.  I had indicated that he would continue to run the producer services business in the West but would also be part of the overall team as we plot out strategy in the West.  He wants to stay in Denver which I think we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into the overall team.  I had indicated that we would consolidate market making into Houston and Paul Lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or not - if so he needs to move to Houston.  Phillip/Barry, go ahead and start working with Mark as you develop your plans going forward.  I will be speaking to Stephanie Miller this week and will give the green light with her shortly.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I would start focusing some attention on gas at this point.  When we get together I would like to sit down and go through a number of organizational re-alignments and what we may want to do on the regulatory front to support those businesses.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi  Dave 
 Barry, I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week.  I would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators (internal or external?) to complement.  I would start thinking about how to get that done.  I would call Oxley for help if needed.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, lets get together in the next week or so to discuss progress.  In the meantime, what are we doing with regard to FERC 637 to ensure that we have favourable rules in the trading of natural gas transportation capacity?  Do we have a master summary of the RTO proposals submitted last week?  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however, assuming a fixed amount of the "internal" legal costs are fairly represented by this allocation as ENA's "capacity" charge, you are correct.  This number will be in the P/L under your name.  The "outside" legal costs should be tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I need an estimate of the quarterly "capacity charge" for ENA and an estimate of outside legal costs by business unit.  Regards Delainey 
 David, can you point D'Arcy in the right direction in ENA or ESA.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, anything you can do to encourage your employees to take a little time to participate in the survey would be much appreciated.  This is a valuable exercise for the company.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, if you or any of you people have interest in attending please contact Wendy Roy.  Regards Delainey 
 fine 
 Strike One!  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, reference to a) below has to do with the legal budget.  Sorry for the lack of clarity.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, couple of points - a) please check spelling and typos closely and b) in the first paragraph of the second page starting "The Commercial Origination...." should end with ".... knowledge necessary to reach our goals."  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, hold off until I let you know to go.  Thanks dave 
 Guys, notes from the morning meeting.  Please review and comment.  Specific action items: a) i)further calculation of ENA/Non- ENA capacity charges, ii) estimation of outside legal and iii) formulation of charge out/feedback process to the business units; b) need budget/review for competitive analysis, technical and restructuring.     Regards Delainey 
 Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible to get this out of either the trading or origination group.  As a significant contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room. Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely linked to specific legislation or policy.  This may not be the answer you want; however, I am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, I would let this fish go.  He has been through the organization too many times.  Regards Delainey 
 Rodney, if this deal is such a long put why did you push me into this process?  You should have made the call to kill it.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find the final plan to meet our origination targets for Q4 consistent with our discussions.  It is important that we hit our numbers in order for Enron to meet its targets for the year.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your capabilities better than ours.  In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric contract.  The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW of power.  I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP controls in the nation.  The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.  I spoke to him yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.  Joe is a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.  It may be a good lead into the health care segment.  Regards Delainey 
 Eric, as per my discussion with Rob, I believe that the site has the most value to us given its location and capability.  I would continue to actively develop that site for a variety of turbine technologies.  As far as the turbines, I would probably exit them in the most opportune manner.  Regards Delainey 
 REMINDER -----TODAY 3:00 PM   Dave would like to have a strategy meeting next Tuesday  October 17, 2000, from 3:00-5:00 pm in room 30C1. No preparation is necessary and it's important that each of you plan to attend.  If you cannot attend, please contact Dave directly.  Laura - Video Conf.  Frank Vickers - - Video Conf. Barry Tycholiz--  Video Conf. 
 Guys, what is your plan?  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board meetings and PRC's.  Lets set up this discussion with the following points: a) we are not exiting Argentina; b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business opportunity; c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision making and greater communication; d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao Paulo.  Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina - its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business model we are trying to move forward.  Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and Orlando as part of this process.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA point of view.  The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project. The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M. the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, venture capital and the "organizing group" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.  Regards Delainey 
 Rodney, from what you told me it sounds like GE is willing to play on the Selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed.  Can you answer Marty's other questions?  Regards Delainey 
 Marty, no agenda on this one at all.  Given, the change in Enron Industrial Markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on the outsourcing product, I just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.  I believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other priorities they would like to transition the deal to EES.  Ultimately, the value (TCV, earnings, up-sell, resume) would benefit Enron more in EES than ENA.  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, what is the cost basis in these turbines?  Regards Delainey 
 Jana, I had a late request from the Portland team to nominate a person, I don't think that Janet would mind letting them nominate this person.  If I am incorrect Janet let me know.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter or so.  Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some value for Enron to take this deal including: a) $200 M in TCV for 2000; b) $3 to $5 M in value; c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the large industrial customers; and d) provides an "in" to the GE family of companies which could result in significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick, I have signed the DASH. Good job.  One comment, the DASH for Basic particularily the RAC comments was very poorly written.  Please keep an eye on this for me.  Regards Delainey 
 John, I don't get it - are they trading gas and power.   I thought this was= =20 your group?  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, please provide Jana with your choice of person ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, do you have a home for this guy - he desperately wants to stay in S. America.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, it is all yours please communicate ASAP to Jana Jovanni in the A&A program.  Regards Delainey 
 This is a reminder that your QBR has been scheduled for  Monday October 23, 2000.    Date:  Monday October 23, 2000  Time:  9:00 - 11:00am  Location 3321  Topic:  QBR    If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.   Thanks,  Kay 
 This is a reminder that your QBR has been scheduled for  Monday October 23, 2000, in conf room 3321. Please be prepared to discussed:  A) QBR l.  Portfolio Review-Raptor/Non Raptor   B) 2001 Business Plan    If you have any questions/conflicts, please feel to contact me at 853-0643.   Thanks,  Kay 
 Guys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $100M in nominal value): a) 2 power barges - Brian - $13M b) 2 ABB 11N1 - Rob- $35M c) 1 501D5A - Janet/Chris - $25M d) 1 7EA - Janet/Chris- $20M  All other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects. Could you please provide me your plan with these units.  I would like to flatten out our book (ie) ensure there are good homes for or divest of all our existing turbines before we look at purchasing additional units for 2002.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, what is the status of this turbine - would we be able to turn it back in exchange for foregoing on the ld's?  Or do we want this turbine?  Regards Delainey 
 David, do we need to "volunteer" people to participate?  Do we want a more structured process?  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 FYI 
 Guys, what is this!!!!  No - I think that Ahlstrom should take this risk or it should be reflected in a price reduction. I vote not to do the deal otherwise.  Regards Delainey 
 Please mark on your calendars to attend given current discussions about the gas organization.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, please mark your calendars for the 2000 ENA Management Offsite scheduled for December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  We envision people flying in the afternoon/evening of December 13th with the offsite being held on December 14th and 15th.  Departure would occur the morning of December 16th.  It is important that everyone stays for the entire period including Friday night.  Jeff Skilling and Greg Whalley have taken time out their schedule to speak to us on Thursday and Friday night about Enron Corps strategy and our eCommerce/Networks strategy respectively.  A complete agenda will follow shortly.  Dorie Hitchcock will manage all the logistics.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick, you are doing the right things - if you run into timing issues in the future do not hesitate to give me a call directly.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I'm not picking on you - I just can't believe legal and corporate let this go through. Sorry.  By the way, Redmond will take responsibility for the Pan Nat arbitration as per our discussion.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, do you have a deal book -explaining the overall transaction, returns and risk?  This will help me facilitate the process.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I completely disagree with legals position.  I have difficulty with some of our VP's having signing authority.  I believe this is a significant control issue.  Mark, is this widespread in ENA?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the Hot List for each business unit.  The performance of your group is key to making our targets for Q4 and to meet budgeted origination performance for the year.  Independent of specific budgets for the groups, the origination organization needs to generate $250M for Q4.  Ultimately, a strong performance in Q4 by the origination organization will help build momentum into the year-end PRC.  I will be setting up time with each of you to go through your numbers and specifics on the deals.    Regards Delainey 
 sure, just set up with kay  thxs dave 
 Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.  In order to reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups and managers have very low participation rates.  I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80% participation (ie) the "unhappy" folks are more likely to input info than the "happy" folks.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, hopefully we can convince you to come when we re-schedule - seemed like an easy call.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, he can approve but can't sign as a director. You need to continue to manage. This would take a board resolution to change (ie) he can not bind the company as a director.  Regards Delainey 
 Please be sure your are in attendance or let me know if you can't attend so that I can make Dave aware.  This is a reminder !!!!!  There will be a Friday Meeting October 13, 2000.    Date:  October 13, 2000 Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Rick, I have been having discussions with both Joe Deffner and Jean Mrha on this one.  Clearly, this is a commercial banking product in which we have little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or collateral (reserve risk).  Ultimately, I have challenged the Upstream Group to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave would like to have a strategy meeting next Tuesday  Ocotober 10, 2000 from 2:30-4:30 in room 30C1. No preparation is necessary and it's important that each of you plan to attend. If you cannot attend, please contact Dave directly.   Thanks! 
 Ike, is the president and CEO of TVA.  FYI  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective communication tool.  I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are going.  Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Jeff, can you speak briefly with Kevin on this one - intriguing idea if the execution was probable.  By the way, what is our plan with Sithe?  Regards Delainey 
 Rick which meeting are you refering to?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, it will be very difficult to get money out of the power group - is the expectation that I come up with the dollars - just curious.  Are we not circumventing the spirit of the political contribution rules?  Regards Delainey 
 I am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting.  I just think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with families.  The drive to Galveston and back - the overnight babysitter - the potential trouble that may result in close quarters and hours of drinking et al.  I prefer the original idea at Enron Field.  Regards Delainey 
 Kevin, how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company?  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas and power business.  Rather, my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and generate deal flow.  As well, to reduce the conflict between the trading and origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the market than focused on internal issues.  As far as specifics, you will have to wait and see.  Thanks Delainey 
 Chris, you are officially the king today!  With the PSCo deal this effectively eliminates the LM position assuming we successfully sell LV.  Regards Delainey 
 Oz, David is interested in the fuel cell business, do you need his skill set?  Regards Delainey 
 Erin, don't want to keep passing the ball;however, this is a retail opportunity in almost all states (ie) railroad demand is classified as retail customers under most IOU tariffs.  I would ask Harold Buchanan  Regards Delainey 
 Sounds reasonable. 
 Charlene, the 2nd is ok. Either Mark, myself or John should probably be able to do the 28th as well.  Obviously, we strongly believe in the benefit of the program and its goals - ultimately, we  have to walk the talk! Regards Delainey 
 Charlene, that will be fine... on a different note, where are you on the straw man we spoke about.  Ultimately, I would like to continue to push this with the leadership team.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you forward your parts.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, no hi or goodbye - you are losing your Canadian politeness :)  On a serious note, you are doing the right thing for the company and for Barry's career.  This will be a good opportuntity for him to get to the next level if he makes it happen.  As you are aware, I will aggressively support you and the Toronto iniative. Let me know.  Regards Delainey 
 Updated draft memo.    Regards Delainey 
 Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility? Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated structure in the RFP?  Is this a play that you would support?  On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.  How is it going otherwise?  Regards Delainey 
 Marion, the leads include Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan in the Eastern Origination Group and Michael L Miller in the Principal Investing Group.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical feedstocks into industrial gases.  He wants to establish the technology in Baytown and is looking for our assistance and capital.  This is probably a stretch but it may be worthwhile for you to speak with him.  I am not advocating this play just passing on the message.  Steve Paras 718-630-5611  He will be in Houston on Friday.  Regards Delainey 
 Mary, none outside of Enron plans.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, this sounds like an ambush..... :) 
 Guys, assuming that we receive $7M for the 6B's what is our cost basis in the Barges?  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I am not sure that this will attract the people we want to hear the message; however, I will hold back judgement until we discuss the strategy in more detail.  Regards Delainey 
 Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the current deal on the table is a bad one.  I believe that RAC should provide a clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient.  It is too easy to state the obvious.  Regards Delainey 
 David, you may be getting to the nub here.  Ultimately, this is a lot more art than science.  It will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision rule to manage this process.  I am looking to the opinions of yourself, Ray, Dick and Jeff, given the facts in each case, does this appear to be a good trade given the market, the specifics of the company, the carrying costs of the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return assets (ROCE >25%).  This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that comes from this group.  As a result, I need to have a positve consensus from this group in each case.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?  My understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.  Is this correct?  I may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie) no more 6B's or barges.  Regards Delainey 
 Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.  Regards Dave and John 
 David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH. Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given the possible recovery of this sector?  The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy prices.  Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?  Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, I think we should take a quick review of the existing PI portfolio to see where we are and where we want to go - we have with the completion of FCEL made a tremedous amount of investment in a very short period of time >$60 to $80M.  I would like to  hear how we are moving to monetize more mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage investments.  I don't want to approve any further investments until we have had such a discussion.  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday; but I understand your position.  In the interest of facilitating continuing dialogue and perhaps giving you our view on how we analyze such positions, I will send you our document.  I would suggest that we try to set up a follow up meeting in early October once you have completed your work.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 This is a reminder !!!!!  There will be a Friday Meeting September 29th, 2000.    Date:  September 29, 2000 Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Guys, can you give me an update on what this deal is about - e-mail would be fine?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, how are the business units doing on the "talent pipeline" since we have put this on auto-pilot?  Is HR still providing resumes?  Regards Delainey 
 Bruce, obviously ENA does not have a problem with this.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, this sounds good.  It would be helpful for us (the overall power business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.  I think we all believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and rewarded.  Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions and origination; and d) EOL customer sign-ons and deal flow.  I look forward to sitting down to discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 John, completely agree with your view - David, I would have the matrix, with all of the ENA statistics and names, ready for distribution on Friday to the key managers to try and illicit a response from the low participation folks.  Regards Delainey 
 ok with me 
 Guys, please take a read of the draft memo - would like to send out tommorrow.    Regards Delainey 
 John, I think you may want to be part of this.  Regards Delainey 
 Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I think it works welll in allocating resources between competing "going concerns" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly effectively.  Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of time on this.  Regards Delainey 
 Thanks 
 Chris, as per our discussion, I just want to confirm that we have the ability to break the contract with the EPC provider at any time.  Further, I want to confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the short run value of the project.  In other works, we have no intention of lifting their offer.  Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines.  These guys add no value and they are killing me!  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA could create significant value from a project that we have very little invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant dollars or taking significant risks.  Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.  Regards Delainey 
 Krista , you are very welcome - best of luck in the future.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I have forwarded your binder to David Oxley to set up a meeting for the wholesale group to discuss appropriate homes for your people.  It has taken a little longer than expected to get people together but we are making progress.  It may be helpful for you to identify, like Abe, where these folks would like to go if they had their druthers.  It may be worthwhile for us to have a quick phone call to discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Ok - you got the ball.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, part of this deal is repayment of the sub debt at par and a series of cashflows that we would probably like to monetize.  Have you looked at this?  Jeff, I would like to get your view on the economics - basically they are giving us 89% of our carry value in cash and 11% of our carry value in a contingent payment payable at restructuring or sale of their partnership. Lets discuss ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 good job - keep them coming!  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, can you set up a dinner with Randall.  Thanks 
 Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on Wednesday.  Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so that we can ensure that we are comparing "apples to apples".  I would also suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers. It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties settlement offer.  I am in the office over the next several days. Lets discuss at your earliest convenience.    Regards Dave Delainey 
 Christi, I was unable to open the file can you please send a hard copy.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits: a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues they are having with GE and b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission correlating into increased operating hours.  I need two things to determine if we want to move forward: a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?  I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.  Regards Delainey 
 Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology. Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value or multiple value based on 90 degree output.  I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.  The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.  My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.  Regards Delainey 
 Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real knowledge of the potential deal.  Likely this originates at the local level and is probably a long put.  Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more detail over the next week.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as usual the investment is subject to RAC review and a DASH.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward under the structure we have discussed.  FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that vest based upon 60MW of orders; - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that call; - the transaction is fully press released immediately.  CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW; - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.  I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.  Thanks Delainey 
 Guys, HR should be in touch with you with regard to a couple of people that I have agreed to take from CALME:  Donahue  - Maria Elena Garcia - Director; Duran   - Boris Feschiev - Manager; - Mark Provenzano - Manager.  Regards Delainey 
 ok 
 This is a reminder !!!!!  There will Not be a Friday Meeting September 22nd, 2000.    Date:   Off Week  Time: Location:  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 FYI 
 Randall, I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved. It was a pleasure to meet you and your team.  The several things on my radar screen with Bridgeline include: a) improving the financial performance of the entity; b) ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure matches ENA's technology, structure, systems, accountability and policies in every manner.  In my view, this is not a negotiable item and will only benefit Bridgeline on a go forward basis; c) continue to move from the "heavy lifting" approach to becoming the "smartest pipe" that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your people, your information advantage and I believe somewhat of a first mover advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors (ie) Entergy/Koch/FPL. We will be very supportive of innovative and aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined; and d) increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in Bridgeline.  My time and resources are at your disposal.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, agree with you - why don't you set up some time for us to speak and go through the Regulatory report and iniatives.  Regards Delainey 
 David, on a go forwards basis, please ensure that there is a technical sign off on the principal investments DASH.  I would like either Bob Virgo or Wayne Mays to have a look at these investments from a technical due diligence point of view and to be on side before the investment is made.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will better reflect my thinking around this investment.  The current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in the fund.  I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:  It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is important for the following reasons: a) provides an additional "Friend of Enron" to facilitate short to medium term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity and capital transactions in the wholesale group; b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.  ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.  Regards Delainey 
 ???? 
 Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating. In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.  Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the East.  Regards Delainey 
 pls set up 
 ok if Mark is ok.  Regards Delainey 
 You caught us .... 
 Don, NewPort Generation has called me interested in the plants.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI Lets discuss Regards Delainey 
 Mike, this appears to be a very reasonable settlement - proceed on this basis.  I assume this keeps my number in and around the $600 to $615MM for the 2000's all in.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please find room 
 Good note - don't think I could do better in style or timing! Regards Delainey 
 Jeff Ader is looking for a reserved parking spot.  He is presently parking on the Blue level and would like to have a reserved spot due to his frequent traveling and customer appointments that warrant his leaving the building, thus loosing his parking space.  Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  Regards,  Kay   3-0643 
 Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not execute the gas balancing arrangement.  The parties should continue to operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute the agreement or put it in the data room.  We should represent to potential buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market.  All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities (including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, FYI - Ben, can you follow up with this person with our interest or lack thereof whichever is applicable.  Regards Delainey 
 Successfully, missed another bullet !!!  I have meetings set up with Mariel= la=20 (the lady you like) and Dan Castingnola, who are the two highest ranked=20 performers in CALME, to see if they are interested in joining our team. =20  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, gas with a $5.00 handle is not a good thing for this deal - I know we are pushing this restructuring as fast as we can; however, I think we need to determine how to move this faster. Any ideas?  Regards Delainey 
 Jennifer, is there another time?  Regards Delainey 
 Tom , I appreciate the e-mail - sorry for the delay in response.  I am on-side with all your points.  On the New Albany retrofit, I want to ensure that I am not replacing one patent problem with another so a clear "title" up front on the new equipment will be important.  However, I will be interested in hearing your solution especially if it can further reduce NOX and increase our operating hours.  I share your interest in the FT-4 project hopefully we can take that to the next level.  Please stay in contact.  Regards Delainey 
 Tammy, are you getting all these reports?  Regards Delainey 
 Jen, I would be pleased to attend - sorry for the delay on the e-mail.  Kay, please set up.  Regards Delainey 
 David, how are we making out with this item?  Regards Delainey 
 Carol, I believe Hunter is leading the charge on building the gas fundamentals group.  Regards Delainey 
 David , if this is going to cause you political flack with Mary Joyce lets just kill it - we have revised the original plan and this is probably not needed.  Regards Delainey 
 Janelle, I was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your thoughts on your current role.  I have heard you are considering global fuels and Lagrasta's business.  I would like to give you my perspective on the future vision for power and the overall organization including gas mid-market.  Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the primary growth engine for Enron Corp over the next several years.  Kay, can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience.  Regards Delainey 
 As per our discussion. 
 Kay, can you set up a one hour to half an hour with each if possible.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Guys, ENA will take responsibility for the two 7EA's.  We do not currently have any projects for the Westinghouse 501D5A's.  However, I do not know what Bowen's view might be for EIM or Haug's for CALME.  Regards Delainey 
 Patience my friend - before a meaningful change can occur in the A/A program some of the changes in the EI groups need to be resolved.  That process is underway - I envision taking a comprehensive solution to Jeff towards the end of this quarter with Charlene on side.  I will discuss with you when I have more details.  Regards Delainey 
 Attorney-Client Protected  Kevin, If we respond to the RFP with what we believe to be market prices and values and they don't accept it - does that not support a case where damages from the MOPA , for that 500 MW, can be defined to be equal to or lower than our submission.  Regards Delainey 
 Rick, it looks like the number is approximately down $198MM.  What is the drill?  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, go ahead and set up the meeting.  Delainey 
 Kevin, shouldn't we participate in this RFP? Regards Delainey 
 I don't think we can accomodate that request.  :)  Regards Delainey 
 Don, give Harry some $$'s Regards Delainey 
 Chuck, I appreciate the note - I just like to ensure that everyone is aware of the various issues and that we are managing our risk appropriately.  I have a great deal of confidence that you have this handled.  Regards Delainey 
 It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:  Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other departments Recent successes and current projects Ideas on the horizon Opportunities in your business unit for AA's The benifits of rotation in your business unit An open Q&A session  These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between 12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.  Dave 
   The meeting for Friday September 1, 2000 has been cancelled.    This is a reminder !!!!!  There will Not be a Friday Meeting September 1, 2000.    Date:  Friday September 1, 2000   (CANCELLED for this Week)  Time:  2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location: 30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643) or Bev (3-7857).  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable. The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.  The benefits include: a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, Capstone and Elektryon; b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer applications; c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk; d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology did not work or the market did not materialize; e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology; and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.  However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.  Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause at a fixed number for their 50% .  If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I will set up a meeting.  Regards Delainey 
 Hey, you guys are copying my model!  Congrats  Regards Delainey 
 Barry, we currently have six folks coming who all golf:  - Barry - Lavo - Delainey - Ozzie - Milly - Yzaguirre  I would say we should golf everday. I will get Kay to forward travel schedules to you so that we can set up times where everyone can play as much as possible.  My understanding is that we are all staying at the Mirage.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an interim authority, expires today.  Given current market conditions, I would request  an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an additional two weeks starting today.  Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the winter season.  I will take your lead on this one.  Regards Delainey 
 thanks Ray  Delainey 
 Kay, please book 9:00 am to 2:00 pm with me Mike Miller & Don Miller with Mike Childers (Entergy) (actually 10 am to 1pm not including travel time to their shop in the Woodlands) on September 5, 2000.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you come explain some of this to me including where we stand on the GE issues.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, great job - looking for more. Regards Delainey 
 Ben, any thoughts? 
 Rebecca, I am fine with this; however, Lavorato has was spelled wrong.  Regards Delainey 
 Tammy, are you getting copies of all these reports for the book?  Regards Delainey 
 Adam, thanks for the response, I guess it is a good thing for Enron that we didn't do this deal with TXU.  Nevertheless, I hope that we can find a way through this without significantly impairing value for ENA.  The ENA team will work with you on this item;however, I need your committment to try and keep us whole as much as possible.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, keep the pressure on these guys; but, I think Adam is in a corner and does not have a lot of flexibility.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca, looks fine to me.  Regards Delainey 
 Just a reminder, the East Midstream QBR will be held tomorrow....  DATE:   AUGUST 24, 2000 TIME:    1:00 PM TO 4:00 PM PLACE:   EB 3321 TOPIC:   EAST MIDSTREAM QBR  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact either Kay (3x0643) or Beverly (5x7857).  I will look forward to seeing you there. 
 Steve, I appreciate the offer - I  hope you didn't have to promise your first born since I was basically giving you a hard time.  I may take you up on this next season.  Regardless, I appreciate all the good work you and your team are doing.  Regards Delainey 
 This is the original memo sent to all the committee members from Dave.  I then sent out another one cancelling the Staff Meeting for all those not included in this memo. I also sent out a memo regarding the newly formed ENA Management Committee,  including the assistants,  so everyone would be on board.  Let me know if this isn't what you needed.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten.  I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction with ENA versus TXU.  I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I expect high quality service for the money we are paying.  The deal on Friday is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of service.  I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other business lines.  If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy.  I make money you make money.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Regards Delainey 
 Paul, sorry for the delay in responding, I do not have a direct relationship with anyone in Reliant or TXU; however, Jim Ducote and Janet Dietrich may be the best spots in Enron to pursue.  Regards Delainey 
 Adrian, you are very welcome  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, that is correct. See you then Regards Delainey 
 Guys, we appreciate your efforts on this project but we will not be needing your services as owners engineer on the Vitro project.  I will honor our agreement on the sell down; however, we have sufficient technical talent internally and externally to manage this job.  I see very little effort in continuing to waste internal time in ENA and EECC on this discussion.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, I thought I would send you a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR to give you a view on what Presto/Baughman are doing.  The West historically has been far better than the East in covering the market and generating mid market deals/services.  I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week.  I would like to get a perspective on organization, market approach, deal flow, resources, products and coverage for the Mid-Market group at that meeting.  Regards Delainey 
 David, I would change John Thompson and Ed Baughman to strong. Thxs Delainey 
 Guys, we need your final review on next years budget (direct expense) for MW Gas (Luce) and LT Gas Fundamentals/Transport Capacity (Gomez) done today.  We are running out of time to finalize the budgeting process.  I would much appreciate your assistance.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, lets discuss just after Wayne and I get together to discuss the technical book or in conjunction.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, where are we on gas interconnect?   I am hearing rumblings of 15 year Kern exposure - don't  know if I like that.  Regards Delainey

 Dave has reserved a Plane to take all of you to Las Vegas for the Offsite, December 13th.  We have no idea  what time the PRC will be over; however, at the conclusion of the PRC everyone should plan to go straight to the Hanger to board the aircraft.  I just got confirmation last night that I have the plane, so I really don't have any details at this point.  As soon as I get the information, I will make packets for each of you with directions to the hanger.  We are asking that you make your own reservations for the return since everyone will be leaving at different times.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.  Thanks,  Kay  3-0643 
 Ben, can you spend a little time and give me some feedback on this item.  Regards Delainey

 Guys, my suggestion would be that RAC should manage the overall monitoring responsibility for ENA;however, I assume that Janet and Chris will continue to be responsible for the ENA turbine book.  They should be actively managing and monitoring ENA's piece.  Regards Delainey 
 John, if we invite Scott then I think we have to add Eric Thode(PR/IR); however, everyone would be in!!  What do you think?  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, can you make sure I am available 
 This is it.  So sorry I left you name off.  Kay 
 Staff & Budget Meeting has been cancelled.  Please make a note on your calendars. A new committee has been formed "ENA Management Committee".  A memo will be going out with the attendees and with the times.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.   Thanks,  Kay 
 This is a reminder !!!!!  There will be a Friday Meeting August 18, 2000. This meeting replaces the every Friday Meeting and will be held every other Friday.

 Mark, this is great - giving the increased exposure/politics in some of these markets it makes a lot of sense.  Regards Delainey 
 As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on this Friday.  Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire meeting and to be on time.  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, I am in favour.  Regards Delainey 
 Wayne, that would be fine.  Regards Delainey 
 Please note time change for the QBR to be held on Friday, August 18th.  It will be from 8:30 am to 11:30 am so that we can have the Friday afternoon budget and staff meeting.  The QBR will be held in EB3321.  Thanks. 
 Guys, this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group. I think this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.  We need to bring more people "in" which should increase their accountability for ENA results overall, improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to evaluate future leaders.  Trading   Origination  Country Managers  Support   Executive  Belden    Dietrich   Milnthorp   Colwell    Frevert Presto    Calger   Yzaguirre   Beck    Delainey Arnold    Duran       Oxley    Lavorato Neal    Bowen       Haedicke Shively    Donahue      Murray Allen    Mrha Martin    Redmond  I would like to send out a note this week to communicate whatever we come up with in order to have the right folks available on Friday.  Look forward to your comments.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.  It is not a bad model just a different one.  Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall Street.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, any thoughts - do we have excess development staff - this would be a good opportunity for the brave at heart.  Regards Delainey 
 Just a reminder.....West Mid Market QBR will be held this week:  DATE:   FRIDAY, AUGUST 18, 2000 TIME:   1:00 PM TO 4:00 PM PLACE:   EB3321  I will look forward to seeing you there.

 Guys, I would like to schedule a quarterly meeting to review our technical risk as a part of this reporting procedure.  Wayne can you set up a meeting for the four of us over the next few weeks.  Regards Delainey 
 Pretty quiet on the EcoGas/Kafus front...... whats up?  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, thanks for the message. It has been my experience that people who have had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and manages risk.  Personally, this is the track I took which included a very solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then ultimately in origination.  I hope this helps.  Regards Delainey 
 Bill, Dave delainey is only recieving mail through david.w.delainey@enron.com. I checked in the address book and it appears as though he should be able to recieve email from david.delainey@enron.com. This is happening fom external accounts. I have checked his settings and everything seems to be fine. Could you please take a look at his mail file. If he can not recieve email through david.delainey@enron.com, can we make it to where he can. Please reply this back to Kay Chapman and myself.  Thanks, Joe Brewer 
 thanks Ben - makes sense.

 Rob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC. Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.  My view is that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals. The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia Lakes.  All other industrial business other than P&P commodity/asset business is the perview of ECC.  Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the deal structuring/due diligence queue.  The US group can help get these done and can help in the pitch.  Regards Delainey 
 I agree 400% - I look forward to your plan. 
 Larry, my understanding is that ESA has taken four units and that Janet Dietrich in conversations with ESA has made four more available to ESA subject to them getting their deal approved by the board.  So I do not believe Enron needs to committ to additional LM units at this time.  Regards Delainey 
 How do like that ..... I like this guy. 
 Let me know your thoughts after you speak with him.  Regards Delainey 
 Fred, I will research our potential needs otherwise I agree with your approach to keep the option open for as long as possible.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes:  a) P&P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination; b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron Mexico; c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in Houston should provide a winning team.  I am asking for the three teams to clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer (ASAP).  I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.  Either way, I am expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for Canada and Mexico; and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to ECC.  Regards Delainey 
 The following meeting has been arranged:   Date:  August 4, 2000 Friday  Time:  1:00 pm - 2:30 pm  Location: EB 3314  Topic:  HLP  Attendees: Mark Frevert Dave Delainey John Lavorato Wes Colwell Tim Detmering Brian Redmond   If you have any questions/conflicts, please feel to call me.  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Jeff, we are thinking about how to finish the mid-market iniative and I need to know if you want Breslau.  I would like him in a singular role and accountability so I need to plan to incorporate him or not depending on if you want him.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please have Jordan forward this in hard copy to your attention.  In don't need to be in the e-mail loop.  Thanks Delainey 
 Charlie, your call - just a question 
 please put on schedule 
 David, I want to enforce this to nth degree given his understanding of our industrial offering and that fact he mis-represented his reasons for leaving.  Regards Delainey 
 Edward, you are very welcome and I appreciate all the efforts to ensure the transition works and we get the accounting treatment we want on Garden State.  Regards Delainey 
 Shocker! 
 fyi 
 Charlie, looks pretty general - only comment is what is the Product Purchase Agreement entail? Do we want to go into more detail on the nature of the alliance, the target market and the nature of the excusivity (ie) wholesale renewables applications, ENA, major state programs - all of it based upon the Conneticut job working?  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, as per our discussion, I wanted to detail the action items from the analysis: a) the Office of the Chairman will be increasing the visibility of ROCE and cost metrics as a part of the QBR process; b) the ROCE iniatives include: - HPL divestment - Donahue/Detmering/Redmond; - GENCO strategy or possible peaker sales - Donahue/Miller; - MPR rationalization, Raptor strategy and divestment/clean-up - Donahue/Maffitt/Peterson - LRC optimization, increased performance - Redmond/Mrha; -Sithe restructuring, elimination of the tracking account - Donahue; - Powder and Wind River sales - Redmond/Mrha. c) specific cost reduction iniatives as detailed in your presentation - implement with feedback/measurement process to ensure buy in - Wes Colwell; and d) further analysis on quality of product/service for cost for non-commercial and group expenses - Wes Colwell.  Regards Delainey 
 Due to a scheduling conflict, it has become necessary to cancel the dinner meeting scheduled for August 2, 2000 at the River Oaks Grill.  This meeting will be re-scheduled at a later date.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact either Kay (30643) or Beverly (57857). Thanks very much. 
 Rick, we have re-examined the portfolio as a result of our last meeting and have an expected portfolio of $500M (gross) or $408M (net-ENA's share) to be placed into Raptor on September 1.  We have a second tranche of $608M (gross) or $396M (net ENA's share) to be placed into Raptor 2 on December 1.  Kafus, Ecogas, Brigham, Crown Energy and Merlin CLO Equity Option will not be part of either Raptor 1 or Raptor 2.  Please confirm that this is consistent with you view of capacity and timing.  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, great job - I would really like to get this done for third quarter please let me know how I can help.  I have heard that you can request a expedited HSR for fairly straight forward deals like this.  Wes, I believe that we don't have any issues recognizing the value from this transaction - please confirm.  Regards Delainey 
 Jennifer, you are very welcome and I look forward to continuing to work with you - all the best.  Regards Delainey 
 Dawn, right now I am scheduled to be up in Calgary on the 16th of August - lets shoot for that date.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca, if you wouldn't mind I would like to sit in on the Monday meeting. I think that Mariella from what I have seen and heard is very capable.  I strongly believe that we need to put a dedicated (with fresh eyes) SWAT team on this one that has control of the complete commercial, technical and financial aspects of this project.  This is the only way to be effective. Whether it is with you or me or both, I am indifferent  I would like to ensure that Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzales and Alberquerque are not buried in this project given other goals and objectives.  Thanks  Regards Delainey 
  THERE will be a Friday Staff Meeting July 28, 2000.   Date:  Friday July 28, 2000  Time:  2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:    Combined Staff and Budget Meeting    Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Mark, note the feedback from the AA's, it is imperative that we get a handle on this!  Let me know when I can spring our plan on Jeff.  Regards Delainey 
 I have just received word from Ted Bland that no one has responded to this memo.  Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.  Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.   As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.  We are presently working on a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA regarding A&A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.  In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead  for your groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&A's in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x39233) or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our A&A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&A resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.  In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&A matters. We will confirm the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply their name as soon as possible.  Please call with any questions. 
 Kay, make sure Mark knows when you are scheduling these QBR's so that he can ensure the package is ready - some of these are coming up next week.  Regards Delainey 
 Rick, I hope you take the time to speak to Rodney Malcolm or Ray Bowen on how your technical and commercial exprience could help move the outsourcing product (in all its forms) forward in the industrial market.  Otherwise, your welcome ...  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, if you Janet or Dave can cut the deal with Izzo go ahead and speak to him.  I don't think there is any practical way to enforce any percieved call we have on Izzo so you will have to determine how much Larry really wants the trubine or how he could benefit from striking a different deal.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I would forward to Chris Calger, Janet Dietrich and Jean Mrha.  Thanks Delainey 
 Laura, I spoke to Tom about his retail proposals, I told him that you would coordinate a meeting between Mark Muller/Lou Pai and himself.  I only want Lou going up if Tom is involved.  However, Mark Muller is up to go and I have spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today.  He is expecting your call.  On a related note, I volunteered Wes Colwell (our controller and former Anderson person) to speak to Peoples accounting/ risk people and Anderson auditors on how to manage the issues surrounding marking the hub values inside Peoples.  I would appreciate you coordinating that meeting.  If Wes goes to Chicago, we want to ensure Leubbers, the Anderson folks and the appropriate Peoples accounting folks are available so Wes can spend the least amount of time on this issue.  Jeff, where are we on the PECO/PSEG retail play that you spoke to Mark Muller about a couple weeks back?  Mark, I forgot to mention that FPL is interested in potentially investing in the New Power Company - Tony Altman (President of FPL wholesale) would like to discuss.  If interested please call him at 561-625-7777.  If you don't think you will have any interest let me know and I will call him to let him know.  I probably need to get back to him either way shortly. Thanks.  Regards Delainey 
 I am trying to pull together a QBR for Dave and Mark Frevert.  Would Tuesday August 29th from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm. work for everyone?  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 FYI 
 Eric, Jim Ajello in the industrial group is the best person.  Regards Delainey 
 Please follow up if appropriate.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI 
 I think we have the wrong date and time on this one - the Upstream QBR is August 28th for an afternoon. Regards Delainey 
 Jordan, I assume the memo I asked for is in hard copy on my desk. Thanks Delainey 
 Guys, lets set up a meeting between the three of us on Monday ASAP to discuss.  I have a few ideas and I probably need to go have dinner with Lew to get him comfortable.  This may be setting up to be a larger asset management transaction.  Don can you try and find a time next week with Lew for me to have dinner - get Beverly to schedule the plane to get me in and out that day.  If not next week then early the following.  I think it will take a one on one with Lew to get this one centered.  At our meeting, I would also like a status update on the other iniatives eg) Ameren, DPL, Cinergy, etc.  The accounting issues on the generation projects need to be addressed as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, please have the detailed HPL numbers available to discuss on Monday.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, my team believes that there should be a premium to book in the range we quoted to you; however, I appreciate your interest.  I would agree that we have spent enough time on this and it is time to move on.  Regards Delainey 
 Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is questionable.  I vote to kill it.  Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with my partners.  Regards Delainey 
 Unless asked just bring your smile.  Regards Delainey 
 I'm already perfect :) 
 There will be a meeting on Wednesday, August 2, 2000 from 9:00 am until 10:00 am in Conference Room EB3321.  We will be discussing the Triple Lutz and Trantula Projects.

 Don, go ahead and set it up - what have been discussing with them on the gas side?  Did CSFB tell them about the $400 Kw capital cost plus the three year transistion agreement for $4.00 kw/m?  Tell Beverly or Kay to make time for next week if Mr Forster can make it.  Regards Delainey 
 looks fine to me  regards delainey 
 Janet, its your book - if you feel we have the LM's licked and we need the resources/the value at risk is minimal, I would go ahead.  I would get Calger on side as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Good job Rodney - keep me up to speed and let me know where I can help.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.  Regards Delainey 
 Don, couple of points: a) would take a page to describe the Bridgeline structure (ie) we have done this before; b) haven't we done more that 150,000 transactions? c) we are getting paid a fee for providing the back-office services?  Let me see what you come up with after discussing with Presto et al.  Regards Delainey 
 Rodney, interesting title- is someone giving you grief on this strategy?  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, please follow up with Dorie she will handle the process for you.  Regards Delainey 
 Whats's up with these machines - are we paying for past good luck?  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, I am not aware of any questions.  Regards Delainey

 Thank you for your prompt responses, the following QBR HPL/LRC/Upstream Origination date has been confirmed:   Date:  August 28, 2000 Monday  Time:  1:00 pm - 5:00 pm  Location: 3321  Topic:  QBR HPL/LRC/Upstream Origination    If you have any questions/conflicts, please feel free to call me.  Thanks,  Kay  3-0643 
 Wes, we have the following dates set up: a) East Midstream and QF Restructuring - Aug 15; b) Industrials - Aug 14; c) Canada Origination - Aug 16; d) West Midstream - Aug 17; e) HPL, LRC and Upstream Origination - Aug 28.  We are setting up the remainder as we speak.  I have some final comments on the packages you gave me; however, the color printing will not fax so we need to find time to discuss.  Please fax the Friday "package" and the final Q2 numbers.  Regards Delainey 
 David, I wouldn't do the Brown Bag (too often- too hard to keep doing); I wouldn't do the Social Gathering (too country clubish); I like the Monthly Dinner/Cocktail Hour/Ballgame, etc with the OTC and parts of the management team as a forum to identify talent, give A&A's exposure to the management team and to "sell" ENA. I would suggest that we make it every two months rather than monthly. However, I would have the first one very quickly for the top rated A&A in ENA that are due to rotate soon in order to try and pitch them on staying in ENA - maybe dinner and ballgame.  For the resource management and coaching part of the program, lets wait until we see where we end up on any possible changes to the program first.  I assume that you are working on a couple strawmen on possible alternatives. Once we have a few ideas, I would like to pitch Whalley, Sherriff and Mark when I get back.  Lets go ahead and implement above ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, did we get the DASH completed and approved on Pasotria and LV Cogen?  Rob, I have not heard what the plan of action is with Moore?  Rob, what would be the necessary steps needed to book all or some of the Bruce deal in Q3?  Regards Delainey 
 Please plan to attend a meeting Friday, December 1, 2000 at 7:00 am in Conference Room 3321.   Date:  Friday December 1, 2000  Time:  7:00 am  Location: Conf Room 3321  Topic:  Review of Tex-Mex Deal for Board Approval    If you will be travelling and need to call in, please let me and I will set up a dial-in number.  Feel free to call me with any questions.   Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Guys, where is Rebox - it seems to have disappeared?  I assume you guys are working on the accounting issues necessary to book the swaps on the Garden State deal.  Regards Delainey 
 Richard, I think I am starting to obsess and I really don't want you guys working on this; however, it think that it is very odd that this Griffin guy over an eight week process, two registered letters and a phone conversation does not send a letter or bring up this "Chrome Dreams" issue from 1986 with us until this lawsuit is filed without our knowledge.  This guys sounds a little off.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI 
 Janet, we have been down the road with these guys before and it was not very pleasant.  I think it is hightly unlikely that Larry will be coming up with an additional 7FA turbine - but you can call him.  I'm also starting to think as the LM position starts to get better managed that maybe you and Chris should take the D5's and 7EA's onto your book.  Something to think about, I am just concerned about your ability to manage more complex deals without some resource availability.  I think you have to feel pretty good about the LM position first.  Something to think about?  Regards Delainey 
 How could coal fired QF's play into your and George's strategy?  Regards Delainey 
 George, it is probably worth  speaking to them about the US assets - probably the smaller Virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great brownfield sites. I'm not sure we would have an interest in UK coal fired assets. I would speak to Sherriff on that one. However, I would caution that real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents.  For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based on gas being on the margin.  Now that was before a lot of the run up so it may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys. As well, I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - I'm not sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a Wall Street point of view.  We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia assets. Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's point of view..  Dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger part of the load curve, coal assets or coal QF's may be great assets for us from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view. Have we looked at this?  Are there many in the market?  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, please call Jeff and go through in detail how we got to our valuation of approximately $39 M.  Please ensure that this is a reasonable facsimile of value that ENA would accreate over the short to medium term assuming your continued management.  Let me know where you end up.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, I don't believe the offer I showed you of $39 M is unreasonable. In fact the team had recommended $42 M based on a number of measures.  I see the 6X multiple of annualized Q2 earnings as one of the best measures of the potential value of this company.  I don't see it in the best interests of Enron to be transferring assets below a reasonable market value between business units.  You can trust that I will be keeping the Energy Capital Resources team's feet to the fire on the realization of this value if you do not purchase the company.  If you and Steve can come up with a better indication of value, I will support that transaction.  Regards Delainey 
 Rick, looks like a good start - as per our discussion, this is a very important issue.  Janet, please assist on the UI front if necessary.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, thanks for the update - I am assuming that you will come up with $23M Cdn ($16M USD) - "highly likely" with PML.  We do not have recorded in the financial statements the $8M Cdn in done deals - you may want to look into that.  We need the money to show up given every other Enron group is flaking - bail me out my friend!  Regards Delainey 
 Thanks - -  I'm looking at August 28.  Thanks,  Kay 
 I am now asking for  August 28, 2000.  Thanks,  Kay 
  Enron North America Corp. 
 Well, we have a slight problem.  Mark has just replied to my memo and he will not be in Houston on that date.  Could we make it for August 28, 2000 ?  Thanks,  Kay  3-0643    Enron North America Corp. 
 Dave and Mark have asked me to arrange a meeting, QBR HPL/LRC/Upstream Origination, and I would like to know if August 22, 2000 from 1:00 - 5:00 pm will work for all of you?  Thank you in advance for your promt attention to this matter.   Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Ray, if Mark does not have any other comments - lets go ahead and send the memo out ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 Please mark you calendar to reflect the following:   Date:  August 14,  2000 Monday  Time:  1:00 pm - 4:00 pm  Location: 3321  Topic:  Industrial QBR   I apologize for any any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.  Thanks  Kay 3-0643 
 Due to a conflict with Dave and Mark's calendars I need move the East Midstream QBR to Tuesday August 15, 2000.

 Guys, we need to figure this out in the next couple weeks.  John do you want to take a stab based on manager, director and VP rankings? Regards Delainey 
 Guys, any interest?  Regards Delainey 
 Lou, are there concerns that I am not aware?  From an economic point of view, it is clearly not in our interest to aggregate residential or small customers who have retail choice; however, standard office service (like the UI deal) is clearly a customized, wholesale/all -requirements sale of significant size negotiated with the utility and the puc.  Regards Delainey 
 On the fee, let Mike manage he knows my thoughts.  Regards Delainey 
 Ray, couple of comments: a) Donahue is responsible for the portfolio management function but also incorporate the idea of Jeff being responsible for ENA's "capital book" (ie) managing existing deals and intimately involved in conjunction with Treasury and the various origination groups of which finance transactions get or don't get on our books; b) Has Fastow clearly put Defner in the ENA Treasurer role? - if so we should also mention this in the note; c) Chuck Ward ( Generation Investments); Don Miller ( Merchant Generation); and d) with regard to commodity structuring ensure it is clear that they will facilitate and structure the highest priority/value transactions across the organization even though they report to Janet (ie) they don't just work on East Origination deals.  Let me see the final before release. Make sure Mark is on side.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, this looks great - looking forward to seeing your final thoughts.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, scheduling this is a nightmare - if Ben can't make it you can cover.  Thanks Dave 
 Thanks Mike - great job on the 2000's and the recovery at Doyle.  Lets together once the accounting is completed and determine what is appropriate in fee to pay.  Regards Delainey

 Jeff, have you finalized how Jenn and Craig will split out the industrial segments? They should also come up with their business plans and a reporting matrix similar to what you are doing with the desks.  How are you making out at the desk level in implementing our previous discussions with Scott and the remainder of the desks?  Regards Delainey

 Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.  The goal would be to have a definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could be acted upon.  a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.; b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.; c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.; d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel "header" - Jean M.; e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.; f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al - Patrick   W.  I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to determine a final action plan.  Regards Delainey 
 Max, congrats on the Decero PPA - we need to wrestle up another 100 to 200 MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your resources?  On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?  Regards Delainey

 Mary, I'm just curious why you need that info but it is 0 outside Enron comp plans.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, there is quite a number of us dealing with this problem - what are our solutions?  Could we have a corporate jet available for folks stuck in the A&A PRC? Other?  Regards Delainey 
 This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.  With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com on the command line of your browser.  The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.   Thanks,   Dave 
 Jim, I agree - lets put a plan in place to ensure appropriate representation at these ISO's (not unlike PAC) and ensure that FERC is not abdicating their responsibilities.  The three of us probably need to get together and discuss tactics around a number of issues.  Jim, I am also curious where you are in your thoughts and plans given your new role.  Regards Delainey 
 Folks, you are the remaining officers of ENA that have not yet enrolled in this mandated training program.  It is ENA's goal to have all its officers through the program before the end of calendar year 2000.  The course has received very high marks for effectiveness.  Please take time now to enroll in the program. Speak to your HR representative if you need help getting signed up.  Regards Delainey 
 Ed, sounds like you have this handled - I would like to use your report as the example to use in other groups.  It can wait until you have it all completed.  You may want to think about EOL as well (ie) how many companies have you brought on-line, etc.  summary: - coverage metrics; - market iniatives; - completed deals; - hot list; - EOL metrics.  Thxs Delainey 
 Guys, what is the contingency plan to manage these outages in the event we can't manage this as effectively in future situations?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, your teams did a great job managing a very difficult situation with very few material effects to the organization.  It is noticed and appreciated please pass on to your organization if you feel appropriate.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we managed the position in a very effective manner.  Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors on these boards?  Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti is putting plan in place.  Regards Delainey 
 Nella, sorry to see you go; however, best of luck in all your future endeavours.  Regards Delainey 
 Don, in my opinion options 1 & 2 are the same and 3 is not an option.  I would like to provide an outsourcing deal that earns us fees and provides information.  We will manage the internal issues.  A properly priced and scoped term outsourcing deal should be doable.  Please speak with Sally Beck and Beth Perleman.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as per our discussion, I am assuming that the upstream group will provide gross margin (not including trading) of $30.7M net of the HPL compressor writedown of $3.0M.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, thanks for the note -  I have you down for a firm incremental $3.875 M net to Enron.  Regards Delainey 
 Sorry about the confusion.  Fran Mayes will be sending a memo out in the next day or so reflecting the times of the PRC.  In order to accommodate Dave's meeting with all you and to include Mark Frevert we had to move the time of the PRC from 8:00 am to 11:00 am.  The ONLY thing changed was the time, the date and place remain the same.  Again, I am sorry for the confusion and I hope this helps.  If you have any question, please feel free to call me.   Thanks,  Kay 
 Greg, it is really up to you - if you have other things to do don't worry about it.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, we are getting close to completing the quarter, the following gross margin is expected from each of these groups before the end of the week.

 Ken, in response to your note, I am not aware of any official dialogue with Mr. Kase Lawal about a potential sale of Mariner or with the economics of the aborted IPO.  His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months ago.  However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention significant increases in gas and oil prices.  Our current valuations, in the $600M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve growth and current energy prices.  Our current goal, is to be able to demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a significant E&P concern that desires an offshore division.  The concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a very poor IPO candidate ((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable strategy to maximize the exit value).  I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points: a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.  Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to sell tha asset.  I hope this meets with your approval.  Regards Delainey

 Rob, makes sense. How does this change our view on Moore?  egards Delainey 
 Bob, I know that you made this work !!  This recovery plan is exceptional.  Regards Delainey 
 Rick, in the interest of preserving trees and keeping the information reasonably controlled, I would distribute this to senior managment and the portfolio managers in each origination group responsible for each investment.  Portfolio Managers  Steve Pruett - Energy Capital Resources - (E&P) Chuck Ward - Generation Investments Chris Helfrick - Industrials and Coal Michael Miller - Principal Investing Richard Lydecker - Restructuring Ray Bowen - CTG Andrea Reed - CTG Wes Colwell - Controller Jordan Mintz - Tax  Management  Jeff Skilling Joe Sutton Mark Frevert Dave Delainey   I don't think we need to distribute this data farther.  The business unit heads in the finance origination groups can access their portfolio manager for the data if needed.  Regards Delainey

 Wes, expense the amortization to Office of the Chairman not West Power or Origination.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, thanks for the assistance.  We have a few items still outstanding on the Doyle (Georgia PPA with Ogelthorpe) unit; however, It looks like we have the '99 and '00 plants completed.  The 2001 program is much smaller.  I will follow up shortly.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I will forward the info as it becomes available.  There appears to be one project in Texas and one in California which are well down the development road.  If interested in these projects, which have to meet a December 2001 COD in order to get the tax credit, I would suggest that we purchase the development sites and turbines from Enron Wind and keep the asset, commodity position, tax credit and possible green credits in ENA. They are Ok with that strategy.  This is an opportuntity that needs to fleshed out fairly quickly - Ben and Dave can you lead this analysis with close contact with Doug and Tim on the desk.  We can get together to discuss if you like.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11.0M) has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville and Ondarza).  As you are aware, I sued them for breach.  The settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.  It is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.  It seemed logical to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability.  Lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 rodney, are you managing and coordinating these reference requests for ENA to EES?  I think that these requests need to be highly controlled into the EES organization at a high level and screened by you as being necessary or not.  Regards Delainey 
 I believe this has been handled appropriately; however, FYI.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as a follow up to our meeting - the deliverables include:  a) producer team - Jones/Polzin - one live deal/prospect from the producer sector for the insurance product in third quarter; b) power team - Duran/Overdyke - one live deal/prospect from the IPP sector for the insurance product in the third quarter.  Thanks  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as a follow up to our mtg - the following deliverables were agreed to:  a) CMS/Noxtech deal structure - outsource product - McClellan/Affelt - next week; b) ERC strategy in California - McGowan- couple weeks; c) fundamental analysis completion on California, NE and MW - McGowan - ongoing; d) regulatory support for SO2 and NOX - George to speak to Genelle; Delainey speaks to Shapiro/Kean.

 Rob, can you give me a view on where you stand for fourth quarter from an orig point of view ie) deals and value.  Regards Delainey 
 please handle  regards delainey 
 Ray, I am ok with Nick and his group managing if Redmond/Mrha are ok.  Like Rebox, whoever is technically responsible is highly accountable to ensure that reporting and procedures are correctly followed and that the project comes in on time, budget and technically works.   In this capacity, I would like that engineer to report to you or Wayne Mays.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, what is your current thought process on TXU? Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I am getting the impression that we are having quality control issues - it just sounds sloppy?  Am I wrong?  Do we need more focused resources?  Regards Delainey 
 Gary, I have not heard much more on this issue - are you ok with this?  Regards Delainey 
 Where did he rank against other folks at the super saturday?  I would argue that if he was in the top 30%, we should accomodate his need.  regards delainey 
 Guys, the project should be charged market based rates and ENA is not in the business of subsidizing international projects.  This is particularily the case if we are not going to hold a continued interest in the project.  However, if we can not reach a term O&M agreement please maintain the optionality in the project by managing the facility on a direct bill basis to APACHI until they find an alternative provider. Do not in any event abandon any assets at any time.  Regards Delainey 
 I think Jean is gong to be there - thats ok.  Regards Delainey 
 Sorry Mike wrong address 
 Please follow up with this person if interested.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, I would like to discuss this with you and your plans in gas.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, in the east power group and the gas groups, we are trying to build a mid-market capability(deal flow, information and coverage) consistent with the largest energy merchant in N.A..  Please see tha attached.  I would be curious to talk to you about your structure, coverage functions and market building iniatives.  I recognize that you and your group have been the most effective and proactive group in these areas for some time.  Is there areas where we could be more aggressive or proactive?  Can I get you more resources to cover the market more aggresively?  Lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Ed, this looks great!!!!  Please ensure that the focus is on coverage, deal flow and building markets. I want to avoid two groups hunting strategic elephants (ie) east origination and development so ensure the scope is consistent with mid-market coverage and feeding the desk deals and info.   In the case of building or purchasing assets please let Jacoby's group handle.  Any deal or lead that significantly disrupts coverage or takes you or your people out of the market please pass or coordinate with origination or development  There is bound to be some conflict between the strategic origination groups and you - please keep to a minimum and resolve in a manner consistent with one team and doing the right thing.  Please provide John and I a monthly report of customer transactions completed, coverage plans and "market building iniatives".  Let me know how I can assist in any way in recruiting or transactions.  Regards Delainey 
 What about Barry and Eric? This looks good.  regards Delainey 
 Don, with regard to your previous message please contact Michael.  Regards Delainey 
 please approve in system 
 Ben, don't do anything at this point.  It is not needed.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I suggest that we write it down in order to ensure that we don't get it back as other groups use up the Raptor capacity. We have sufficient market data points to do this.  Please advise.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, lets get together to get final resolution to these issues including the peaker fee asap.  Regards Delainey

 Guys, we are working to put together the final team to manage this issue; however, it isJeff Skilling's call to keep Delainey, Milnthorp and Keohane out of the day to day fray on this issue.  I believe this is the right call. Commercial and legal resources from Houston will manage this issue on a go forward basis and may call on you as a resource if needed from time to time. You have done a very great job managing this issue to date and your efforts on that front are much appreciated.  Our focus should return to growing the business and meeting our financial targets.

 Mike, why would it cost $450 to $470/kw for the Moore project?  It is a 4 unit ABB configuration and the turbine costs appear to be in line with Wilton 7EA's on a kw basis. 
 Rob,this deal is not dead; I am primarly waiting on NEPCO numbers.  You should be moving down the road on the deconstruction, refurbishment and movement of the NB machines.   You should also be doing any development work (permits, interconnection agreements et al) you need to do to maintain the optionality of this project (let me know if the expenses get above $1MM).  Randy, please facilitate. Mike, can we put the screws to ABB given the significant transformer business we forwarded their way?  Laura, we probably need to make a call on the Peoples turbine pretty soon.  Eric/Rob, I think we need to see the project with IDC come in  between 350 to 400/kw to be viable or I need a very detailed analysis of why it costs significantly more than a Frame 7 machine in the US markets.  I would like see us make this work.  Regards Delainey 
 This is great - please update and forward weekly. Regards Delainey 
 Eric, I am on the road - I really don't have much to say. We have had very little interaction.  Regards Delainey 
 Good job - Randy.   Live to fight another day - I don't know if you know but I settled with Fort James - we ripped up all three contracts for no money that netted us approximately $15M in value through the elimination of the two power contracts in the NW.  Wertz was on the other side.  Thought you might want to know.  Thanks Delainey 
 Jeff, can you spend a little time thinking about the current North American energy markets (very high energy prices, stretched infrastructure, etc) and determine which game changing or altering technologies, business models or existing corporate positions that will benefit from such price and volatility levels.  In particular, I think that Miller should take a look at coal gasification technologies, emissions technologies and DSM/efficiency technologies and how these investments may fit in the charter or our overall business.  As well, from a corporate development point of view which parts of the value chain ie) IPP, E&P, utility, assets, etc are undervalued given current commodity curves and expectations.  Can you get back to me with a few ideas in the next week or so - maybe it would help to go pick a few brains in various ENA orgs as part of your process.  Regards Delainey 
 This is great Rob!  Regards Delainey 
 This is a reminder !!!!!  There will be a Friday Meeting, June 2, 2000.  Date:  Friday June 2, 2000  Time:  2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location: 30C1  Topic:   Combined Staff and Budget Meeting     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643) or Bev (3-7857).  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Rodney, please give Cliff a call.  I spoke with him today.  He will handle. Please fill him in on your discussions to date.  Thanks Delainey 
 Eric, we need more than $2M saving to get this deal to clear the hurdle.  I think we need to get to $350 to $400/kw firm including IDC to make this viable.  Please ensure that NEPCO is working to figure out the disconnect.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick , I appreciate the effort on the Moore project - I would hope that there is more than a $2m saving in the scope.  This plant is still showing $460 to $470/Kw given current economics.  I am still puzzled by this.  Regards Delainey 
 John, great job!  Please, work with Jeff to move the longer term deal along.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I will set up a monthly meeting between myself and you guys to discuss deal flow, priorities and strategy - I think you will find that more effective and I can keep the other meeting small.  Kay, please set up.  Regards Delainey 
 Ben,  why are we distributing this?  It is inaccurate and I'm not sure I want it floating around the place.  Regards Delainey 
 Celeste, try and get him scheduled into the Super Saturday if possible so that the risk guys can take a look at him.  If that can't be done then give me a call.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, I think we should renew the flame for the three year period.  My understanding is that it is $75 K Cdn per year roughly.  Not paid up-front and cancellable if Flames leave Calgary or disappear.  Expense in Canada.  It is your call ultimately.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave, I am going to send Shawn your way - he has extensive development, asset and project finance experience.  I would like him under your supervision to manage our coal power development strategy - like we discussed it could be a very robust strategy with multiple exit points.  I strongly believe that coal needs to come back into the stack and that the existing development teams (Parquet & Jacoby) are already buried under mid-stream gas development opportunities.  This would incorporate acquisitions, development, technology,  asset sales, emissions credits & technology, fuel supply and power sales.  Please update your 2001 budget to incorporate this new iniative.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I though we signed a turnkey with NEPCO - there should not be any overruns to your P&L if that is the case.  Regards Delainey 
 I think it would be great if Dan and Kevin could participate.  Regards Delainey 
 During our off-site at Columbia Lakes recently,  we identified areas in ENA where significant gaps exist that need filling at the Analyst and Associate level.  We have scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday on June 3, 2000 and I would like your participation as an interviewer.  We will need approximately 25-30 interviewers to fill approximately 30 Associate & Analyst positions.  I am counting on everyone making themselves available on the third to facilitate this priority action item.  Ted Bland will be forwarding information concerning the event to each of you early next week.  Thank you for your participation.  Dave

 Guys, Wes is going to come talk to you about booking more value in Mariner in order to meet Global Finance and ENA targets.  I want a view from you guys of what is the prudent carry value for Mariner assuming current gas prices and the reserve increases assumed to coming.  Keep in mind what would be a reasonble sale value for the asset mid-next year as per our plan.  Regards Delainey

 Kevin, I would like more detail on these issues of which I was not aware - lets discuss next week.  Regards Delainey 
 Any ideas?  These guys (John & Jere) just can't get it together.  Regards Delainey 
 Jere, I understand your frustruation and I am very motived to prove out the insurance product; however, I do think John has a legitimate concern (especially given the fact that this group blew up very publically internally and externally and we need to repair the image internally and market perception externally in order to be successful in the future) surrounding multiple groups covering the same customers with different stories.  You guys could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John at the offsite): a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination if this is a commercially viable product; b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote this capability to these customers ASAP; c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP; d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.  This appears to be a reasonable and logical approach on an interim basis.  Regards Delainey 
 Tom, you are making the right call - give me a day or two to manage the positions.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, Swank has confirmed with me that he is committed to join the mid-market group in east power and make a difference.  I would strongly support his movement into either SERC or ECAR as per our earlier discussion.  I hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in those markets.  I would also hope to move a reasonable number of new associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various desks.  The goal is  to increase the bench strength of the trading and mid-market groups plus support John's iniatives on the fundamental groups.  Regards Delainey 
 This will confirm our dinner meeting to be held May 23, 2000 at the River Oaks Grill  DATE    MAY 23, 2000 PLACE   WINE ROOM RIVER OAKS GRILL 2630 WESTHEIMER (713) 520-1738 TIME    6:30 PM   If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Kay (30643) or Beverly (57857)  I will look forward to seeing you there. 
 Bill, can you set up a meeting to discuss credit issues. just you and I is fine.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, try and schedule me in 
 FYI 
 fyi 
 Larry and Joe,  Is there any additional moral pressure that we can put on Westinghouse to get the resources needed to expedite the resolution of the Gleason 501FD issues and the vibration issues at Wheatland?  The phone call by Larry to GE has made a world of difference.  Regards Delainey 
 I am in Florida - I think I am available the night of the 24th for the baseball game.  Kay please follow up - I would like to make the game.  regards Delainey 
 Rob, Andy Fastow is the only one who has not signed the DASH.  He may have a few questions please give him a call.  Otherwise, Kay Chapman and/or Mark Frank have the DASH.  I have signed.  Regards Delainey 
 Tammy, please ensure that budgets and cost tracking similar to the peakers/Doyle are set up ASAP for Austin and Vitro.  These should be updated and circulated weely.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI 
 Jere, I spoke with Scott on these targets and his belief is that both himself, Allen and John have significant relationships with these folks which should help leverage your product into this sector. Scott and John have agreed to set up these meetings with the decision makers in these targets with no delay.  From there, you, John and Scott can determine what deal team will go speak to them about the opportunities.  I would expect that we will be in front of these folks ASAP.  Lets see how the product is embraced by these customers before we extend the target list and create a more formal alignment of the groups.  As per your earlier e-mail, I assume you are working on the Reeding & Bates opportunity.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, I forwarded your interest to Whalley, McConnel and McMahon.  Any=20 technology effort really should be lead by NetWorks.  This is consistent wi= th=20 Skillings strategy and what has been communicated to the analysts.  You=20 should receive a call from one of these gentlemen.  Regards Delainey 
 This looks good Mike - I appreciate the efforts.  Regard Delainey 
 Looks rather impressive.  Good job.  Regards Delainey 
 Jere, please forward the list of targets. Let me speak initially with John - lets try and get this done today.  I appreciate the effort on the peakers. As well, I would suggest we start discussions with  Reeding & Bates which according to both Redmond and Thompson is a live deal.  Thanks Delainey 
 Ken, in response to the letter from Mr Miguel San Juan, my suggestion would be to offer up the Falcon for their use; however, given the tight time frame and your recent visit with Mr. Fox that it would be difficult for either you or me to participate.  I spoke to Max and he agrees with this approach.  I hope this meets with your approval.  Regards Delainey 
 Thxs Joe -much appreciated. Dave 
 Rob, does the new contract have the same price or is it an increase?   If it is at the same price, I would agree with Barry that this is a very visable display of Enron Canada's participation in the business and social community and it should continue to sponsor the flame.  On the accounting front, expense it in Canada - it will be an explainable variance for this year and budgeted next.  Let discuss  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I appreciate the updates. Please ensure 1) that you, as ENA, are integrated 2) deliver a very clear expectation with EE&CC with a credible plan and 3) that you scream bloody murder if a deliverable is missed.  You will need to bird-dog this to closure on an hourly basis to ensure that we get over the goal line.  Keep me in the loop daily so that I can keep the pressure on at a senior level.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, have we started the mobilization on the tear-down of the two 501FD's at Gleason?  Will they be machining the equipment on site - it appears to me that we should not let that equipment leave the site if possible.  Do we have a credible site rep from Westinghouse for both Wheatland and Gleason?  Please advise.  Thanks Delainey 
 Joe, I would appreciate a quick call by you to Larry to ensure that his organization is focused to get these plants over the goal line ASAP.  We still have technical issues with the vendor that need to be addressed.  I believe EE&CC is working the issues; however, a phone call from you to emphasize the importance to Enron will add extra encouragement.  Thanks.  Regards Delainey 
 Lew, it looks like I have some appointments I can't get out of on the 24th; however, we could be out there by noon on the 25th.  How does that fit?  I did get a call from Mike letting me know that he would be sending over the CA.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I understand that none of the facilities were available today - I thought we were targeting 750 MW.  What is the updated availability schedule for each unit?  We are only a couple of weeks from June 1.  Please advise.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike Moulton has been pursuing an idea in the technology area for a while. = =20 The sponsorship of this idea clearly fits in Net Works.  Could one of you= =20 fine gentlemen give his idea a test drive?  I would much appreciate if you= =20 could give him a call.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, you need to make your own call on that one - I think you could add value in either.  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, FYI - In my estimation this business is no bigger than Mexico or the Toronto business ie) $25 to $30M in real value with reasonably high risk.  I see no value in having two different agendas being pushed in S. America.  I also believe that we could cut overhead and right size the organization and not loose any capability.  Early estimations are a reduction in budgeted OH by at least a third to one-half.  Did you or Jeff speak with Jim?  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, when did BP Amoco get involved?  I thought we were dealing with Avista.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, what is our emissions strategy for these counterparties?  Regards Delainey 
 both 
 Maybe that commercial is closer than to the truth than I thought ...... Regards Delainey 
 Sounds good - I think you have a great opportunity in this market - I would suggest staffing aggressively in order to take the first mover advantage.  I note the associate needs.  Regards Delainey 
 Sounds good - lets see if we can start marketing the product and the capability.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, I will want to see those economics.  Thanks Delainey 
 David, once you get the demand lets discuss before deployment.  Regards Delainey 
 That may work -  I don't want to end up with an equity position I just worked hard to eliminate. Further, raptor may be a good accounting hedge but if we took back JEDI's share at existing marks we would be destroying significant real value. Will the buy back price of the equity/debt we get back from JEDI incorporate the write downs we think should occur?  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, my understanding is that there continues to be some discussion on whether there will be functional seperation of the retail and wholesale businesses and to what extent and under what strategy these are undertaken. I am not sure that we want to put ourselves in a box under any structure until these things are completely ironed out eg) country managers et al.  I'm not in agreement with any memo that further details the organization beyond what was outlined in the original memo.  However, I am in agreement that this needs to get resolved ASAP unfortunately Frevert and Skilling and most of the first world is out this week.  I ask for your patience.  Lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Gere, just following up on the offsite - have you all agreed on the target producer list for the insurance product?  How is the peaker product developing?  Regards Delainey 
 How do we immunize ourselves from the workouts being shed into Raptor?  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, who is working on the Duke restructuring now?  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, I can't open - please send hard copy.  Regards Delainey 
 Shelly, I would like for David and I to handle this process from the Office of the Chair in order to ensure an orderly deployment of needed resources. Please facilitate through Mr. Oxley.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI 
 just send it out to the affected parties.  thxs dave 
 all yours 
 Just practicing apathy.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, sorry for the delay - lets talk if you think it is warranted.  I can see a lot of positives to take this path. However,  there are a) pr issues and b) we have hoards of on-going litigation that cost us a bundle.  We should make this decision very carefully.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, I forwarded a message to you from Sheri Sierra from a gentleman looking for energy mgt services in Japan.  I had asked you to forward to Joe Hirl.  Please follow up with Joe.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please ensure I get to this.  Thxs Dave 
 ?????? 
 Vicki, how much $$ are we talking about for the bankruptcy and the class action suit? It does not seem inappropriate for us to share the bankruptcy costs given the CTC issue.  I agree with you on the class action suit.  Lets discuss further before we approach ENA.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, are we in London during this event? Regards Delainey 
 Peggy, the last version I read was fine.  Regards Delainey 
 Sherri, I will be there.  Regards Delainey 
 Thanks Chris - I assume you are speaking about credit risk on the thirty day deal when you refer to the $2M exposure on $100 - has Tim spoken to John about this?  I am supportive of this proposal and approach.  Like our discussion, we have to find a way to be supportive to the re-development of this market without creating un-acceptable credit or market losses.  We also have to support Lay's efforts in California.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, fyi  Regards Dave 
 Brett, got it covered.  thanks Dave 
 Steve, what is the status?  Regards Delainey 
 John, I spoke to Milly - he is on side.  I have completed all reviews except Kishkill and Orlando - how do you want to handle this?  Regards Delainey 
 thanks Peter - and congrats on the promotion well deserved.  Keep actively managing constructively your constituency in Houston.  Regards Delainey 
 thxs ben - i'm sure our paths will cross again.  best of luck.  regards delainey 
 thanks Rick  By the way, JCP is being restructured or killed.  Regards Delainey 
 David, I'm not sure there is any value to this for EES North America. There are well known and documented controls and process issues in the mid, back and risk offices of the company.  We are working quickly to rectify  - servicing your needs at the same time would slow us down.  On the European side, I would like your perspective on their controls and business.  Regards Delainehy 
 Joe, I will forward his voice mail to you.  EES has enough challenges in NA and Europe before tackling retail products and services in a market with no wholesale market.  Please follow up.  Thanks Delainey 
 no 
 Shawn, just a little buried - why don't you come by on Monday. Kay please schedule.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, I would get Mark or Louise involved at this point - if it is mission critical let me know.  Regards Delainey 
 Matthew, sounds fine - I will have Kay start managing the calendar.  Regards Delainey 
 Matthew, if you know my reputation, I tend not to be a big fan of these type of events either - however, at this point, I need to collect more information on the event and I think it inappropriate to cancel at this late stage. Going forward, I think we as a management team including yourself should discuss what the strategy should be going forward.  Don't hesitate to voice your opinion.  Regards Delainey 
 Hey Crystal hope things are well ....  Dawna is fine. We have two girls six (Kassandra) and four (Samantha).  We have been in Houston now three and half years.  It has been a good move from a career point of view.  Obviously, you had heard my move from Pres./CEO of Enron North America to Chair/CEO of EES.  I hope life has been as kind to you.  Best of luck in the future.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, please let Brian know if there is a problem and let him rectify.  It is difficult for me to be responsive otherwise.  Thanks Dave 
 Matthew, Janet and I are going to come your way before March 12th.  I'll give you a call to discuss further.  Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday:  - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron and EES; - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 2001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 2001; - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for the large industrial customer); - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that effort; - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals; - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - no bullshit politics; - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership; - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success; - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February early March.  PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.  Talk to you soon!!  Regards Delainey 
 I'm sorry Bob - AMPS 
 Bob, please give me an update on our progress on this item and the viability of the technology.  Regards Delainey 
 Richard, it is my understanding that this investment is currently in Ray Bowen's business.  In my ENA shoes, I would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility.  In my EES shoes, I would like to take a closer look at the possible connections.  Please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio.  I have also heard that Tom White has been talking to you about EES taking on the Catalytica investment.  With my EES shoes on, no way!!!!  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, I appreciate your note and I am sure that you will work well with Chris.  I have always believed in your talents and capabilities - I won't be far ....  Regards Delainey 
 Ed, thanks for the note - hope things are going well.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, I apologize that no one talked to you before this one went out.  I assumed that Marty or Dan had spoken to you as we discussed this initial change; however, I take full responsibility.  I will guarantee it won't happen again.  My understanding is that you have been a significant contributor to EES strategy and success.  You can count on a lot more discussion about which markets and products are core in the few weeks and you will be leading a market opportunity.  I have asked Kay to set up some time for us to discuss the market and the future next week.  If that is not soon enough, I am around all day today.  Regards Delainey 
 thsx for the note Dick - look forward to working with you.  regards Delainey

 Thanks Dave  Regards Delainey

 Rick, I need your view on which of these deals need to go through the board:  - Tex Mex (ERCOT to Mexico transmission line with term PPA with Desarco) - Ahlstrom (QF Purchase) - CRRA/Fuel Cell Energy (fuel cell deal with Conn. regulators) - sale of Pastoria and LV Cogen (assume not) - sale of ECP (assume not) - sale of HPL (assume not).  Regards Delainey 
 Matthew, would your Monday meeting be a good time (if the time change works) for me to introduce myself and say a few words via video conference or the like to your organization?  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, I need your re-submission of the plan document including goals and objective asap so that we can have a final discussion and finalize.  We should also set up some time to finalize your review.  Regards Delainey 
 Laura, I know you are busy but I need your plan submission asap so that we can discuss and finalize.  Regards Delainey 
 a) year end reviews - report needs generating like mid-year documenting business unit performance on review completion - David to John; b) work out or plan generation for the NIM/Issues employees - David to John; c) HPL transition issues - ongoing.  Officially transferred.  Regards Delainey 
 Jaime, appreciate all your efforts and I am sure you will find a way to hit your targets this year.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, Brian Redmond  Dave 
 FYI 
 Joe, has Jeff Rubin confirmed his availability on December 14th from 4:00 to 5:30PM to give us a macro-economic overview ?  Regards Delainey 
 John, I asked Brian to investigate taking a number of ESA's engineering folks into his central Technical Services group.  These folks would continue to work on ESA's projects but would get the resources and support of the centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors including NEPCO and OEC.  It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development risk.  Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, I only have the following suggestion for the Office of the Chairman paragraph:  "Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave, in the Office of the Chairman, will be Marty Sunde, as President, Global Marketing Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services.  Dan and Marty have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES business model.  In addition, Janet Dietrich will join the Office of the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Currently, Janet is Managing Director in Enron Americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination organizations."  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, write these down in pencil - I need a chance to review.  thanks Dave 
 FYI, refer to previous note. 
 FYI, Ken we may want you to speak to Peevey and Freeman.  I believe that discussion should frame the proposal and attempt to set up a meeting with his staff and advisors to answer questions about credit and documentation.  In the propsal, we have tried to frame the potential credit and legal holes in their RFP with our suggested language or documents.  It would be helpful for the commercial team in ENA/EES to meet with these gentlemen and their advisors to describe the proposal and perhaps move towards negotiating a transaction.  The proposal includes: a) traded power products of various sizes and terms; b) unit contigent tolls from Pastoria (750MW) and Las Vegas Cogen (222MW) for term; c) natural gas packages for size for one through five year terms to provide gas hedges for their QF portfolio or other contracted merchant toll contracts; and d) an preliminary proposal on DSM from EES.  I will forward an executive summary from Chris Calger with more detail.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, should we put more meat on this bone?  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, the CALME organization does not exist so it might be difficult to negotiate a transfer price - we need to just do the right thing for Enron - if you think you are getting stuffed economically then I would work a deal out with Lavo or Whalley.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as a follow on to our discussion last week:  a) run the RFP for VN service for Electro - variety of terms, volumes  as per our discussion - next thirty days - Orlando; b) explore the possibility of adding four additional LM's to the Electrobolt structure as a form of generation mitigation for the Electro short - would Petrobras be open to this discussion and what would be the last date that we would have to call NTP to get in on time to make 2003 - Joe; c) as much information on the nature of the Electro short and any customer contractual positions that can be provided to Lavo to start estimating the value  of the possible straddle - Orlando d) re-run the Cuiba MTM model given changing cost parameters, fuel issues and timing to determine what the possible hit may be and what are the mitigants - Joe; e) re-run budget numbers with correct view on re-organization costs - Joe; f) view on financial budget and strategic goals for 2001 and feedback to ESA - Lavo/Delainey; g) update commercial org chart reflecting discussions about the origination teams - Joe; and h) clarification on sale and asset responsibility in SA on a go forward basis given changing opinions on effectiveness of current organization - Lavo.  Outsourcing contacts: a) PetroCanada/Suncor - Eric LeDain b) Peoples Gas  - Laura Luce c) Virginia Natural Gas - Ed McMichael d) Brooklyn Union - Ed McMichael  Regards Delainey 
 fyi, action 
 working it 
 Ken, I will drive by - I am interested in looking at a few options.  thanks Dave 
 Wes, do you have the first cut?  John you need to have some input.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave Delainey has asked to have the following meeting arranged:   Date:  Friday February 2, 2001  Time:  10:30 am - 11:30 am  Location: EB 3321  Topic:  California Update   Please let me know if you have any questions or conflicts.  Thanks,  Kay   3-0643 
 Guys, do we have enough VAR to bring this position into the book?  If over $5M in total exposure it has to go to Frevert/Whalley.  John, I assume that you have gone through the transaction and have approved.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, sounds like we are moving backwards - but these guys tend to jump the gun at times.  If it is not possible for these orgs to work together lets not try and force them (ie) we will manage our own business and contract with NEPCO when and if it makes sense.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave has asked that a Staff Meeting be scheduled for Wednesday February 7, 2001, from 3:00 pm til 5:00 pm in 30C1.  Please mark your calendar and plan to attend.  If you have any questions and/or conflicts, please feel free to call me (Kay 3-0643).    Thanks,  Kay 
 Janet, if you are ok, I'm ok - we usually only sign these type of non-solicitations, stand-stills or non-competes if we are well down the road towards having a reasonable probability to completing a transaction with the counterparty.  Otherwise, it becomes a nightmare to manage all these.  I will leave it to your discretion.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, I assume that you are doing Lydecker, Maffitt and Detmering's review.  thanks Dave 
 Guys, can you start working on your presentations for the offsite.  Dave I would like you to focus on the new generation of capital products that you are working on for the IPP market which should be able to source short and medium term commodity liquidity and be syndicatable(?) on the capital side.  Go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities. It may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of coal generation (including emissions control) given current power and gas markets and a quick view of the development process. How should we participate in this market?  Gasification technology?  Jeff, in your talk, can you focus on the emerging distributed generation sector ie) the technologies, the users, the VC's, etc.  Specifically, how will these technologies change our business model and the overall power business model?  How are we positioning ourselves in this market?  What is the PI strategy with this regard?  Dorie Hitchcock and Tammy Sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, we need a first cut by December 8th.  Thanks Delainey 
 These are the reviews that I have completed or nearing completion: - Dave Duran - Joe Deffner - Tammy Sheppherd - Scott Josey - Brian Redmond - Rob Milnthorp - Janet Dietrich - Chris Calger - John Thompson - Max Yzaguirre - Jeff Donahue - Wes Colwell - Kay Chapman  David, Greg told me that you were going to create a master list of reviews/reviewers to be completed to ensure that the Wholesale OOC's catches all commercial and non-commercial direct reports.  I would suggest that we follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all reviews are completed across ENA much like the process we undertook at mid-year.  I would shoot for 100% participation target.  How are we making out on the NIM/Issues folks in ENA - either out the door or completed plans?  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, I assume that you are doing the review for Bob Virgo, Wayne Mays, Jean Mrha and Julie Gomez.  Regards Delainey 
 John, I assume that you are doing the review for Vince Kaminski.  Thanks Dave 
 Jeff, I assume that you are providing a review for Mike L Miller.  Thanks Dave 
 Guys, I do not have any material that Brian, Tim or Wes would not  have in their files.  Regards Delainey 
 ok, your call - do we have some spares available if needed?  regards Delainey 
 Kevin, the only thing to keep in mind are the patent issues on the DLN - the GE settlement prevents PSM from re-manufacturing any further "tainted" product including spares for the existing DLN system - how might this affect our reliability at peak times?  Regards Delainey 
 John, what do you want to do with this?  We had discussed but I wanted to follow up.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I'm a lowly piker but I will try to help.  Regards Delainey 
 Beth, can you start putting together your presentation for the offsite.  You have approximately one hour.  Topic should focus on the 2001 ENA systems plan (ie) what are identified priorities, key maintenance, new iniatives and maybe your view of where we need to go in the future.  I would leave some time for questions.  The audience should come away from the meeting with a pretty good understanding of what is our systems agenda for ENA in 2001.  Could you have a first cut by December 8th?  Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock can do some of the heavy lifting.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, where do we stand with Tom and the replacement combustion systems?  Regards Delainey 
 Yours! 
 Guys, I'm not the sharing type  - book me in the Forest Room.  Regards Delainey 
 Greg, nothing that pressing - I was just wondering how things were going and wanted to catch up on few things.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you work with Milly on this issue.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, can you discuss with the other groups to appropriately sort out the corporate opportunity (ie) Laura, Hunter, etc.  Thxz Dave 
 Kyle, sounds like a good deal - look forward to this play bearing fruit.  Thanks Dave 
 Kay, please ensure that her expense statements are signed by me.  Regards Delainey 
 yes 
 Hey, Rob try and keep under $100K US.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, if you and Dave think this is your best branding opportunity in the short run as we gear up I am supportive.  I assume this will be covered in Canada's budget.  Send me a towel.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay please send regrets - I think I am in Canada.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their transactions in Michigan et al.  Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to Houston? How are the structured deals managed?  Is this still the right split for the business?  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, you should be there if possible.  Regards Delainey 
 Can we realistically net transmission costs against CTC undercollections for EES?  If there is a credible argument we should discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave, we need to get this moving before the coal group starts occupying the space.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I am in complete agreement on the strategy.  This has been discussed for some time, Dave Duran and his group have distinct goals to move this strategy forward in 2001.  Regards Delainey 
 Scud incoming.... 
 Mike, as a policy offsites and retreats, especially more exotic and expensive, are being discouraged.  I would prefer the Galveston offsite and I don't see a need for more than one per year.  Please manage through PR - Dorie Hitchcock - she will  require an agenda as part of the approval process.  I would encourage some significant work discussion to be part of the offsite.  If you have some concerns lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, can you give me the particulars on the four MEH turbines (ie) scheduled delivery, price, fuel options, heat rate, output,etc - including transferablility to NA.  Regards Delainey 
 Milly is ok; however, I would like a quick read of the document once you send a hard copy up...  Regards Delainey 
 Jean, the $6M was a negotiated settlement between me and Marty Rosenberg of several old disputes as we moved forward in the restructuring of the Independence plant earlier in the year - Ruth added little other than administrative support.  Regards Delainey 
 George, it was good to hear from you - please follow up with David Oxley to determine possible roles within ENA.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, given all the change and our 2000 success, I would argue that we should have a meeting; however, the challenge is getting people to show up - any thoughts on this Eric/Dorie?  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, good memo - I think you mean't Energy Capital Resources not Enron Capital Resources in your memo.  I would distribute widely in the management ranks.  Regards Delainey 
 get rid of this please 
 Dave Delainey has asked me to arrange an offsite for January 16 & 17, at the St Regis Hotel, 1919 Briar Oaks Lane, Houston, Texas  77027.  If you have any questions/conflicts, please feel free to call me (Kay) @ 3-0643, otherwise, please mark your calendar and plan to attend:    Date:  Tuesday   January 16, 2001 Wednesday  January 17, 2001  Time:  10:00 am until  5:00 pm (Tuesday and Wednesday)  Location: The St. Regis Hotel 1919 Briar Oaks Lane Houston, Texas  77027 Phone:  713-840-7600 Fax:       713-840-7617   Thanks,  Kay 
 Guys, in coordination with your trading partners, can you start putting together your offsite presentations.  Each group will have approximately one hour to one hour and half.  A suggested format would include (for East Power, East Gas, West Power, Canada (power and gas), Central Gas and West Gas): a) market overview - including supply/demand, structural changes, etc; b) strategy and opportunities in 2001(include five new trading/origination opportunities for 2001); c) expected 2001 new products/structures, coverage and deal flow; d) what worked in 2000 what didn't; and e) organization and resources - people, assets, constraints, etc.  In a nutshell, we want you to share with the group how your market works, where the opportunties lie and how are you positioning yourself to take advantage of those opportunties in order to reach your financial and other goals in 2001.  Tammy Sheppard and Dorie Hitchcock will coordinate and do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, they need your first cut by December 8th.  Thanks  Delainey 
 Would this guy be a candidate for the LTP?  Regards Delainey 
 What is this?  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame or "cover our backsides";  however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the desk.  As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.  As executives of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly. Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into the overall framework of ENA.  I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading floor.  I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gas business.  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, please give me your thoughts via e -mail asap. I believe this will be the most effective tool.  Please give me your expectations as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Go go go....!!  Show us how the retail/wholesale business should work together. Great job!  Regards Delainey 
 Marty, looks like this nut may have some fruit. I look forward to continuing our discussions from 2000 on how we can be better together - I am committed to doing this the right way as I know you are.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, what is your view?  Regards Delainey 
 Randy, give them what they want and lets move on - don't give another guarantee provide the indemnity for the IRS and environmental claims.  Mark if there is a flaw in my thinking let me know.  Joe, these guys have been exceedingly difficult to deal with - I would think twice before we bring these guys into any Enron deal in the future.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, send to John Sherriff in Europe.  Regards Delainey 
 None - except for Enron comp (options et al). 
 Christy, can we send these documents in word format - I'm not sure if this is a problem for everyone but I can never open these attachments from Braeswell.  Can you please send a hard copy.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, don't trip me up until after January 15. 
 Mark, do we really want a story on SA at this point? Seems we have better things to talk about at this point in time.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, are we closed out on this job with NEPCO as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, work with Dorie Hitchcock and get an estimate/approval memo put together.  Regards Delainey 
 I have certainly missed your one liners - I will give you a call first thing tommorrow.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, go ahead and have the meeting - I think I know what it is about.  Let me know what you guys want to do.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, I noticed that Laura Scott is not on the list for non-commercial VP candidate but Georgiana and Sherman were - did you change your mind?  I think you have until the 4th to put up your candidates.  Regards Delainey 
 yes - we should arrange to get together on Sunday to discuss bonus, comp, promotions and rankings before the PRC on Monday.  I am back Saturday night. I hope this works let me know a time.    Regards Delainey 
 Wes, that is fine - flush it.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, in addition please incorporate in each teams package - their Direct Expense/Headcount ratio to plan average, Productivity ratio to plan average and team ROCE to plan average and any variances from 2000 to 2001 for income/expenses taking into account our most latest 2000 forecasts by group.  Wes, I assume that you will be putting together a final 2000 i/s package for me in the next couple of days.  Thanks Delainey 
 Rob, we are planning to file the following protest of HQ's behaviour in the NE power markets through their market based rates case with the FERC, do you have any issues with this approach?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a completed 2001 Pro Forma budget needing Lavo's review and then detailed review with each team.  This workbook has a number of worksheets including: a) pkrs o&m - this details the o&m costs for the sold peakers assuming we own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC; b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay expenses - not all that relevant if you assume that increasing drift will be offset by larger monetizations; c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external capital charges are added back to reach EBIT; d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget; e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups and bonus/other comp; f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001 assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond; g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed, assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then calculates a net capital and depreciation charge; h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are charged @ a blended rate of 9%.  Two action items: a) Print out for John - Commercial Income  & Summary worksheets for his comment and review & b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet (including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation), leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.  I would like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.    Regards Delainey 
 Janet, between you, Laura and Frank/Gil you should  be able to field a one Enron team on this one.  I am at your disposal otherwise.  Laura/Frank - this is an important one for the team - please work together constructively.  Gil should continue in his current role as main relationship manager unless you guys change your mind.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, great job on this one.....  2001 - should be a big year for Mexico: a) equity sell down of the Monterrey project; b) close and further sell down of the Tex Mex project; and c) 20% growth on risk mgt volumes and income from 2000 levels.   Thanks for the great work.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, thanks for the update - ensure that Azurix is eliminated from the project which can help financially support the Calpine water discount.  Do not hesitate to contact Amanda Martin or Garrisson directly on this one if needed.  What is the status of LV?  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I believe a current board member is likely to be picked - last I heard the mayor of Tupelo.  Craven will be in office until May.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, for US applications dual fuel may be important for Florida - maybe less in California.  Do we need it for Rio Gen or Cuiba?  Can you follow up with Chris Calger and Janet Dietrich to get their views.  Thanks Delainey 
 Lisa, I currently work in ENA as CEO and President - mostly nat gas and electricity.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca, sorry for the delay - I think that Chris Calger who runs our Western development efforts would be very interested.  Chris please give Rebecca a call.   Regards Delainey 
 Eric, as per our discussion, I would suggest that we have no quotes or comments in the press release.  As a sale of assets, which we do actively, in a our network strategy there is really nothing positive that can be said without reflecting poorly on the buyer.  I would suggest that we approve an AEP press release as we did with Allegheny.  If we have not already, I would not send the attached press release to AEP without cutting out the quote.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave will be out of the office December 23, 2000 until Monday, January 8, 2001.  He will be checking his voicemail and will have his cell phone.  The following are the numbers where he can be reached:   December 24  thru December 26 - Saskatoon, SK   (306) 374-9587 or Cell Phone   (713) 907-6315  December 27 thru January 7 - Fairmont, B.C.  (250) 345-4569 or Cell Phone (713) 907-6315    Beverly (x 5-7857) will be available to assist you if you need any help reaching Dave....   Happy Holidays, 
 rick, have a good holiday - John and I appreciate the support you and your group have provided.  regards Delainey 
 Bill, I think you are confusing me with John Lavorato my COO.  I am a University of Saskatchewan grad.  Regardless, if I can help lets discuss in the new year.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you put together the folllowing Portfolio/Charter Review for Principal Investing and Energy Capital Resources: a) detail existing portfolio - winners/losers; additions/deletions and overall performance; b) detail market conditions in your markets and any strategy changes following; c) anticipated major transactions in 2001; and d) review charter and detail any proposed changes.  I would anticipate that we sit down with Rick and Jeff at the end of January - please have package available for my review by mid January.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, it will have to wait - I will be back in early January.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave would like to schedule a meeting the you today to discuss HPL...... Would 4:00 pm be ok with all of you....???  please let me know your availability as soon as possible.  Thanks,  Kay 
 FYI 
 This looks good... all your cc are good and he said to send to all ENA=20 Employees.......  Thanks again for all your help......This will be out tomorrow morning,=20 correct ?????  Thanks,  Kay 
 Brett, since Enron owns NEPCO - true risk transfer under a fixed price contract is difficult.  However, I do like the behaviour that you get from such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget. My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like #1).  I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests appropriately.  You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.  I have already given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end of the scale and early.  Drop me a note on where you end up.  Regards Delainey 
 whats up?  Dave 
 thanks Susan  Regards Delainey 
 John, I need your 2000 accomplishment and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday.  Thanks Dave 
 Barry need your 2000 accomplishment and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday  Thanks Dave 
 Janet, need 2000 accomplishments and Enron resume/deal anthology for Ben Jacoby and Ed McMichael before Friday - please follow up.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, need your 2000 acoomplishments before Friday.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, I need your 2000 accomplishments and Enron resume/deal anthology before Friday.  Thxs Dave 
 Attached please find the final presentation for the board meeting tommorrow. I assume that RAC will have the resolutions and DASH.  Regards Delainey 
 This should be sent from John and me - Enron Americas, Office of the Chairman to all commercial and support employees in Enron North America.  In addition, copy to Joe Kishkill, Orlando Gonzales, Brett Wiggs and Remi Collognes in Enron South America.  As well, include Jeff Shankman, Mike McConnell, Jeff McMahon, Ray Bowen, Louise Kitchen, Phillipe Bibi, Rebecca McDonald, Jim Hughes, Mark Frevert, Greg Whalley.  Please ensure that I am able to proof the final copy before distributing.  I would like to have this by Wednesday night in everyone's e-mail Thursday morning.  Regards Dave 
 Rebecca, lets just go forward with HPL on Thursday - Tex Mex, after going through with the deal team, still has some issues to be resolved.  We will push this into Q1.  The HPL deal is anticipated to be signed on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca. attached you will find the presentation for the HPL deal.  Please forward to Jeff.  If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to give me a call.  Regards Delainey 
 yes thxs dave 
 Chris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call regardless of the hit.  Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be worthwhile.  Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you are doing the right thing.  Regards Delainey 
 Randy, looks like a good solution - well done.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, the outside date on termination due to force majeure was moved to October 31,2002.  It is our risk to construct the pipeline;however, it is a breach of contract if Petrobras does not have gas at the site by April 30, 2002.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a draft org memo that I anticpate going out on Thursday.  I appreciate your patience.  Please give me any comments ASAP (only major issues).  Brian/Tim, I assume that we need a communication strategy to HPL employees before this memo goes out - please advise.  Please keep this note confidential until release.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, this looks fine.  Regards Delainey 
 As I had indicated before please work through me or Brett - otherwise we risk our ability to move them - please forward appropriately.  Regards Delainey 
 Brett, under the assumption that we are not over-paying for the land and that the site has option value beyond the Petrobras deal, I am ok with the purchase.  Regards Delainey 
 Patrick, there are two pages missing (ie) Earnings & ROCE.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I assume you are keeping an eye on "California East".  Any help you can give Kevin would be much appreciated.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, can you set up some time - perhaps in the new year for a lunch - my office should be fine.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Janet, please have someone draft up a short speech for this function.  Regards Delainey 
 David, good to hear from you - I am sure we will cross paths in your career with Enron.  All the best Delainey 
 FYI see attached    Regards Delainey 
 Angela,  Is Dave supposed to be involved in this ?????  I just happened to be in Dave's email looking for something for him........I saw your name and thought maybe I'd better see if this was something I needed to put on his calendar.....As a rule, I do not go into Dave's  email unless I am told or looking for something that someone has requested me to print and give to him.....so, if you need something to be put on his calendar, please copy me on it or chances are I may or may not find out about it...  Thanks,  Kay 
 Stuart, only New Albany and Doyle would be left.  As you have indicated, Doyle is 100% committed to Ogelthorpe.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 fyi 
 Ben, please discuss with Dave Duran - he will be responsible for our coal generation strategy.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, I will try and call you on Monday - I spoke to Kish about Arcor - he is working on it.  Hang in there ....  Regards Delainey

 FYI/action re: DeMoes 
 You guys need to manage this....... 
  Thanks much guys - much appreciate it.  Have a good new year.  Dave 
  Dick, thanks for the e-mail.  I don't think I disagree with any of the points you made and I do think we have come a long way over the last year in the DSM "technology" we employ.  Unfortunately, a lot of these changes in thinking, sales and cost structure are too little too late.  It is highly unlikely at this point that EES will exist beyond next week.  All the best in the future and I would like to personally thank you for your contribution, thought process and caring to the end to make your point.  Regards Delainey 
  fyi 
   Ray, as per your request see attached::  The bottom line we will need approximately $82M for the month of December in order to maintain an asset worth approximately $375M.  The vast majority 80%+ is prepaid energy which will be recovered from the customer.  It is highly likely that we will be able to sell this book. 
 Guys, it would be great to be able to go off-site in two different locations for these guys but given the fact I had to personally buy the paper for copying the termination packages, I don't think there any funds to spend.  Perhaps there are empty offices in 3 Allen.  Please look into.  Either way we need to ensure that these guys are fairly well seperated.  I am waiting for a confidentiality from Calpine and AEP this AM.  Regards Delainey 
  ok to pay 
  Court would have to approve any reduction or significant change that we would do outside the normal course of business - short answer probably no on the non-compete otherwise we are down to 100 people have at it.  Regards Delainey

  Ray, in EES, the Construction Services (also known as EFS) companies operat= e on a stand alone basis from Enron and have clear liquidation value to the= parents - EES and Enron Corp.  It is my opinion that we should be trying t= o "un-buckle" these companies from Enron over the short term to ensure thei= r continued viablility as we find a sale.  In my view un-buckling means a) = stop the factoring of any Construction Services receivables that end up mov= ing cash out of Construction Services up into the parents; b) utilizing tho= se receivables plus, if necessary, Enron's interest in Construction Service= s to obtain sufficient collateral to renew the St. Paul surety bond.  This = surety bond is necessary to continue contracting; and c) terminate the swee= ping of cash from Construction Services bank accounts to Corp immediately. = There will be a meeting early next week with St Paul to renew the surety b= ond.  I am hopeful that meeting these conditions will be enough to reinstat= e the surety bond.  The Construction Services group employs approximately 2= ,600 people and is worth (given current backlog) between $100 and $125 mill= ion dollars.  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell over the next 6= 0 to 90 days and we control 100% of the stock of this company.  The other part half of the former EFS is the Facility Services group (also = know as ServiceCo). Again, these companies largely operate independently of= Enron and have going concern value outside of Enron.  Currently, we have o= utside technology and financial partners in the Facility Services Groups th= at make it impossible to factor receivables or move cash out of Facility Se= rvices bank accounts without the approval of the board which includes sever= al outside directors.  We currently own approximately 85% of the firm that = employs approximately 1,400 people and is worth minimum $50 million dollars= (cash value).  Mark and his team are actively trying to sell or otherwise = dispose over the next 60 to 90 days.  EES also manages several joint ventures (DSM and O&M related mostly) with c= ustomers where we would have to have outside approvals to move cash out of = these entities. These include Owens Corning Energy LLC (Owens Corning), LE = Hesten Energy LLC (Lily), Tenant Services Inc. (Simon Properties), EBC Prop= erty LLC and Enron Distributed Energy Services LLC.  In all cases, we need = to be observant of corporate governance issues with these entities.  As officers, I thought it prudent to ensure that you and your team had all = available information.  I would also like your approval to move forward wit= h my recommendations for the Construction Services group as above.  We appreciate everything you are doing.  Regards Dave Delainey

 guys, please ensure that this is handled.  Regards Delainey 
 Jen, probably done with ENE early in the new year and then determine next steps.  Take care.  Regards Dave 
 Jen, no calls from Sempra - I hear San Diego is nice:)  dave 
  Dan, are you managing or do we need to discuss?  Regards Delainey 
  OK 
 Jimmie, I assume that you and Tracey are formulating the options and populating the detailed financials on those options for the board meeting next week.  It would be great if we could see that a couple days in advance.  David, we should probably call a follow up board meeting for next Wednesday or Thursday.  Vicki, we need to speak about the board participation issues and the cash management issues discussed.  Regards Delainey 
 Thanks Judy - you are doing the right things and it is important!  Regards Dave 
 Kay, please set up a meeting to discuss in detail the Lily transaction and next steps - tomorrow or the next day.  Regards Delainey 
 Kalen/Dan, please provide guidance for Scott and let me know.  Scott, we are pretty much in a bind on most of this. I will see what we can do.  Regards Delainey 
 the knuckleheads still rule .... we are still here waiting .....  Dave 
  Mike, I would agree with your point that we will be attempting to sell the services (DSM/O&M) currently provided by EES to Hensen LLC.  Other than a heads up to Jimmie given the potential effects to EBSI, I am assuming that you and Jeremy et al are managing the sale.  Given the amount of work in front of Jimmie around EFS generally (sale of ConstructionCo and restructuring of ServiceCo, I would hope not to overload Jimmie on another sale process.  Thoughts?  Regards Delainey 
 What are we doing with Rexam?  Regards Delainey 
  David, I am ok anytime next Wed or Thursday. Just let Kay know. Thxs  Regards Delainey 
  Jimmie, agree; however, EES cannot immediately convey these agreements to EBSI as a sub-contractor permanently post bankruptcy. Under bankruptcy, we need to show an auction process.  In the cases, where EBSI has contracted directly with the client - I think we are ok.  Vicki please add some texture if required.  Regards Delainey 
  Guys, the plan,as I am currently aware:  a) Gas - as per our conversation this AM - press on; b) Power - start with the California customers post June and the Enron Direct books; c) follow on with the rest of the power book once we are getting traction on (b) above.  Thanks Dave 
 Vicki, I would have Janet, Dan, Jeremy, Scott.  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, .... starting to move.. have a few ideas .... the natives are restless... when are you returning to the mother ship?  Regards Delainey 
 Don, can you go through your Canadian gas book and let me know all the positions and customers.  We are planning on putting Enron Energy Services Canada into bankruptcy and need to understand the contracts.  Regards Delainey 
 ok 
 thank you 
  Deborah, I have received your letter dated December 18, 2001 and I will ensure that you get a follow up.  To give you a little texture on the issues, all pre-petition expense statements (Dec 2, 2001) were frozen subject to an overall approval by the bankruptcy court on what could be paid. At this point, we have approval to pay up to $5K immediately and possibly up to $15K per pre-petition expense statement. This part of the bankruptcy process.  It is actually harder to get pre-petition expenses paid than post-petition.  Unless I have my facts wrong, you should have been paid already or are in the queue.  Either Kalen or Dan will follow up.  If not please give me a call at 713-853-3829.  Regards Delainey 
 No bid for the barges:)  Better technology in the market regardless of price - these puppies are going to be tough to move.  Regards Delainey

Please clarify the following for me:  break out 2001 property premiums ($3M) for each major ENA asset ie) peaker, the ponderosa facility, LV Cogen and HPL/Hanover assets et al.  Wes, can you confirm for me that no insurance costs are embedded in the teams 2001 plans.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, Dave Duran agreed to reduce his plan to flat year on year for commercial expenses - can you reflect that in your sheets please.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and 2001 IT budget.  Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will be managed.  Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, any ideas?  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please set up a time for us to speak -- Bruce sorry for the delay - life has been a little hectic.  Don't ever hesitate to call, just have patience.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, can you send me hard copies - I am having trouble opening these reports.  Any summaries on the RTO filings?  Regards Delainey 
 The Strategy Meeting previously scheduled for tomorrow, November 14, 2000, has been cancelled.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call Kay @ 713-853-0643.   Thanks,  Dave 
 Jim, is there executive summaries for the following: a) Eastern Interconnect investigation  by region; and b) RTO's filings.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I think we should pass on the sponsorship of this event.  If you have a different view, lets discuss at your earliest convenience.  Thanks Delainey 
 Keep pushing these guys.  Regards Delainey 
 kay, see when this is and if I can go?  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal?  Regards Delainey 
 David, I don't know if you are the right person to speak with; however, I am looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related cost allocations to ENA for 2001.  We have been given allocation projections that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.  I would like to know how this was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions.  If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you please pass this on to the right spot.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Are you in? Time is a wasting..... Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, duly noted; however, there will be at this point no change in the scope and function of Redmond's group.  Thanks Delainey 
 Tim, lets not worry about margin at this point - we are trying to get a handle on headcount and direct expenses/capital charge first.  You will have your day in court to discuss margin soon.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, any help would be appreciated - we are very well positioned in the Florida market at this point.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget. Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks.  Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes.    Regards Delainey 
 Ike, sorry for the delay, it took us longer to deal with certain issues than expected.  I have faxed you a proposal.  Lets discuss at your earliest convenience.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Brian, good memo.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like you to consider the following people to provide the basis of your producer marketing team.  They are being re-deployed out of the upstream services group and have significant experience and relationships in the producer services market segment.  They can provide mid-market coverage, producer outsourcing, well-head purchases, etc.  As per our previous discussion, these folks will be your producer team and will provide all ENA's products to the segment.  Please keep this confidential - but please speak with Jean Mrha.  The names include: Linda Roberts - director - lead the central region; Mary Jo Johnson - manager - central region (wait until post HPL sale);  Jill Zivley - director -  lead the east region; Gary Bryan - director - east region; Jennifer Martinez - manager - east region; Bill Brogan - manager - east region; Kreg Hall - analyst - east region; Brian Riley - director - east region (wait until post HPL sale).  Both Brian and Mary Jo are inside HPL and if sold would interview with the buyer first and then would be available for ENA - lets wait on these folks until post sale.  Lets make a strong effort to accomodate these folks given their experience and availability.  Regards Delainey 
 Christi, please provide me with a timeline of when you expect to be filing protests against each utility.  As well, please ensure that both Kevin and I sign off on the filing before it goes out.  Regards

 Guys, great job - the Canadian office is still the model.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, fyi 
 Mark, fyi and between you and I.  Rob will always do the right thing - he is just a little more passionate than the average Enron guy.  Keep trying to build those bridges.  Regards Delainey 
 I stand corrected - we need to DASH everything over $500K.  Regards Delainey 
 Jane, we would like to go the Adjustment of Status route.  Regards Delainey 
 Great job - we all appreciate your management of the situation.  The A&A program is our most important asset.  Regards Delainey 
 Great job guys  - keep it coming!  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control. Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc.  A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish some of these goals as well.  In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a reasonable cut-off before this turns into an All-Employee meeting at the Hyatt.  John and I decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large visable budgets.  In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg for mid market and yourself for origination.  I hope this rationale will manage your issues.  If we invite Jake I think you do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room.  Lets discuss. Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that we are reaching these goals.  Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we watch the funds flow issues.  Regards Delainey 
 John, this is a Skilling issue - Charlene and myself are going to talk to him about several changes in the next couple of weeks.  Regards Delainey 
 Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the company we would be a $100 stock.  On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.  I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.  The goals of any restructuring are: a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the program; b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained; c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling and interviewing; d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly grounds the associate in the "Enron technology" which include skills in market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk; e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues; f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, retention and performance tool; g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, non-traditional sources of talent and h) increase cost effectiveness.  The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, people and teams, business tracks, etc.  I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.  I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with a strawman.  Let me know your thoughts.  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, thanks for the letter on Friday.  The team is preparing an analysis on where we have flexibility and preparing a response.  We should be able to respond before the end of the week.  Thanks Dave Delainey 
 David, i agree in principle with this process.  I assume that you and your team will implement.  Like we spoke about, I do not see a need to widely distribute this through the commercial organization.  I would just implement.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, Rob Milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the opportunity.  I would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks to meet Rob in Calgary to speak in detail about the role, the market and expectations.  I appreciate your openess and let me know how I can help.  The Ontario market is one of the best new market opportunities for ENA over the next year.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please forward to Max Yzaguirre.  The e-mail failed.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please forward to Scott Josey, John C Thompson and Julie Murray.  I could not find them on e-mail.  Regards Delainey 
 I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.  Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following: a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately; b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance.  Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.  Other identified action items from the meetings include: a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the July 19th meeting; b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to continue rotating within ENA; c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area; and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.  Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.  Regards Mark and Dave 
 Guys the PRC has been moved to 11:00.  Regards Delainey 
 By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted.  We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing, our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.  Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.  We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a success.   Sincerely,   Dave 
 This is a reminder for you to please take a minute and select your reviewers for the PRC feedback.  Dave is also requesting that you provide a list of accomplishments for the past six (6) months.  Please provide this information to your direct reports as soon as possible.  Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call Kay  3-0643.   Thanks,  Kay      -

 MEETING CANCELLED FOR FRIDAY MAY 19, 2000   This is a reminder !!!!!  There will not be a Friday Meeting today, May 19, 2000.  Date:  Friday May 19, 2000  Time:  2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location: 30C1  Topic:   Combined Staff and Budget Meeting   If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643) or Bev (3-7857).  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Rob, lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as part of the new A&A program being rolled out by the ENE Office of the Chair, a new Associate and Analyst PRC is being set up.  I have nominated you as the six people from ENA to be on this PRC.  You will represent ENA's A&A's and participate in the evaluation and ranking across the entire company.  This is a very important function - please represent us well.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you help Phillip out with this, I assume this has something to do with the 20/20 deal.  I believe a reserve should have been set up for this payment which was only designed to ensure that the transaction was accretive to NBPL.  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, great letter and arguement, I think the more public we can be on this one the better.  Thanks Dave 
 Gregg, please send a hard copy - the pdf file can not be opened on ENA systems in Houston.  Thanks Delainey 
 Jeff, as per our discussion, this would be a great opportunity for you to spend some time with and instill your vision for Enron to the leaders of the ENA organization.  I have attached a preliminary agenda which has you speaking to the group right after dinner the night of December 14th.  You have no time constraint on the length of your talk (ie) whatever you find find appropriate in order to get your message across.  I though it might be interesting for you to give your vision of Enron's 2001 goals, objectives and strategy.  As well, a brief business overview of EES, EBS and Networks may be valuable in building connections.    Regards Delainey 
 Please plan on attending and presenting.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, e-mail didn't pick up your name. You are invited as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Here you go.    Sorry, I have Enron Messaging working on it...But here you go for now..... 
 Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite. As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.  ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.  Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.    Regards Dave and John 
 Guys, updates to numbers given discussions at QBR's.    Regards Delainey 
 pls, forward these to Tammy Sheppherd to incorporate in the ENA OOC reports.  Regards Delainey 
 sound good mark thsx dave 
 Fran, can you speak to Brian on this issue.  Regards Delainey 
 David, thanks for the people listing.  Wes, we need 1999 and 2000 (including CE) ESA income statements for each market in as much detail as possible.   Looking for un-necessary overheads and where the income brightspots lie.  We would probably need the ESA 2001 budget (income, expense, cashflow and capital) for the trading/marketing/EES business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats.  A current balance sheet would be helpful as well.  I think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us.  You need to get your Visa issues worked out quickly - Kay can help.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim,  what ever you think is appropriate.  As far as the weekend, lets just play it by ear.  At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following discussions/agenda: a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & historical prices and volumes; b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation strategy; c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product development; and d) brief review of other S. American markets.  I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and any one else you think appropriate.  Let me know what I need to do otherwise.  Thanks  Regards Delainey 
 Looks good.  Regards Delainey 
 D'Arcy, sorry I missed you last week. I am going to be down in Rio mid November for some meetings with the S American team. Maybe we can have a discussion then?  I would very much like to get your opinion.  Regards Delainey 
 Colleen, thanks for the update - as another part of the nat gas value chain, traded transportation, with and without EOL should be a priority.  However, I think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the FERC that will allow the market to work.  Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately.  Thanks.  Regards Delainey

South America is going home & they are off tomorrow ----Thank= s,=20 kay   On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio= n,=20 announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20 operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha= t=20 are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b= asic=20 organizational framework has been set.=20  As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new= =20 responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and= =20 Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting= =20 to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility= ;=20 however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20 commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus = will=20 be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal= l=20 country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE= O=20 of Elektro until its ultimate sale.  The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20 Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in= =20 Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark= =20 Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a= nd=20 Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our= =20 reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20 managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset= s=20 are pursued.  The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20 America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo= rk=20 business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20 commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu= e=20 products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and= =20 enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.  In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report = to=20 Joe and Orlando: =20 The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will= =20 focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine= =20 natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:  ? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services= =20 needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20 capabilities; ? Providing those products and services across South America and across the= =20 value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value= =20 opportunity; ? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move= =20 quickly to capitalize; ? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20 overall risk of the organization; ? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri= ca=20 consistent with this strategy, and ? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de= al=20 flow.  The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w= ho=20 work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,= =20 capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio= n,=20 finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20  The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The= =20 team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book= =20 for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale= s=20 efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel= y=20 trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible= =20 for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct= =20 reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ= as=20 risk activities.  The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20 Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we= =20 will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. = =20  The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati= on=20 that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20 functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea= m=20 and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20 Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20 units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as= =20 well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20 infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements= =20 in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.  These groups include:  The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20 manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as= =20 governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate= ,=20 in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20 functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20 assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th= is=20 interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator= y=20 function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20 Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.  The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t= he=20 interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20 current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi= ll=20 also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20 assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the= =20 Cuiaba project.  The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and= =20 John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal= =20 requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20 Wholesale Services - Legal Department.  Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20 Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil= l=20 report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial= =20 functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20 relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron= =20 Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale= =20 Services =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.  These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20 reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20 financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new=20 organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20 region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly=20 affected will be notified shortly. =20 Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20 businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we ar= e=20 uniquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20 shareholder value.=20

 No Meeting This Week   This is a reminder !!!!!  There will NOT be a Friday Meeting October 27, 2000.    Date:  October 27, 2000 Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Guys, attached you will find the updated orig plan for Q4.  Trading income is slim pickings so far ..... we need some key deals of all sizes to close in the fourth quarter from your organizations.  Thanks Delainey 
 Tim, that will be fine.  This is a discussion topic that I want your input on for next year.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, don't worry about me - it worked out fine.  Just a bad day on the P/L side.  Thanks for leading some of these efforts it is often a thankless job.  Regards Delainey 
 sounds like a great idea  delainey 
 Guys, I spoke with Mark this morning.  He is very supportive of the structure and idea.  I had indicated that he would continue to run the producer services business in the West but would also be part of the overall team as we plot out strategy in the West.  He wants to stay in Denver which I think we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into the overall team.  I had indicated that we would consolidate market making into Houston and Paul Lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or not - if so he needs to move to Houston.  Phillip/Barry, go ahead and start working with Mark as you develop your plans going forward.  I will be speaking to Stephanie Miller this week and will give the green light with her shortly.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I would start focusing some attention on gas at this point.  When we get together I would like to sit down and go through a number of organizational re-alignments and what we may want to do on the regulatory front to support those businesses.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi  Dave 
 Barry, I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week.  I would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators (internal or external?) to complement.  I would start thinking about how to get that done.  I would call Oxley for help if needed.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, lets get together in the next week or so to discuss progress.  In the meantime, what are we doing with regard to FERC 637 to ensure that we have favourable rules in the trading of natural gas transportation capacity?  Do we have a master summary of the RTO proposals submitted last week?  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however, assuming a fixed amount of the "internal" legal costs are fairly represented by this allocation as ENA's "capacity" charge, you are correct.  This number will be in the P/L under your name.  The "outside" legal costs should be tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I need an estimate of the quarterly "capacity charge" for ENA and an estimate of outside legal costs by business unit.  Regards Delainey 
 David, can you point D'Arcy in the right direction in ENA or ESA.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, anything you can do to encourage your employees to take a little time to participate in the survey would be much appreciated.  This is a valuable exercise for the company.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, if you or any of you people have interest in attending please contact Wendy Roy.  Regards Delainey 
 fine 
 Strike One!  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, reference to a) below has to do with the legal budget.  Sorry for the lack of clarity.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, couple of points - a) please check spelling and typos closely and b) in the first paragraph of the second page starting "The Commercial Origination...." should end with ".... knowledge necessary to reach our goals."  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, hold off until I let you know to go.  Thanks dave 
 Guys, notes from the morning meeting.  Please review and comment.  Specific action items: a) i)further calculation of ENA/Non- ENA capacity charges, ii) estimation of outside legal and iii) formulation of charge out/feedback process to the business units; b) need budget/review for competitive analysis, technical and restructuring.     Regards Delainey 
 Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible to get this out of either the trading or origination group.  As a significant contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room. Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely linked to specific legislation or policy.  This may not be the answer you want; however, I am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, I would let this fish go.  He has been through the organization too many times.  Regards Delainey 
 Rodney, if this deal is such a long put why did you push me into this process?  You should have made the call to kill it.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find the final plan to meet our origination targets for Q4 consistent with our discussions.  It is important that we hit our numbers in order for Enron to meet its targets for the year.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your capabilities better than ours.  In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric contract.  The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW of power.  I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP controls in the nation.  The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.  I spoke to him yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.  Joe is a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.  It may be a good lead into the health care segment.  Regards Delainey 
 Eric, as per my discussion with Rob, I believe that the site has the most value to us given its location and capability.  I would continue to actively develop that site for a variety of turbine technologies.  As far as the turbines, I would probably exit them in the most opportune manner.  Regards Delainey 
 REMINDER -----TODAY 3:00 PM   Dave would like to have a strategy meeting next Tuesday  October 17, 2000, from 3:00-5:00 pm in room 30C1. No preparation is necessary and it's important that each of you plan to attend.  If you cannot attend, please contact Dave directly.  Laura - Video Conf.  Frank Vickers - - Video Conf. Barry Tycholiz--  Video Conf. 
 Guys, what is your plan?  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board meetings and PRC's.  Lets set up this discussion with the following points: a) we are not exiting Argentina; b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business opportunity; c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision making and greater communication; d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao Paulo.  Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina - its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business model we are trying to move forward.  Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and Orlando as part of this process.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA point of view.  The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project. The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M. the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, venture capital and the "organizing group" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.  Regards Delainey 
 Rodney, from what you told me it sounds like GE is willing to play on the Selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed.  Can you answer Marty's other questions?  Regards Delainey 
 Marty, no agenda on this one at all.  Given, the change in Enron Industrial Markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on the outsourcing product, I just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.  I believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other priorities they would like to transition the deal to EES.  Ultimately, the value (TCV, earnings, up-sell, resume) would benefit Enron more in EES than ENA.  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, what is the cost basis in these turbines?  Regards Delainey 
 Jana, I had a late request from the Portland team to nominate a person, I don't think that Janet would mind letting them nominate this person.  If I am incorrect Janet let me know.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter or so.  Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some value for Enron to take this deal including: a) $200 M in TCV for 2000; b) $3 to $5 M in value; c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the large industrial customers; and d) provides an "in" to the GE family of companies which could result in significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick, I have signed the DASH. Good job.  One comment, the DASH for Basic particularily the RAC comments was very poorly written.  Please keep an eye on this for me.  Regards Delainey 
 John, I don't get it - are they trading gas and power.   I thought this was= =20 your group?  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, please provide Jana with your choice of person ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, do you have a home for this guy - he desperately wants to stay in S. America.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, it is all yours please communicate ASAP to Jana Jovanni in the A&A program.  Regards Delainey 
 This is a reminder that your QBR has been scheduled for  Monday October 23, 2000.    Date:  Monday October 23, 2000  Time:  9:00 - 11:00am  Location 3321  Topic:  QBR    If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.   Thanks,  Kay 
 This is a reminder that your QBR has been scheduled for  Monday October 23, 2000, in conf room 3321. Please be prepared to discussed:  A) QBR l.  Portfolio Review-Raptor/Non Raptor   B) 2001 Business Plan    If you have any questions/conflicts, please feel to contact me at 853-0643.   Thanks,  Kay 
 Guys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $100M in nominal value): a) 2 power barges - Brian - $13M b) 2 ABB 11N1 - Rob- $35M c) 1 501D5A - Janet/Chris - $25M d) 1 7EA - Janet/Chris- $20M  All other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects. Could you please provide me your plan with these units.  I would like to flatten out our book (ie) ensure there are good homes for or divest of all our existing turbines before we look at purchasing additional units for 2002.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, what is the status of this turbine - would we be able to turn it back in exchange for foregoing on the ld's?  Or do we want this turbine?  Regards Delainey 
 David, do we need to "volunteer" people to participate?  Do we want a more structured process?  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 FYI 
 Guys, what is this!!!!  No - I think that Ahlstrom should take this risk or it should be reflected in a price reduction. I vote not to do the deal otherwise.  Regards Delainey 
 Please mark on your calendars to attend given current discussions about the gas organization.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, please mark your calendars for the 2000 ENA Management Offsite scheduled for December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  We envision people flying in the afternoon/evening of December 13th with the offsite being held on December 14th and 15th.  Departure would occur the morning of December 16th.  It is important that everyone stays for the entire period including Friday night.  Jeff Skilling and Greg Whalley have taken time out their schedule to speak to us on Thursday and Friday night about Enron Corps strategy and our eCommerce/Networks strategy respectively.  A complete agenda will follow shortly.  Dorie Hitchcock will manage all the logistics.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick, you are doing the right things - if you run into timing issues in the future do not hesitate to give me a call directly.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I'm not picking on you - I just can't believe legal and corporate let this go through. Sorry.  By the way, Redmond will take responsibility for the Pan Nat arbitration as per our discussion.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, do you have a deal book -explaining the overall transaction, returns and risk?  This will help me facilitate the process.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I completely disagree with legals position.  I have difficulty with some of our VP's having signing authority.  I believe this is a significant control issue.  Mark, is this widespread in ENA?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the Hot List for each business unit.  The performance of your group is key to making our targets for Q4 and to meet budgeted origination performance for the year.  Independent of specific budgets for the groups, the origination organization needs to generate $250M for Q4.  Ultimately, a strong performance in Q4 by the origination organization will help build momentum into the year-end PRC.  I will be setting up time with each of you to go through your numbers and specifics on the deals.    Regards Delainey 
 sure, just set up with kay  thxs dave 
 Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.  In order to reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups and managers have very low participation rates.  I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80% participation (ie) the "unhappy" folks are more likely to input info than the "happy" folks.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, hopefully we can convince you to come when we re-schedule - seemed like an easy call.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, he can approve but can't sign as a director. You need to continue to manage. This would take a board resolution to change (ie) he can not bind the company as a director.  Regards Delainey 
 Please be sure your are in attendance or let me know if you can't attend so that I can make Dave aware.  This is a reminder !!!!!  There will be a Friday Meeting October 13, 2000.    Date:  October 13, 2000 Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Rick, I have been having discussions with both Joe Deffner and Jean Mrha on this one.  Clearly, this is a commercial banking product in which we have little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or collateral (reserve risk).  Ultimately, I have challenged the Upstream Group to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave would like to have a strategy meeting next Tuesday  Ocotober 10, 2000 from 2:30-4:30 in room 30C1. No preparation is necessary and it's important that each of you plan to attend. If you cannot attend, please contact Dave directly.   Thanks! 
 Ike, is the president and CEO of TVA.  FYI  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective communication tool.  I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are going.  Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Jeff, can you speak briefly with Kevin on this one - intriguing idea if the execution was probable.  By the way, what is our plan with Sithe?  Regards Delainey 
 Rick which meeting are you refering to?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, it will be very difficult to get money out of the power group - is the expectation that I come up with the dollars - just curious.  Are we not circumventing the spirit of the political contribution rules?  Regards Delainey 
 I am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting.  I just think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with families.  The drive to Galveston and back - the overnight babysitter - the potential trouble that may result in close quarters and hours of drinking et al.  I prefer the original idea at Enron Field.  Regards Delainey 
 Kevin, how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company?  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas and power business.  Rather, my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and generate deal flow.  As well, to reduce the conflict between the trading and origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the market than focused on internal issues.  As far as specifics, you will have to wait and see.  Thanks Delainey 
 Chris, you are officially the king today!  With the PSCo deal this effectively eliminates the LM position assuming we successfully sell LV.  Regards Delainey 
 Oz, David is interested in the fuel cell business, do you need his skill set?  Regards Delainey 
 Erin, don't want to keep passing the ball;however, this is a retail opportunity in almost all states (ie) railroad demand is classified as retail customers under most IOU tariffs.  I would ask Harold Buchanan  Regards Delainey 
 Sounds reasonable. 
 Charlene, the 2nd is ok. Either Mark, myself or John should probably be able to do the 28th as well.  Obviously, we strongly believe in the benefit of the program and its goals - ultimately, we  have to walk the talk! Regards Delainey 
 Charlene, that will be fine... on a different note, where are you on the straw man we spoke about.  Ultimately, I would like to continue to push this with the leadership team.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you forward your parts.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, no hi or goodbye - you are losing your Canadian politeness :)  On a serious note, you are doing the right thing for the company and for Barry's career.  This will be a good opportuntity for him to get to the next level if he makes it happen.  As you are aware, I will aggressively support you and the Toronto iniative. Let me know.  Regards Delainey 
 Updated draft memo.    Regards Delainey 
 Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility? Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated structure in the RFP?  Is this a play that you would support?  On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.  How is it going otherwise?  Regards Delainey 
 Marion, the leads include Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan in the Eastern Origination Group and Michael L Miller in the Principal Investing Group.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical feedstocks into industrial gases.  He wants to establish the technology in Baytown and is looking for our assistance and capital.  This is probably a stretch but it may be worthwhile for you to speak with him.  I am not advocating this play just passing on the message.  Steve Paras 718-630-5611  He will be in Houston on Friday.  Regards Delainey 
 Mary, none outside of Enron plans.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, this sounds like an ambush..... :) 
 Guys, assuming that we receive $7M for the 6B's what is our cost basis in the Barges?  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I am not sure that this will attract the people we want to hear the message; however, I will hold back judgement until we discuss the strategy in more detail.  Regards Delainey 
 Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the current deal on the table is a bad one.  I believe that RAC should provide a clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient.  It is too easy to state the obvious.  Regards Delainey 
 David, you may be getting to the nub here.  Ultimately, this is a lot more art than science.  It will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision rule to manage this process.  I am looking to the opinions of yourself, Ray, Dick and Jeff, given the facts in each case, does this appear to be a good trade given the market, the specifics of the company, the carrying costs of the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return assets (ROCE >25%).  This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that comes from this group.  As a result, I need to have a positve consensus from this group in each case.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?  My understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.  Is this correct?  I may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie) no more 6B's or barges.  Regards Delainey 
 Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.  Regards Dave and John 
 David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH. Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given the possible recovery of this sector?  The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy prices.  Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?  Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, I think we should take a quick review of the existing PI portfolio to see where we are and where we want to go - we have with the completion of FCEL made a tremedous amount of investment in a very short period of time >$60 to $80M.  I would like to  hear how we are moving to monetize more mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage investments.  I don't want to approve any further investments until we have had such a discussion.  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday; but I understand your position.  In the interest of facilitating continuing dialogue and perhaps giving you our view on how we analyze such positions, I will send you our document.  I would suggest that we try to set up a follow up meeting in early October once you have completed your work.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 This is a reminder !!!!!  There will be a Friday Meeting September 29th, 2000.    Date:  September 29, 2000 Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Guys, can you give me an update on what this deal is about - e-mail would be fine?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, how are the business units doing on the "talent pipeline" since we have put this on auto-pilot?  Is HR still providing resumes?  Regards Delainey 
 Bruce, obviously ENA does not have a problem with this.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, this sounds good.  It would be helpful for us (the overall power business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.  I think we all believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and rewarded.  Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions and origination; and d) EOL customer sign-ons and deal flow.  I look forward to sitting down to discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 John, completely agree with your view - David, I would have the matrix, with all of the ENA statistics and names, ready for distribution on Friday to the key managers to try and illicit a response from the low participation folks.  Regards Delainey 
 ok with me 
 Guys, please take a read of the draft memo - would like to send out tommorrow.    Regards Delainey 
 John, I think you may want to be part of this.  Regards Delainey 
 Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I think it works welll in allocating resources between competing "going concerns" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly effectively.  Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of time on this.  Regards Delainey 
 Thanks 
 Chris, as per our discussion, I just want to confirm that we have the ability to break the contract with the EPC provider at any time.  Further, I want to confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the short run value of the project.  In other works, we have no intention of lifting their offer.  Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines.  These guys add no value and they are killing me!  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA could create significant value from a project that we have very little invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant dollars or taking significant risks.  Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.  Regards Delainey 
 Krista , you are very welcome - best of luck in the future.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I have forwarded your binder to David Oxley to set up a meeting for the wholesale group to discuss appropriate homes for your people.  It has taken a little longer than expected to get people together but we are making progress.  It may be helpful for you to identify, like Abe, where these folks would like to go if they had their druthers.  It may be worthwhile for us to have a quick phone call to discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Ok - you got the ball.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, part of this deal is repayment of the sub debt at par and a series of cashflows that we would probably like to monetize.  Have you looked at this?  Jeff, I would like to get your view on the economics - basically they are giving us 89% of our carry value in cash and 11% of our carry value in a contingent payment payable at restructuring or sale of their partnership. Lets discuss ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 good job - keep them coming!  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, can you set up a dinner with Randall.  Thanks 
 Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on Wednesday.  Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so that we can ensure that we are comparing "apples to apples".  I would also suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers. It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties settlement offer.  I am in the office over the next several days. Lets discuss at your earliest convenience.    Regards Dave Delainey 
 Christi, I was unable to open the file can you please send a hard copy.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits: a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues they are having with GE and b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission correlating into increased operating hours.  I need two things to determine if we want to move forward: a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?  I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.  Regards Delainey 
 Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology. Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value or multiple value based on 90 degree output.  I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.  The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.  My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.  Regards Delainey 
 Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real knowledge of the potential deal.  Likely this originates at the local level and is probably a long put.  Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more detail over the next week.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as usual the investment is subject to RAC review and a DASH.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward under the structure we have discussed.  FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that vest based upon 60MW of orders; - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that call; - the transaction is fully press released immediately.  CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW; - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.  I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.  Thanks Delainey 
 Guys, HR should be in touch with you with regard to a couple of people that I have agreed to take from CALME:  Donahue  - Maria Elena Garcia - Director; Duran   - Boris Feschiev - Manager; - Mark Provenzano - Manager.  Regards Delainey 
 ok 
 This is a reminder !!!!!  There will Not be a Friday Meeting September 22nd, 2000.    Date:   Off Week  Time: Location:  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 FYI 
 Randall, I appreciate the invite - I would like to continue to be involved. It was a pleasure to meet you and your team.  The several things on my radar screen with Bridgeline include: a) improving the financial performance of the entity; b) ensuring that the risk management and trading capability and structure matches ENA's technology, structure, systems, accountability and policies in every manner.  In my view, this is not a negotiable item and will only benefit Bridgeline on a go forward basis; c) continue to move from the "heavy lifting" approach to becoming the "smartest pipe" that can harness improved returns by capitalizing on your people, your information advantage and I believe somewhat of a first mover advantage given the continued consolidation of the intrastate competitors (ie) Entergy/Koch/FPL. We will be very supportive of innovative and aggressive positions that are well thought out and downsides defined; and d) increasing the underlying liquidity of our capital position in Bridgeline.  My time and resources are at your disposal.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, agree with you - why don't you set up some time for us to speak and go through the Regulatory report and iniatives.  Regards Delainey 
 David, on a go forwards basis, please ensure that there is a technical sign off on the principal investments DASH.  I would like either Bob Virgo or Wayne Mays to have a look at these investments from a technical due diligence point of view and to be on side before the investment is made.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will better reflect my thinking around this investment.  The current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in the fund.  I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.  I would suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:  It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is important for the following reasons: a) provides an additional "Friend of Enron" to facilitate short to medium term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity and capital transactions in the wholesale group; b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.  ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.  Regards Delainey 
 ???? 
 Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating. In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.  Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the East.  Regards Delainey 
 pls set up 
 ok if Mark is ok.  Regards Delainey 
 You caught us .... 
 Don, NewPort Generation has called me interested in the plants.  Regards Delainey 
 FYI Lets discuss Regards Delainey 
 Mike, this appears to be a very reasonable settlement - proceed on this basis.  I assume this keeps my number in and around the $600 to $615MM for the 2000's all in.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please find room 
 Good note - don't think I could do better in style or timing! Regards Delainey 
 Jeff Ader is looking for a reserved parking spot.  He is presently parking on the Blue level and would like to have a reserved spot due to his frequent traveling and customer appointments that warrant his leaving the building, thus loosing his parking space.  Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  Regards,  Kay   3-0643 
 Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not execute the gas balancing arrangement.  The parties should continue to operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute the agreement or put it in the data room.  We should represent to potential buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market.  All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities (including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, FYI - Ben, can you follow up with this person with our interest or lack thereof whichever is applicable.  Regards Delainey 
 Successfully, missed another bullet !!!  I have meetings set up with Mariel= la=20 (the lady you like) and Dan Castingnola, who are the two highest ranked=20 performers in CALME, to see if they are interested in joining our team. =20  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, gas with a $5.00 handle is not a good thing for this deal - I know we are pushing this restructuring as fast as we can; however, I think we need to determine how to move this faster. Any ideas?  Regards Delainey 
 Jennifer, is there another time?  Regards Delainey 
 Tom , I appreciate the e-mail - sorry for the delay in response.  I am on-side with all your points.  On the New Albany retrofit, I want to ensure that I am not replacing one patent problem with another so a clear "title" up front on the new equipment will be important.  However, I will be interested in hearing your solution especially if it can further reduce NOX and increase our operating hours.  I share your interest in the FT-4 project hopefully we can take that to the next level.  Please stay in contact.  Regards Delainey 
 Tammy, are you getting all these reports?  Regards Delainey 
 Jen, I would be pleased to attend - sorry for the delay on the e-mail.  Kay, please set up.  Regards Delainey 
 David, how are we making out with this item?  Regards Delainey 
 Carol, I believe Hunter is leading the charge on building the gas fundamentals group.  Regards Delainey 
 David , if this is going to cause you political flack with Mary Joyce lets just kill it - we have revised the original plan and this is probably not needed.  Regards Delainey 
 Janelle, I was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your thoughts on your current role.  I have heard you are considering global fuels and Lagrasta's business.  I would like to give you my perspective on the future vision for power and the overall organization including gas mid-market.  Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the primary growth engine for Enron Corp over the next several years.  Kay, can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience.  Regards Delainey 
 As per our discussion. 
 Kay, can you set up a one hour to half an hour with each if possible.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Guys, ENA will take responsibility for the two 7EA's.  We do not currently have any projects for the Westinghouse 501D5A's.  However, I do not know what Bowen's view might be for EIM or Haug's for CALME.  Regards Delainey 
 Patience my friend - before a meaningful change can occur in the A/A program some of the changes in the EI groups need to be resolved.  That process is underway - I envision taking a comprehensive solution to Jeff towards the end of this quarter with Charlene on side.  I will discuss with you when I have more details.  Regards Delainey 
 Attorney-Client Protected  Kevin, If we respond to the RFP with what we believe to be market prices and values and they don't accept it - does that not support a case where damages from the MOPA , for that 500 MW, can be defined to be equal to or lower than our submission.  Regards Delainey 
 Rick, it looks like the number is approximately down $198MM.  What is the drill?  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, go ahead and set up the meeting.  Delainey 
 Kevin, shouldn't we participate in this RFP? Regards Delainey 
 I don't think we can accomodate that request.  :)  Regards Delainey 
 Don, give Harry some $$'s Regards Delainey 
 Chuck, I appreciate the note - I just like to ensure that everyone is aware of the various issues and that we are managing our risk appropriately.  I have a great deal of confidence that you have this handled.  Regards Delainey 
 It is the intent of the Office of the Chairman to maintain a high quality flow of Analysts and Associates rotating through Enron North America as well as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:  Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other departments Recent successes and current projects Ideas on the horizon Opportunities in your business unit for AA's The benifits of rotation in your business unit An open Q&A session  These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between 12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.  Dave 
   The meeting for Friday September 1, 2000 has been cancelled.    This is a reminder !!!!!  There will Not be a Friday Meeting September 1, 2000.

 Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this is a venture we should support.  In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.  These units are fully mobile via the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable. The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.  The benefits include: a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, Capstone and Elektryon; b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer applications; c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.  If ENA through this venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk; d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology did not work or the market did not materialize; e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology; and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.  However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the technology proves out.  Given, that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.  Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.  We have a very solid history with this company.  They have successfully solved many of the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently operating at New Albany.  They would bring the technical and engineering expertise at cost for their 50%.  ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause at a fixed number for their 50% .  If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I will set up a meeting.  Regards Delainey 
 Hey, you guys are copying my model!  Congrats  Regards Delainey 
 Barry, we currently have six folks coming who all golf:  - Barry - Lavo - Delainey - Ozzie - Milly - Yzaguirre  I would say we should golf everday. I will get Kay to forward travel schedules to you so that we can set up times where everyone can play as much as possible.  My understanding is that we are all staying at the Mirage.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, it is my understanding that the incremental $5 MM in gas V@R, under an interim authority, expires today.  Given current market conditions, I would request  an extension of that interim limit - $45MM in total gas V@R for an additional two weeks starting today.  Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional permanent increases for gas and power V@R particularily given the Alberta PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the winter season.  I will take your lead on this one.  Regards Delainey 
 thanks Ray  Delainey 
 Guys, can you come explain some of this to me including where we stand on the GE issues.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please book 9:00 am to 2:00 pm with me Mike Miller & Don Miller with Mike Childers (Entergy) (actually 10 am to 1pm not including travel time to their shop in the Woodlands) on September 5, 2000.  Regards Delainey 
 Scott, great job - looking for more. Regards Delainey 
 Ben, any thoughts? 
 Rebecca, I am fine with this; however, Lavorato has was spelled wrong.  Regards Delainey 
 Tammy, are you getting copies of all these reports for the book?  Regards Delainey 
 Adam, thanks for the response, I guess it is a good thing for Enron that we didn't do this deal with TXU.  Nevertheless, I hope that we can find a way through this without significantly impairing value for ENA.  The ENA team will work with you on this item;however, I need your committment to try and keep us whole as much as possible.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, keep the pressure on these guys; but, I think Adam is in a corner and does not have a lot of flexibility.  Regards Delainey 
 Rebecca, looks fine to me.  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, I appreciate the offer - I  hope you didn't have to promise your first born since I was basically giving you a hard time.  I may take you up on this next season.  Regardless, I appreciate all the good work you and your team are doing.  Regards Delainey 
 Just a reminder, the East Midstream QBR will be held tomorrow....

I will look forward to seeing you there. 
 This is the original memo sent to all the committee members from Dave.  I then sent out another one cancelling the Staff Meeting for all those not included in this memo. I also sent out a memo regarding the newly formed ENA Management Committee,  including the assistants,  so everyone would be on board.  Let me know if this isn't what you needed.  Thanks,  Kay 
 Adam, I believe that we have formally responded to all your issues as per your memo to me of August 8, 2000. In all or almost all cases, we have accepted your position.  The agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten.  I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the case.  The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron Wind.  In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction with ENA versus TXU.  I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick, you need to agree with Max on the scope to be provided by the OE - I expect high quality service for the money we are paying.  The deal on Friday is completely dependent on a pre-arranged scope and a minimum quality of service.  I expect high quality EE&CC  people to be proactively managing cost and exposure and to be there for the whole process - no pulls to other business lines.  If Max or Virgo are not happy I am not happy.  I make money you make money.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Regards Delainey 
 Paul, sorry for the delay in responding, I do not have a direct relationship with anyone in Reliant or TXU; however, Jim Ducote and Janet Dietrich may be the best spots in Enron to pursue.  Regards Delainey 
 Adrian, you are very welcome  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, that is correct. See you then Regards Delainey 
 Guys, we appreciate your efforts on this project but we will not be needing your services as owners engineer on the Vitro project.  I will honor our agreement on the sell down; however, we have sufficient technical talent internally and externally to manage this job.  I see very little effort in continuing to waste internal time in ENA and EECC on this discussion.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, I thought I would send you a copy of the East Mid-Market QBR to give you a view on what Presto/Baughman are doing.  The West historically has been far better than the East in covering the market and generating mid market deals/services.  I look forward to our discussion in Portland next week.  I would like to get a perspective on organization, market approach, deal flow, resources, products and coverage for the Mid-Market group at that meeting.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, we need your final review on next years budget (direct expense) for MW Gas (Luce) and LT Gas Fundamentals/Transport Capacity (Gomez) done today.  We are running out of time to finalize the budgeting process.  I would much appreciate your assistance.  Regards Delainey 
 David, I would change John Thompson and Ed Baughman to strong. Thxs Delainey 
 Mike, lets discuss just after Wayne and I get together to discuss the technical book or in conjunction.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, where are we on gas interconnect?   I am hearing rumblings of 15 year Kern exposure - don't  know if I like that.  Regards Delainey

 Dave has reserved a Plane to take all of you to Las Vegas for the Offsite, December 13th.  We have no idea  what time the PRC will be over; however, at the conclusion of the PRC everyone should plan to go straight to the Hanger to board the aircraft.  I just got confirmation last night that I have the plane, so I really don't have any details at this point.  As soon as I get the information, I will make packets for each of you with directions to the hanger.  We are asking that you make your own reservations for the return since everyone will be leaving at different times.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.  Thanks,  Kay  3-0643

 Guys, my suggestion would be that RAC should manage the overall monitoring responsibility for ENA;however, I assume that Janet and Chris will continue to be responsible for the ENA turbine book.  They should be actively managing and monitoring ENA's piece.  Regards Delainey 
 John, if we invite Scott then I think we have to add Eric Thode(PR/IR); however, everyone would be in!!  What do you think?  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, can you make sure I am available 
 This is it.  So sorry I left you name off.  Kay

 Mark, this is great - giving the increased exposure/politics in some of these markets it makes a lot of sense.  Regards Delainey 
 As part of the restructuring between ENA and Global Markets and consistent with the view to increase our focus on building our core gas and power business, we have decided to re-formulate the ENA Management Committee.  As part of this change, each of you are invited to participate in dialogue and decisions which will impact the overall course of our business. Ultimately, this group is responsible for the overall financial performance and strategic direction of ENA.  The only structural committment to your time will be a pre-scheduled Management Committee meeting every second Friday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM until 4:30PM in 30 C2 (video conference room).  The Portland, Canadian and Mexican offices can connect via video conference.  The meetings wil focus on financial targets, deal flow, market opportunities, staffing and strategic direction.  The first meeting will be scheduled on this Friday.  Everybody should make a serious committment to attend, to stay for the entire meeting and to be on time.  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, I am in favour.  Regards Delainey 
 Wayne, that would be fine.  Regards Delainey 
 Please note time change for the QBR to be held on Friday, August 18th.  It will be from 8:30 am to 11:30 am so that we can have the Friday afternoon budget and staff meeting.  The QBR will be held in EB3321.  Thanks. 
 Guys, this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group. I think this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.  We need to bring more people "in" which should increase their accountability for ENA results overall, improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to evaluate future leaders.  Trading   Origination  Country Managers  Support   Executive  Belden    Dietrich   Milnthorp   Colwell    Frevert Presto    Calger   Yzaguirre   Beck    Delainey Arnold    Duran       Oxley    Lavorato Neal    Bowen       Haedicke Shively    Donahue      Murray Allen    Mrha Martin    Redmond  I would like to send out a note this week to communicate whatever we come up with in order to have the right folks available on Friday.  Look forward to your comments.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.  It is not a bad model just a different one.  Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall Street.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, any thoughts - do we have excess development staff - this would be a good opportunity for the brave at heart.  Regards Delainey

 Jeff, you are killing me - we targeted that group specifically to build the risk business in gas and east power in the short run.  This was well planned effort.  Regards Delainey

 Larry, go get 'em.  Whatever you can get you can keep and reduce the fee. You could make this easy for both of us.  Regards Delainey 
 Margaret, what is involved with this Permanent Residency application?  How does it change my status as a non-immigrant resident?  Regards Delainey 
 Dave would like to cancel the bloomberg program that he presently has on his computer.  Can you do this for him or can you direct me to the proper person ?  Thanks for your help.   Kay 713-853-0643 
 Janet, get rid of these LM's - too many cooks! Regards Delainey 
 Pretty quiet on the EcoGas/Kafus front...... whats up?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like to schedule a quarterly meeting to review our technical risk as a part of this reporting procedure.  Wayne can you set up a meeting for the four of us over the next few weeks.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, thanks for the message. It has been my experience that people who have had experience in our trading, mid market and structuring groups have a better overall understanding of how Enron (ECT or ENA) looks at value and manages risk.  Personally, this is the track I took which included a very solid foundation in accounting, operations, trading, structuring and then ultimately in origination.  I hope this helps.  Regards Delainey
