 Guys, here are the details on the ESA MEH turbines - please forward to me your project details, economics and strategy ASAP.  We will allocate these turbines to the project with the best strategic/economic rationale once confirming that they are worth more in ENA versus ESA.  If you need more detailed information on these turbines please let me know.  Rob, please give me call on this one.  Regards Delainey

 Mike, can you keep the approval amount under $20M? Regards Delainey 
 Paul, thanks for the note.  Please clarify the following for me:  break out 2001 property premiums ($3M) for each major ENA asset ie) peaker, the ponderosa facility, LV Cogen and HPL/Hanover assets et al.  Wes, can you confirm for me that no insurance costs are embedded in the teams 2001 plans.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, Dave Duran agreed to reduce his plan to flat year on year for commercial expenses - can you reflect that in your sheets please.  Regards Delainey 
 Wes, can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and 2001 IT budget.  Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will be managed.  Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, any ideas?  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please set up a time for us to speak -- Bruce sorry for the delay - life has been a little hectic.  Don't ever hesitate to call, just have patience.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, can you send me hard copies - I am having trouble opening these reports.  Any summaries on the RTO filings?  Regards Delainey 
 The Strategy Meeting previously scheduled for tomorrow, November 14, 2000, has been cancelled.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call Kay @ 713-853-0643.   Thanks,  Dave 
 Jim, is there executive summaries for the following: a) Eastern Interconnect investigation  by region; and b) RTO's filings.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I think we should pass on the sponsorship of this event.  If you have a different view, lets discuss at your earliest convenience.  Thanks Delainey 
 Keep pushing these guys.  Regards Delainey 
 kay, see when this is and if I can go?  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be able to achieve this goal?  Regards Delainey 
 David, I don't know if you are the right person to speak with; however, I am looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related cost allocations to ENA for 2001.  We have been given allocation projections that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.  I would like to know how this was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions.  If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you please pass this on to the right spot.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Are you in? Time is a wasting..... Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, duly noted; however, there will be at this point no change in the scope and function of Redmond's group.  Thanks Delainey 
 Tim, lets not worry about margin at this point - we are trying to get a handle on headcount and direct expenses/capital charge first.  You will have your day in court to discuss margin soon.  Regards Delainey 
 Dan, any help would be appreciated - we are very well positioned in the Florida market at this point.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget. Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks.  Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes.    Regards Delainey 
 Ike, sorry for the delay, it took us longer to deal with certain issues than expected.  I have faxed you a proposal.  Lets discuss at your earliest convenience.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Brian, good memo.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like you to consider the following people to provide the basis of your producer marketing team.  They are being re-deployed out of the upstream services group and have significant experience and relationships in the producer services market segment.  They can provide mid-market coverage, producer outsourcing, well-head purchases, etc.  As per our previous discussion, these folks will be your producer team and will provide all ENA's products to the segment.  Please keep this confidential - but please speak with Jean Mrha.  The names include: Linda Roberts - director - lead the central region; Mary Jo Johnson - manager - central region (wait until post HPL sale);  Jill Zivley - director -  lead the east region; Gary Bryan - director - east region; Jennifer Martinez - manager - east region; Bill Brogan - manager - east region; Kreg Hall - analyst - east region; Brian Riley - director - east region (wait until post HPL sale).  Both Brian and Mary Jo are inside HPL and if sold would interview with the buyer first and then would be available for ENA - lets wait on these folks until post sale.  Lets make a strong effort to accomodate these folks given their experience and availability.  Regards Delainey 
 Christi, please provide me with a timeline of when you expect to be filing protests against each utility.  As well, please ensure that both Kevin and I sign off on the filing before it goes out.  Regards 
 No Meeting This Week   This is a reminder !!!!!  There will NOT be a Friday Meeting November 10, 2000.    Date:  November 10, 2000  (cancelled) Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Dorie, as per our discussion.  For the Friday night speaker, can you give me an idea of price and availability for the following:  - Joe Gibbs - Lou Holtz - Mike Krzynewski - Joe Paterno - James Carville  The topic would be leadership and motivation.    Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I assume that you will have a complete headcount and a revised 2001= =20 expense/revenue/capital budget available in the next week or so.  I would= =20 also like to know what your HR plan might be given these changes.  David=20 Oxley will the help with the HR issues and Wes Colwell with the budget issu= es.  No turning back gentlemen.

 Kay, can you handle this stuff for me. thxs  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, great job - the Canadian office is still the model.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, fyi 
 Mark, fyi and between you and I.  Rob will always do the right thing - he is just a little more passionate than the average Enron guy.  Keep trying to build those bridges.  Regards Delainey 
 I stand corrected - we need to DASH everything over $500K.  Regards Delainey 
 Jane, we would like to go the Adjustment of Status route.  Regards Delainey 
 Great job - we all appreciate your management of the situation.  The A&A program is our most important asset.  Regards Delainey 
 Great job guys  - keep it coming!  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.  At the risk of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control. Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.  With the back and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.  Further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc.  A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.  Don't quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish some of these goals as well.  In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.  Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, the numbers are getting pretty large - we are trying to find a reasonable cut-off before this turns into an All-Employee meeting at the Hyatt.  John and I decided to cut it off based upon who will be wearing large visable budgets.  In the West, that includes Tim/Mike for trading; Chris/Greg for mid market and yourself for origination.  I hope this rationale will manage your issues.  If we invite Jake I think you do have to invite Parquet and McDonald and we just don't have the room.  Lets discuss. Regards Delainey 
 John, this is a Skilling issue - Charlene and myself are going to talk to him about several changes in the next couple of weeks.  Regards Delainey 
 Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the company we would be a $100 stock.  On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.  This process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.  I think radical change is not the answer.  The answer lies in a combination of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.  The goals of any restructuring are: a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the program; b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained; c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling and interviewing; d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly grounds the associate in the "Enron technology" which include skills in market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk; e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues; f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, retention and performance tool; g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, non-traditional sources of talent and h) increase cost effectiveness.  The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, people and teams, business tracks, etc.  I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.  I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with a strawman.  Let me know your thoughts.  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, thanks for the letter on Friday.  The team is preparing an analysis on where we have flexibility and preparing a response.  We should be able to respond before the end of the week.  Thanks Dave Delainey 
 David, i agree in principle with this process.  I assume that you and your team will implement.  Like we spoke about, I do not see a need to widely distribute this through the commercial organization.  I would just implement.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that we are reaching these goals.  Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we watch the funds flow issues.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please forward to Max Yzaguirre.  The e-mail failed.  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, please forward to Scott Josey, John C Thompson and Julie Murray.  I could not find them on e-mail.  Regards Delainey 
 I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.  Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following: a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately; b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better "fit" in the organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of action to rectify performance.  Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.  Other identified action items from the meetings include: a) the HR group will put together a "profile and performance book" for ENA's A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at the July 19th meeting; b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to continue rotating within ENA; c) ENA will be holding an additional "off-cycle" A&A super-saturday for Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area; and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.  Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.  Regards Mark and Dave 
 Guys the PRC has been moved to 11:00.  Regards Delainey 
 By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted.  We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline. Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing, our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.  Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.  We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a success.   Sincerely,   Dave 
 This is a reminder for you to please take a minute and select your reviewers for the PRC feedback.  Dave is also requesting that you provide a list of accomplishments for the past six (6) months.  Please provide this information to your direct reports as soon as possible.  Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call Kay  3-0643.   Thanks,  Kay      -

 MEETING CANCELLED FOR FRIDAY MAY 19, 2000   This is a reminder !!!!!  There will not be a Friday Meeting today, May 19, 2000.  Date:  Friday May 19, 2000  Time:  2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location: 30C1  Topic:   Combined Staff and Budget Meeting   If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643) or Bev (3-7857).  Thanks,  Kay 3-0643 
 Chris, Rob Milnthorp will give you a call to further discuss the opportunity.  I would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks to meet Rob in Calgary to speak in detail about the role, the market and expectations.  I appreciate your openess and let me know how I can help.  The Ontario market is one of the best new market opportunities for ENA over the next year.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as part of the new A&A program being rolled out by the ENE Office of the Chair, a new Associate and Analyst PRC is being set up.  I have nominated you as the six people from ENA to be on this PRC.  You will represent ENA's A&A's and participate in the evaluation and ranking across the entire company.  This is a very important function - please represent us well.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, lets discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you help Phillip out with this, I assume this has something to do with the 20/20 deal.  I believe a reserve should have been set up for this payment which was only designed to ensure that the transaction was accretive to NBPL.  Regards Delainey 
 Steve, great letter and arguement, I think the more public we can be on this one the better.  Thanks Dave 
 Gregg, please send a hard copy - the pdf file can not be opened on ENA systems in Houston.  Thanks Delainey 
 Jeff, as per our discussion, this would be a great opportunity for you to spend some time with and instill your vision for Enron to the leaders of the ENA organization.  I have attached a preliminary agenda which has you speaking to the group right after dinner the night of December 14th.  You have no time constraint on the length of your talk (ie) whatever you find find appropriate in order to get your message across.  I though it might be interesting for you to give your vision of Enron's 2001 goals, objectives and strategy.  As well, a brief business overview of EES, EBS and Networks may be valuable in building connections.    Regards Delainey 
 Please plan on attending and presenting.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, e-mail didn't pick up your name. You are invited as well.  Regards Delainey 
 Here you go.    Sorry, I have Enron Messaging working on it...But here you go for now..... 
 Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite. As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.  ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.  Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.    Regards Dave and John 
 Guys, updates to numbers given discussions at QBR's.    Regards Delainey 
 pls, forward these to Tammy Sheppherd to incorporate in the ENA OOC reports.  Regards Delainey 
 sound good mark thsx dave 
 Fran, can you speak to Brian on this issue.  Regards Delainey 
 David, thanks for the people listing.  Wes, we need 1999 and 2000 (including CE) ESA income statements for each market in as much detail as possible.   Looking for un-necessary overheads and where the income brightspots lie.  We would probably need the ESA 2001 budget (income, expense, cashflow and capital) for the trading/marketing/EES business and the asset/regulated business in seperate formats.  A current balance sheet would be helpful as well.  I think it may be appropriate for both of you to join us.  You need to get your Visa issues worked out quickly - Kay can help.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim,  what ever you think is appropriate.  As far as the weekend, lets just play it by ear.  At the meetings, I think it would be helpful to go through the following discussions/agenda: a) review the Brazilian and Argentine gas and power markets - flows, grid, participants (bids and offers), assets, pool structures, regulatory and political environment, currency and credit challenges, supply and demand & historical prices and volumes; b) review ESA's current regulated/un-regulated assets and generation strategy; c) review ESA current book positions, market views, products and product development; and d) brief review of other S. American markets.  I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and any one else you think appropriate.  Let me know what I need to do otherwise.  Thanks  Regards Delainey 
 Looks good.  Regards Delainey 
 D'Arcy, sorry I missed you last week. I am going to be down in Rio mid November for some meetings with the S American team. Maybe we can have a discussion then?  I would very much like to get your opinion.  Regards Delainey 
 Colleen, thanks for the update - as another part of the nat gas value chain, traded transportation, with and without EOL should be a priority.  However, I think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the FERC that will allow the market to work.  Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately.  Thanks.  Regards Delainey

South America is going home & they are off tomorrow ----Thank= s,=20 kay   On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio= n,=20 announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20 operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha= t=20 are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b= asic=20 organizational framework has been set.=20  As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new= =20 responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and= =20 Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting= =20 to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility= ;=20 however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20 commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus = will=20 be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal= l=20 country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE= O=20 of Elektro until its ultimate sale.  The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20 Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in= =20 Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark= =20 Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a= nd=20 Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our= =20 reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20 managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset= s=20 are pursued.  The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20 America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo= rk=20 business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20 commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu= e=20 products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and= =20 enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.  In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report = to=20 Joe and Orlando: =20 The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will= =20 focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine= =20 natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:  ? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services= =20 needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20 capabilities; ? Providing those products and services across South America and across the= =20 value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value= =20 opportunity; ? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move= =20 quickly to capitalize; ? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20 overall risk of the organization; ? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri= ca=20 consistent with this strategy, and ? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de= al=20 flow.  The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w= ho=20 work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,= =20 capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio= n,=20 finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20  The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The= =20 team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book= =20 for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale= s=20 efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel= y=20 trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible= =20 for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct= =20 reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ= as=20 risk activities.  The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20 Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we= =20 will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. = =20  The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati= on=20 that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20 functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea= m=20 and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20 Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20 units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as= =20 well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20 infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements= =20 in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.  These groups include:  The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20 manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as= =20 governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate= ,=20 in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20 functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20 assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th= is=20 interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator= y=20 function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20 Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.  The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t= he=20 interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20 current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi= ll=20 also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20 assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the= =20 Cuiaba project.  The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and= =20 John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal= =20 requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20 Wholesale Services - Legal Department.  Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20 Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil= l=20 report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial= =20 functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20 relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron= =20 Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale= =20 Services =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.  These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20 reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20 financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new=20 organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20 region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly=20 affected will be notified shortly. =20 Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20 businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we ar= e=20 uniquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20 shareholder value.=20

 No Meeting This Week   This is a reminder !!!!!  There will NOT be a Friday Meeting October 27, 2000.    Date:  October 27, 2000 Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Guys, attached you will find the updated orig plan for Q4.  Trading income is slim pickings so far ..... we need some key deals of all sizes to close in the fourth quarter from your organizations.  Thanks Delainey 
 Tim, that will be fine.  This is a discussion topic that I want your input on for next year.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, don't worry about me - it worked out fine.  Just a bad day on the P/L side.  Thanks for leading some of these efforts it is often a thankless job.  Regards Delainey 
 sounds like a great idea  delainey 
 Guys, I spoke with Mark this morning.  He is very supportive of the structure and idea.  I had indicated that he would continue to run the producer services business in the West but would also be part of the overall team as we plot out strategy in the West.  He wants to stay in Denver which I think we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into the overall team.  I had indicated that we would consolidate market making into Houston and Paul Lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or not - if so he needs to move to Houston.  Phillip/Barry, go ahead and start working with Mark as you develop your plans going forward.  I will be speaking to Stephanie Miller this week and will give the green light with her shortly.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I would start focusing some attention on gas at this point.  When we get together I would like to sit down and go through a number of organizational re-alignments and what we may want to do on the regulatory front to support those businesses.  Regards Delainey 
 fyi  Dave 
 Barry, I have not spoken to Whitt yet - working on this week.  I would suggest that you will need to get a few bright managers/associates to manage the mid-market and a couple of more experienced originators (internal or external?) to complement.  I would start thinking about how to get that done.  I would call Oxley for help if needed.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, lets get together in the next week or so to discuss progress.  In the meantime, what are we doing with regard to FERC 637 to ensure that we have favourable rules in the trading of natural gas transportation capacity?  Do we have a master summary of the RTO proposals submitted last week?  Regards Delainey 
 Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however, assuming a fixed amount of the "internal" legal costs are fairly represented by this allocation as ENA's "capacity" charge, you are correct.  This number will be in the P/L under your name.  The "outside" legal costs should be tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I need an estimate of the quarterly "capacity charge" for ENA and an estimate of outside legal costs by business unit.  Regards Delainey 
 David, can you point D'Arcy in the right direction in ENA or ESA.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, anything you can do to encourage your employees to take a little time to participate in the survey would be much appreciated.  This is a valuable exercise for the company.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, if you or any of you people have interest in attending please contact Wendy Roy.  Regards Delainey 
 fine 
 Strike One!  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, reference to a) below has to do with the legal budget.  Sorry for the lack of clarity.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, couple of points - a) please check spelling and typos closely and b) in the first paragraph of the second page starting "The Commercial Origination...." should end with ".... knowledge necessary to reach our goals."  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, hold off until I let you know to go.  Thanks dave 
 Guys, notes from the morning meeting.  Please review and comment.  Specific action items: a) i)further calculation of ENA/Non- ENA capacity charges, ii) estimation of outside legal and iii) formulation of charge out/feedback process to the business units; b) need budget/review for competitive analysis, technical and restructuring.     Regards Delainey 
 Barbara, short of me coming up with the money, it will be next to impossible to get this out of either the trading or origination group.  As a significant contributor to the PAC and Enron's other adventures, I don't have the room. Personally, I also have difficulty making campaign contributions so closely linked to specific legislation or policy.  This may not be the answer you want; however, I am all ears if you have any ideas on raising these funds.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, I would let this fish go.  He has been through the organization too many times.  Regards Delainey 
 Rodney, if this deal is such a long put why did you push me into this process?  You should have made the call to kill it.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find the final plan to meet our origination targets for Q4 consistent with our discussions.  It is important that we hit our numbers in order for Enron to meet its targets for the year.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, Joe Sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your capabilities better than ours.  In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass. General Hospital in Boston, part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric contract.  The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW of power.  I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP controls in the nation.  The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.  I spoke to him yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.  Joe is a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.  It may be a good lead into the health care segment.  Regards Delainey 
 Eric, as per my discussion with Rob, I believe that the site has the most value to us given its location and capability.  I would continue to actively develop that site for a variety of turbine technologies.  As far as the turbines, I would probably exit them in the most opportune manner.  Regards Delainey 
 REMINDER -----TODAY 3:00 PM   Dave would like to have a strategy meeting next Tuesday  October 17, 2000, from 3:00-5:00 pm in room 30C1. No preparation is necessary and it's important that each of you plan to attend.  If you cannot attend, please contact Dave directly.  Laura - Video Conf.  Frank Vickers - - Video Conf. Barry Tycholiz--  Video Conf. 
 Guys, what is your plan?  Regards Delainey 
 Mike, sorry for the delay..... lots going on including low value add in board meetings and PRC's.  Lets set up this discussion with the following points: a) we are not exiting Argentina; b) we need to right-size the overall organization to fit the business opportunity; c) if possible on the commercial front, I would like to consolidate intellectual assets to one location in order to generate greater productivity, increased team work, a flatter org chart, real time decision making and greater communication; d) we need to continue to maintain a strong presence (including customer coverage) in both markets including an office in Argentina; and e) I would like to consolidate all non-commercial activity for ESA to Sao Paulo.  Ultimately, I would like a very flat, commercially focused trading and origination organization (given limited resources) that prioritizes resources based on the highest value transactions independent of geography, retail vs wholesale or development vs commodity. However, I want to keep a strong presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that you guys will find the balance.  There is no need for you to leave Argentina - its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business model we are trying to move forward.  Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.  Please work with Joe and Orlando as part of this process.  Regards Delainey 
 Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern Gas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of this proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA point of view.  The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project. The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M. the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, venture capital and the "organizing group" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.  Regards Delainey 
 Rodney, from what you told me it sounds like GE is willing to play on the Selkirk asset so the sales cycle should be largely completed.  Can you answer Marty's other questions?  Regards Delainey 
 Marty, no agenda on this one at all.  Given, the change in Enron Industrial Markets towards building the paper and steel commodity markets and less so on the outsourcing product, I just wanted your opinion on whether this is a deal we should do especially given the sales cycle is largely completed.  I believe that Rodney and his team want to finish this deal but given other priorities they would like to transition the deal to EES.  Ultimately, the value (TCV, earnings, up-sell, resume) would benefit Enron more in EES than ENA.  Regards Delainey 
 Brian, what is the cost basis in these turbines?  Regards Delainey 
 Jana, I had a late request from the Portland team to nominate a person, I don't think that Janet would mind letting them nominate this person.  If I am incorrect Janet let me know.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I would like your opinion on this potential transaction.  This has been sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter or so.  Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some value for Enron to take this deal including: a) $200 M in TCV for 2000; b) $3 to $5 M in value; c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the large industrial customers; and d) provides an "in" to the GE family of companies which could result in significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick, I have signed the DASH. Good job.  One comment, the DASH for Basic particularily the RAC comments was very poorly written.  Please keep an eye on this for me.  Regards Delainey 
 John, I don't get it - are they trading gas and power.   I thought this was= =20 your group?  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, please provide Jana with your choice of person ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, do you have a home for this guy - he desperately wants to stay in S. America.  Regards Delainey 
 Tim, it is all yours please communicate ASAP to Jana Jovanni in the A&A program.  Regards Delainey 
 This is a reminder that your QBR has been scheduled for  Monday October 23, 2000.    Date:  Monday October 23, 2000  Time:  9:00 - 11:00am  Location 3321  Topic:  QBR    If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.   Thanks,  Kay 
 This is a reminder that your QBR has been scheduled for  Monday October 23, 2000, in conf room 3321. Please be prepared to discussed:  A) QBR l.  Portfolio Review-Raptor/Non Raptor   B) 2001 Business Plan    If you have any questions/conflicts, please feel to contact me at 853-0643.   Thanks,  Kay 
 Guys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $100M in nominal value): a) 2 power barges - Brian - $13M b) 2 ABB 11N1 - Rob- $35M c) 1 501D5A - Janet/Chris - $25M d) 1 7EA - Janet/Chris- $20M  All other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects. Could you please provide me your plan with these units.  I would like to flatten out our book (ie) ensure there are good homes for or divest of all our existing turbines before we look at purchasing additional units for 2002.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, what is the status of this turbine - would we be able to turn it back in exchange for foregoing on the ld's?  Or do we want this turbine?  Regards Delainey 
 David, do we need to "volunteer" people to participate?  Do we want a more structured process?  Regards Delainey 
 fyi 
 FYI 
 Guys, what is this!!!!  No - I think that Ahlstrom should take this risk or it should be reflected in a price reduction. I vote not to do the deal otherwise.  Regards Delainey 
 Please mark on your calendars to attend given current discussions about the gas organization.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, please mark your calendars for the 2000 ENA Management Offsite scheduled for December 14th and 15th at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  We envision people flying in the afternoon/evening of December 13th with the offsite being held on December 14th and 15th.  Departure would occur the morning of December 16th.  It is important that everyone stays for the entire period including Friday night.  Jeff Skilling and Greg Whalley have taken time out their schedule to speak to us on Thursday and Friday night about Enron Corps strategy and our eCommerce/Networks strategy respectively.  A complete agenda will follow shortly.  Dorie Hitchcock will manage all the logistics.  Regards Delainey 
 Dick, you are doing the right things - if you run into timing issues in the future do not hesitate to give me a call directly.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I'm not picking on you - I just can't believe legal and corporate let this go through. Sorry.  By the way, Redmond will take responsibility for the Pan Nat arbitration as per our discussion.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, do you have a deal book -explaining the overall transaction, returns and risk?  This will help me facilitate the process.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, I completely disagree with legals position.  I have difficulty with some of our VP's having signing authority.  I believe this is a significant control issue.  Mark, is this widespread in ENA?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the Hot List for each business unit.  The performance of your group is key to making our targets for Q4 and to meet budgeted origination performance for the year.  Independent of specific budgets for the groups, the origination organization needs to generate $250M for Q4.  Ultimately, a strong performance in Q4 by the origination organization will help build momentum into the year-end PRC.  I will be setting up time with each of you to go through your numbers and specifics on the deals.    Regards Delainey 
 sure, just set up with kay  thxs dave 
 Eric, like the United Way, our goal should be 100%participation.  In order to reach that goal, we need the reporting mechanisms to determine which groups and managers have very low participation rates.  I strongly believe that ENA's numbers would be better if we had north of 80% participation (ie) the "unhappy" folks are more likely to input info than the "happy" folks.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, hopefully we can convince you to come when we re-schedule - seemed like an easy call.  Regards Delainey 
 Janet, he can approve but can't sign as a director. You need to continue to manage. This would take a board resolution to change (ie) he can not bind the company as a director.  Regards Delainey 
 Please be sure your are in attendance or let me know if you can't attend so that I can make Dave aware.  This is a reminder !!!!!  There will be a Friday Meeting October 13, 2000.    Date:  October 13, 2000 Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Rick, I have been having discussions with both Joe Deffner and Jean Mrha on this one.  Clearly, this is a commercial banking product in which we have little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or collateral (reserve risk).  Ultimately, I have challenged the Upstream Group to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness.  Regards Delainey 
 Dave would like to have a strategy meeting next Tuesday  Ocotober 10, 2000 from 2:30-4:30 in room 30C1. No preparation is necessary and it's important that each of you plan to attend. If you cannot attend, please contact Dave directly.   Thanks! 
 Ike, is the president and CEO of TVA.  FYI  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, given our schedules, it appears that e-mail may be the most effective communication tool.  I thought I would just follow up on progress being made in TVA on our settlement process.  As well, I understand that there has been a number of communications between TVA and Enron on the NoxTech emissions business.  I have encouraged the Enron folks to pursue this opportunity with TVA given the larger dialogue.  The Enron team has told me that TVA  wishes to move to firm pricing and a MOU on this technology.  Given the larger dialogue, I have suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both TVA and Enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are going.  Please give me a call at your earliest convenience.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 Jeff, can you speak briefly with Kevin on this one - intriguing idea if the execution was probable.  By the way, what is our plan with Sithe?  Regards Delainey 
 Rick which meeting are you refering to?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, it will be very difficult to get money out of the power group - is the expectation that I come up with the dollars - just curious.  Are we not circumventing the spirit of the political contribution rules?  Regards Delainey 
 I am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting.  I just think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with families.  The drive to Galveston and back - the overnight babysitter - the potential trouble that may result in close quarters and hours of drinking et al.  I prefer the original idea at Enron Field.  Regards Delainey 
 Kevin, how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company?  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas and power business.  Rather, my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and generate deal flow.  As well, to reduce the conflict between the trading and origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the market than focused on internal issues.  As far as specifics, you will have to wait and see.  Thanks Delainey 
 Chris, you are officially the king today!  With the PSCo deal this effectively eliminates the LM position assuming we successfully sell LV.  Regards Delainey 
 Oz, David is interested in the fuel cell business, do you need his skill set?  Regards Delainey 
 Erin, don't want to keep passing the ball;however, this is a retail opportunity in almost all states (ie) railroad demand is classified as retail customers under most IOU tariffs.  I would ask Harold Buchanan  Regards Delainey 
 Sounds reasonable. 
 Charlene, the 2nd is ok. Either Mark, myself or John should probably be able to do the 28th as well.  Obviously, we strongly believe in the benefit of the program and its goals - ultimately, we  have to walk the talk! Regards Delainey 
 Charlene, that will be fine... on a different note, where are you on the straw man we spoke about.  Ultimately, I would like to continue to push this with the leadership team.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, can you forward your parts.  Regards Delainey 
 Rob, no hi or goodbye - you are losing your Canadian politeness :)  On a serious note, you are doing the right thing for the company and for Barry's career.  This will be a good opportuntity for him to get to the next level if he makes it happen.  As you are aware, I will aggressively support you and the Toronto iniative. Let me know.  Regards Delainey 
 Updated draft memo.    Regards Delainey 
 Joe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play given the owners.  Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the customer?  Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility? Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated structure in the RFP?  Is this a play that you would support?  On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?  It is important for us to be able to quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.  How is it going otherwise?  Regards Delainey 
 Marion, the leads include Heather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan in the Eastern Origination Group and Michael L Miller in the Principal Investing Group.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical feedstocks into industrial gases.  He wants to establish the technology in Baytown and is looking for our assistance and capital.  This is probably a stretch but it may be worthwhile for you to speak with him.  I am not advocating this play just passing on the message.  Steve Paras 718-630-5611  He will be in Houston on Friday.  Regards Delainey 
 Mary, none outside of Enron plans.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, this sounds like an ambush..... :) 
 Guys, assuming that we receive $7M for the 6B's what is our cost basis in the Barges?  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I am not sure that this will attract the people we want to hear the message; however, I will hold back judgement until we discuss the strategy in more detail.  Regards Delainey 
 Rick, I disagree - the DASH had an implication unsubstantiated that the current deal on the table is a bad one.  I believe that RAC should provide a clear opinion or say directly that the analysis is deficient.  It is too easy to state the obvious.  Regards Delainey 
 David, you may be getting to the nub here.  Ultimately, this is a lot more art than science.  It will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision rule to manage this process.  I am looking to the opinions of yourself, Ray, Dick and Jeff, given the facts in each case, does this appear to be a good trade given the market, the specifics of the company, the carrying costs of the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return assets (ROCE >25%).  This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that comes from this group.  As a result, I need to have a positve consensus from this group in each case.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?  My understanding is that we have a done deal on the 6B's.  Is this correct?  I may be a nervous nellie but I would like to put all this stuff behind us (ie) no more 6B's or barges.  Regards Delainey 
 Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.  Regards Dave and John 
 David, I have a problem with the RAC comments made on page #2 of the DASH. Specifically, the two paragraphs basically add no value and just confuse the reader (ie) what is your opinion?  Is this a good sale or can significant recovery (on a risk adjusted basis) occur if we convert the sub debt and infuse more equity?  Are we not receiving enough value from the CFPC given the possible recovery of this sector?  The DASH is deficient in its view of Basic's prospects given current energy prices.  Jeff/Dick/Ray, what are your opinions?  Independent of the desire to move on - what is the right call - I do not want to give value away in any divestiture or restructuring.  Regards Delainey 
 Jeff, I think we should take a quick review of the existing PI portfolio to see where we are and where we want to go - we have with the completion of FCEL made a tremedous amount of investment in a very short period of time >$60 to $80M.  I would like to  hear how we are moving to monetize more mature investments and influence/generate value from the earlier stage investments.  I don't want to approve any further investments until we have had such a discussion.  Regards Delainey 
 Ike, it is unfortunate we could not make this work yesterday; but I understand your position.  In the interest of facilitating continuing dialogue and perhaps giving you our view on how we analyze such positions, I will send you our document.  I would suggest that we try to set up a follow up meeting in early October once you have completed your work.  Regards Dave Delainey 
 This is a reminder !!!!!  There will be a Friday Meeting September 29th, 2000.    Date:  September 29, 2000 Friday  Time:   2:30 pm - 4:30 pm  Location:  30C1  Topic:   ENA Management Committee     If you have any questions or conflicts, please feel free to call me (3-0643).  Thanks,   Kay 3-0643 
 Guys, can you give me an update on what this deal is about - e-mail would be fine?  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, how are the business units doing on the "talent pipeline" since we have put this on auto-pilot?  Is HR still providing resumes?  Regards Delainey 
 Bruce, obviously ENA does not have a problem with this.  Regards Delainey 
 Chris, this sounds good.  It would be helpful for us (the overall power business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.  I think we all believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and rewarded.  Key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions and origination; and d) EOL customer sign-ons and deal flow.  I look forward to sitting down to discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 John, completely agree with your view - David, I would have the matrix, with all of the ENA statistics and names, ready for distribution on Friday to the key managers to try and illicit a response from the low participation folks.  Regards Delainey 
 ok with me 
 Guys, please take a read of the draft memo - would like to send out tommorrow.    Regards Delainey 
 John, I think you may want to be part of this.  Regards Delainey 
 Paul, I had a look at the pitch and I thought it was an intriguing idea.  I think it works welll in allocating resources between competing "going concerns" but may be more difficult to allocate people to new  businesses that may not have the income to fund the best talent.  I also wonder if the cost of creating, managing and maintaining a market like this is greater than the overall benefit achieved over the existing system.  In its own often clumbsy looking way Enron's culture does allocate capital and people fairly effectively.  Obviously, these are very cursory remarks - I have not spent a great deal of time on this.  Regards Delainey 
 Thanks 
 Chris, as per our discussion, I just want to confirm that we have the ability to break the contract with the EPC provider at any time.  Further, I want to confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the short run value of the project.  In other works, we have no intention of lifting their offer.  Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines.  These guys add no value and they are killing me!  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position in some detail.  In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA could create significant value from a project that we have very little invested.  I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone and we have no intention of lifting their offer. As far as EECC involvement, as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.  I will argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant dollars or taking significant risks.  Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.  Regards Delainey 
 Krista , you are very welcome - best of luck in the future.  Regards Delainey 
 Jim, I have forwarded your binder to David Oxley to set up a meeting for the wholesale group to discuss appropriate homes for your people.  It has taken a little longer than expected to get people together but we are making progress.  It may be helpful for you to identify, like Abe, where these folks would like to go if they had their druthers.  It may be worthwhile for us to have a quick phone call to discuss.  Regards Delainey 
 Ok - you got the ball.  Regards Delainey 
 Joe, part of this deal is repayment of the sub debt at par and a series of cashflows that we would probably like to monetize.  Have you looked at this?  Jeff, I would like to get your view on the economics - basically they are giving us 89% of our carry value in cash and 11% of our carry value in a contingent payment payable at restructuring or sale of their partnership. Lets discuss ASAP.  Regards Delainey 
 good job - keep them coming!  Regards Delainey 
 Kay, can you set up a dinner with Randall.  Thanks 
 Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on Wednesday.  Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so that we can ensure that we are comparing "apples to apples".  I would also suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers. It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties settlement offer.  I am in the office over the next several days. Lets discuss at your earliest convenience.    Regards Dave Delainey 
 Christi, I was unable to open the file can you please send a hard copy.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits: a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues they are having with GE and b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission correlating into increased operating hours.  I need two things to determine if we want to move forward: a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?  I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.  Regards Delainey 
 Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology. Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value or multiple value based on 90 degree output.  I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.  The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.  My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.  Regards Delainey 
 Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real knowledge of the potential deal.  Likely this originates at the local level and is probably a long put.  Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more detail over the next week.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, as usual the investment is subject to RAC review and a DASH.  Regards Delainey 
 Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward under the structure we have discussed.  FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that vest based upon 60MW of orders; - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that call; - the transaction is fully press released immediately.  CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW; - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.  I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.  Thanks Delainey 
 Guys, HR should be in touch with you with regard to a couple of people that I have agreed to take from CALME:  Donahue  - Maria Elena Garcia - Director; Duran   - Boris Feschiev - Manager; - Mark Provenzano - Manager.  Regards Delainey 
 ok
