 Ben  You want to go get lunch ? 
 Hi Kristi  Hope things are going well. I got your email address from Andrea, who also told me you'd moved to Pittsburgh.  Enron implosion is in full progress and I think this week, we will be left with 30% of our original size.  On the gas power and trading, there are numerous groups who are trying to work out other opportunities, but we will have to wait and see.  Keep me posted on what you are upto.    Harry 
 Thanks Andrea 
 Jeanie  I have a couple of questions of you, when you get a chance, can you give me a call.  Nothing significant, call me when you get a chance.  Harry

 Max  I am glad you liked the presentation.  I had a look at the tool-kit - I think it is a good brief description of various products.  I did forward your email to Iris Mack and she might be able to provide you further input on that. She is also available as a resource (as a derivatives specialist) to analyze clients risk and provide solutions.  I would be more than happy to discuss any specific client situations you have and what we could offer to them. Would be happy to sit down and discuss more stuff with you if you are interested.   Harry 
 Sure. That should be fun. Anything we can bring ?   Harry 
 Stacey  What is this dual trigger option - can you give me some background on this one ?   Harry 
 Sure 
  Lets work with these curves. Ignore my comments in the fourth column.   Harry 
 Am on my way. See ya in a few.  Harry 
 I left a message for Greg, that we'd be prepared to show a 3$ bid if that includes capacity.  I did underline the point that we are not too excited to buy but nevertheless will show an indicative bid.  Let me know if you have any questions.   Harry 
 TJae  Can you mark me down for a half day (sick day) for today. Was feeling terri= ble this morning.   Harry 
 Cathy  Tried calling you earlier today but looks like there is something wrong with your phone (x34049).  Unfortunately I will not be able to make it tomorrow , but my colleague Doug Smith (3-9310) who runs our Ercot trading group has agreed to take my spot.  I told him this was for 2 hours. Can you give me a call and let him know the details. I did give Doug my folder.   Thanks   Harry 
 wow 
 Congrats Jeff  I dont think there could be anyone better and more capable  to take this challenging position. Good luck.   Harry

 Frank  I was on vacation last week. Feel free to stop by anytime. Would be happy to be of any help.   Harry 
 Iris  what is the difference between this spark spread function call and the one = being used in the spreadsheets we use ?   Harry 
 Greg   VOM - I think we did $2, Brandon should be able to confirm, I know it was 7x24, with 8 hour min run Re size - our interest is atmost 250 MW  Capacity in the ECAR market is important from a reliability aspect.  For example we could sell totally synthetic tolls and they would not be as valuable as the toll  off a plant in the region. Thats where the capacity comes into play. Moreover as RTOs come in, there might be an explicit ICAP market for ECAR.    Harry 
 Warren   I spoke to Pushkar Shahi and he would be happy to chat with you. His number is 713-853-9199. He trades lots of bonds, notes and eurodollars.   Harry 
 Mason  Did Rob make a price on the ANP. If not can we finalilze a price on this toll and give John Llodra a call.  Harry 
 We got to check this one out - see how it works.   Harry 
 Hi Darren   You sure did.  The whole thing going around here just convinces me how the basic economics and business ideas work as they should.  They all loved us for nearly four years - we could not do anything wrong and now they hate everything about us. The investors and the street is silly and stupid.  While one should spend time looking for the next Microsoft, one should spend time looking for the next Enron.  As for the future,  I am neutral - we have a fair chance of pulling it through, though there are significant risks. If our strength is the intellectual captial - the traders and marketeres (you never hear the term franchise) - why would they hang out here for too long, the only thing holding them here is availability of capital and the tolerance of that capital to take risk.  Once the capital is gone, its hard to see the traders and deal makers stay.  In the end, its  hard to say we will survive to be the biggest and baddest commodity trading house but we sure did pioneer it.   Harry 
 Karen   Since I will be interviewing on Thursday, I'd like to have Rob Stalford, in my group (he is the option trader) to interview for the Associate / Analyst program on Saturday. Does that work ? Rob is a manager. Could
