 Hi Kristi  Hope things are going well. I got your email address from Andrea, who also told me you'd moved to Pittsburgh.  Enron implosion is in full progress and I think this week, we will be left with 30% of our original size.  On the gas power and trading, there are numerous groups who are trying to work out other opportunities, but we will have to wait and see.  Keep me posted on what you are upto.    Harry 
 Thanks Andrea 
 Jeanie  I have a couple of questions of you, when you get a chance, can you give me a call.  Nothing significant, call me when you get a chance.  Harry

 Max  I am glad you liked the presentation.  I had a look at the tool-kit - I think it is a good brief description of various products.  I did forward your email to Iris Mack and she might be able to provide you further input on that. She is also available as a resource (as a derivatives specialist) to analyze clients risk and provide solutions.  I would be more than happy to discuss any specific client situations you have and what we could offer to them. Would be happy to sit down and discuss more stuff with you if you are interested.

 Stacey  What is this dual trigger option - can you give me some background on this one ?   Harry
