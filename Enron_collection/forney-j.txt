 Hello,  George. 1.   The actual shift change occurs at 6 am until further,  however,  I expect traders to arrive at least 20 minutes before shift change. 2  the September work schedule is attached 3.  I understand that most park in daily fee, "outside" lots.   Thanks, JMF 
  Kim, I had mentioned that I had not completed submitting my expense for temporary housing,  etc.    I mistakenly thought that the deadline was one year. Can I still get this in?   I think I have everything in order.  Thanks, JMF 
 Any luck with the changes we have requested? JMF 
 kim, thanks so much for checking into this for me.   sorry for the delay in submitting.  JMF 
 So,  you waited until the weather became bearable before coming to Houston?   Good call there. I travelled to Portland a week ago to visit friends.    Deb and I had a great time and the flight was so cheap,  $165.       The weather was awesome and the wine was good (  as far as I can remember ). Anyway,  it was good to see Stewie, Tim and even Richter.  What are you working on here,  is it classified?  JMF 
 yep,  coffee is a good idea.  jmf 
  Hey,  melon-boy -  Who would I talk to about the residential customers.    I received a call from a load aggregating company that specializes in residential sign ups. This sounds like a good idea, provided that our strategy hasnt changed.  Whatup?  JMF 
 What about New Power,  should we refer this deal to them?   It looks pretty good.  fornicatio 
  Joe, Do you have any record of this deal?   I should that you worked this day. If this exists in your personal trade log,  then we need to Enpower this.  Let me know what you find. 
  Alex, Could you check your trade log for this?   I show that you were on this day.    If this trade is good,  we need to Enpower. Let me know what you find.  JMF 
  Joe, Here's another.   Please check this out and let me know what's going on.  Thanks, JMF 
   Boy:  the deal number for the coa option for tomorrow is 765595.1.  do you need this????   JMF 
   Due to Oklaunion being down  for maintenance,    we are being cut again on offpeak schedule #570719.     This 25 mw purchase from Tenaska needs to be replaced for hour ending 23 and 24 today.     Buy the power tonight  and enter deal under Ercot Mgmt book, as this is Doug's power. I have already made the cuts in Enpower for both hours ending 23,24 and tomorrow.  For tomorrow,  I have purchased energy for this schedule,  so we dont have to worry about it on a real time basis.  If you have questions,  let me know.  Thanks, JMF 
   Alex, You have been somehow  entering deals under South America - Brazil region,   rather than South 2001.   Risk has been having a problem with this. This has also affected the Brazil trading desk. Double check your deal entry desks and zones.     I intended to mention this last week and I forgot.   It came up again today,  per risk.  Also, on the hour ending 6 deal today;   you should have entered a sale to Frontera in Enpower, rather than Mirant. This is a bit confusing,  but here goes:  Frontera had sold Mirant this option,  not Enron.     Frontera tells me daily what Mirant is calling for.   I replace this power,  or Frontera generates the schedule. If I (or you)  replace,  then we do enter a schedule of a sale to Mirant in the Portal.   But,  we dont sell to Mirant in Enpower, as this is not our deal.  Instead,   the sale goes to Frontera.   They pay us to reimburse us for buying LCRA on their behalf.  Does that help?  JMF 
 Kim, Cammi Mursch has asked for an e-mail from Enron authorizing an extension. Can we do this?  Thanks, JMF 
  Linus, can you give me the info for a New Power contact?  jmf 
   Anoush, I have talked with John Phillips with Cinergy Worldwide.    His company is an experienced residential load aggregator in the Northeast.  They are not related to the Cinergy utility.      They are interested in a partnership with Enron/New Power where Cinergy would market directly to individuals using our paper/ terms in return for a negotiated fee. He is interested in entering the Texas Choice arena.     They claim to be capable of size in signups.  I thought that this may be a good fit for NewP. The number for  John Phillips is :   410-365-5613   Let me know what your thoughts are.   John Forney Ercot Trading 853-7160 
   The Oklaunion plant is offline until midnight Friday.    I have replaced the power for this deal in the cash market. No replacement is needed. Also; You will notice that from peak on through 24, the pool has been strong.     Generators are taking their units offline for offpeak and are running short until peak the next day. You can recognize this in the ACE display on the monitor.   Notice hour ending 3,4,5.   Theyre draggin. Prices still havent done much in the offpeak,even with this going on.  JMF 
   Mr. Hinson, Sorry I missed your call.      The Frontera Plant is composed of 2 CT's and and steamer.      Three units in total,  however,   the steamer cannot operate independently of the ct's.    I say this because the Ercot protocols allow dispatching each of these units independently and Ercot exercises this right while punishing us financially for non compliance.  There is no way under the Resource Plan from the protocols to express which combinations must be considered.       These units are behind a common point,  so the rules as they were written dont consider us.  I know that this is more than you asked for,  but for whatever it's worth........   Thanks and give me a call if you need more info,  JForney Enron Ercot Region 
   Hourly Ercot is long 65 mw's for hour ending 6.    We have this routed to North Zone load.   If prices appear to be heading negative,  then export or sell outright.  Please review all positions in the system for tomorrow so that you can transact if necessary.  Thanks, JMF 
 Kim, Here is the e-mail address for Cammi.  Thanks, JMF 
   Madhup, We have been having alot of trouble with one of the big screens that is fed by the portal server.      It is the display over Doug's head.    This shows ACE and load forecast.  Doug is very excited about this,  as we have had a daily problem   It works temporarily ,  but goes down daily.  Is Sasha the guy to talk to on this?  JMF 
 best wishes to you and your daughter. jmf 
  The updated help desk numbers for 24 hour call are as follows:  phone - 713-553-3758 page - 713-327-4523  These have changed, so update your phone list accordingly.   Thanks,  JMF 
  The Hourly Ercot book is long 30 mw's  at $13.25 for hour ending 23 and 24 on Friday.    This is currently scheduled into the North Zone load. When you sell this,   cut the load and replace with the appropriate QSE trade.  The purchase is in Enpower as #825387.  The sale to Ercot Imbal is under #825406.        Cut the enpower sale and replace with appropiate sale counterparty. Everything should be entered under the Hourly Ercot desk.  Let me know how it goes.  JMF 
 Adrianne, I was not able to participate in a phone screen for any of the applicants below,  due to business travel. What is the latest on this? JMForney 
  Tom, The Frontera file has, in the first tab,   their calculation for their daily costing. Ken gave me this and asked me what I think.    It would probably be best if we talk some more about it,  rather than sending it to Jerry Brown,  etc.  What do you think?  JMF 
   The ST ercot book is long 30 mw's in the offpeak hours for Monday.    We would like to sell these mw's at a reasonable price that is left to your judgement. If prices look to be potentially negative,  of course,  sell the mw's.  Give me a call if you have questions, preferrably before 10 pm.   Thanks, JMF 
 Give me a call  jmf 
 The Resolution desk has given me the password.   However,  George was not set up in deal blotter under North America,  East Region.   I have since submitted another E-request for George.   The reason is,   he cannot log onto blotter or create deals under his name. Can you watch out for this?  JMF 
 What again is the $ impact and the days involved that we are discussing. 
 William,   things look better  but,    George does not have access to the EPMI Hourly Ercot book.       This is the book that he trades primarily. He also needs EPMI Ercot Asset.  Thanks, JMF 
   Frontera will be running short for the schedule listed below.      I have sold them this imbalance for $28.57.    Any imbalance charges billed to them should be allocated to me listed on the schedule below.  hour ending 7 - 320 he 8 -320 he 9 - 320 he 10 - 215 he 11 - 150 he 12 - 50  The total is 1375.   This is the equivalent of a financial swap,  but the settlement will remain intact.  Thanks, JMF 
  Ken, Take a look at this.   We will sell an additional 85mw's for hour ending 2300 tomorrow.    This is not on the sheet, obviously.  Thanks, JMF 
   Frontera has scheduled the following for tomorrow:  he 7-11,   350 mw's he 12-22,  400 mw's he 23, 50 mw's   We will be required to sell an additional 85 mw's tomorrow for hour ending 23 in order to get up to the minimum run of 135mw's. If Frontera has problems coming up tomorrow,  there may be an ACE issue.  We will advise.  JMF 
   I have sold Frontera a financial swap for $28.50 for hours ending 7-12.    The first 3 hours are for size (300 mw's). I would buy hours 7-9 tomorrow for up to $20.      I could buy up to the 300 mw's.     Schedule this to load in the North. I could also use 200 mw's for he 10 and 150 mw's for he 11.  Calpine has had an offer recently for hours ending 7-9.  If you have questions,  please give me a call,  as this is a very important issue.  Words of advice:  Dont go into the market with a $20 bid for 300 mw's.   Quietly accumulate these mw's if possible.     Do not tip your hand on this deal,  as that would contribute to spiking RT prices.  Thanks, JMF 
 Karen, I have spoken with Adrianne yesterday concerning the status of this process.    At that time,   I had left messages with all three candidates,  but was unable to reach them. Late yesterday afternoon,  I received a call from Nicholas Watson. I was impressed with his previous experience in trading and his educational background.    He also had shown some innovation related to some projects that he worked on at JP Morgan Chase & Co.  I would recommend scheduling Nicholas for an interview.   I did relay to him that we would contact him within a week.  I will again call the other candidates.  JMF 
   John, The outage requested for Friday has been approved by Kevin Presto.      I am glad to hear that the demin tank situation has been resolved. The meeting that I attended was helpful in understanding your level of frustration.  If you have further questions,  please let me know.  John Forney 
  Greetings:  For tonight,   Frontera is long 85mw's hour ending 2300.    We need to sell this under the Teco Services book.   For tomorrow Frontera needs to sell:  hour ending  4 - 30 mw's hour ending 5 -30 mw's Enter a purchase from Frontera (Teco services book) enter the same price as you sold for. Enter the sale (Teco Services).  I am also selling Frontera 200 mw's for hour ending 7 and 50 mw's hour ending 8. I am selling this position for $26.04.       I will be short the Imbalance price during this time. If you can buy below $26.04 for this time period,  do so and schedule to load  in the South.  I am long into the North Zone as follows : he 1-6,    40 mw's he 23&24,   55mw's  I am long under deal #834600 If prices appear to weaken,  sell these mw's for 1-6 and cut this Ercot Imbalance deal by same.    This deals should be listed under Ercot Asset.   Thanks, JMF 
   I have sold Frontera the following:  he 7 - 200 mw for $26.04 he 8 - 50 mw for $26.04   Please transfer this imbalance amount to me.    See deal no's   835119 & 835120.   Thanks, JMF 
  TJ: Can we create an inbox folder for Joe?   I need to leave something for him tonight and I promised that it would be in his inbox (which he doesnt have)  Thanks,  JMF 
 Yes, I would like that very much.   Please give me a call at 3-7160 JMF 
   I have spoken with Ruben this morning.    He is currently working in Structuring for Sempra,  focusing on the Ercot retail market.    Additionally,  he has worked for the California PX.    This and his educational background would have me recommend scheduling an interview with this applicant.   JFORNEY 
 thanks,   tell these guys to trade it up! 
    http://mospublic.ercot.com/ercot/jsp/balancing_services_mcp.jsp   This is the public Ercot ISO site.    You can query for prices.    We have an internal site,  the East Power Portal site,  which has a section for Price and Load. This scrapes info from the Ercot website.   I would think that you need special access to use the link below.   http://eastpower.test.corp.enron.com/portal/basic_page.aspx?mod=35&url=/portal/modules/regions/ercot/priceload.aspx   JMF 
 A reminder,   I am 55 mws long for hours 23 & 24 today.   This has been scheduled into the North Zone.    If you sell make sure that you cut the Enpower deal and make the appropriate entries in the Portal.   Enpwr deal   834600   is the sale to North Zone.   The Ercot Asset desk is long 5 mw's  for the offpeak hours at $9.20.   The  Enpwr deal number is #836534 If you sell hours 1-6,  cut this sale to Ercot Imbal and replace with the appropriate counterparty under Hourly Ercot book.    We will leave   Additionally,   Frontera needs to sell the following:  hour ending 4 - 30 mw's he 5 - 30 mws he 6 - 85 mw's Put these purchases/ sales in the Teco Services book.  I have sold them the power swap where I sell them 100 mw for 7&8 ($25).    I then pay the pool price.    If prices somehow appear that they will be greater than $25 for these hours,  please cover and schedule to the South Zone    The Swap went very well today,  since we had a physical position:  Although the physical may lose $1500,  the financial swap will make $17,000.  Here's how it works: When you buy balday,   you buy fixed ($30) and sell floating (Ercot Pool) Today I sold fixed ( $37) and bought floating.  The floating components cancel and we are left with a $7 margin.   Call if you have questions. JMF 
 i have zeroed this price out.   thanks  jmf 
   Save the file attached below to your desktop.    You can just click and drag.  You can view the data by interval or by hourly average.     Make sure that the dates are in the following: 10/25/01 10/26/01  To view today (10/25) make sure the ending date is tomorrow to pull in he 2400.   The purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks,  ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.   I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool. I used a similar tool in the California pool.    For example,  take yesterday and compare to today, same period.   Factor in weather,  unit outages, etc.  This should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.  Let me know your feedback.  JMF 
 I am discussing this with Cara at Tenaska.   She is going to send more support for this. JMF 
   Sell hour ending 6 only- 30 mw's for Frontera tomorrow.   DO NOT GO TO THE POOL . If you cannot sell the mw's for a reasonable price ($0 or greater) and the pool appears to be going to a negative,   call Jerry and wake him up.   Have him ramp up starting he 7. Try to sell tonite if possible,  so we wont have to wake them up.  I have sold the swap to Frontera for tomorrow.  They will be short the following hours:  he 7 - 370 he 8 - 265 he 9 - 200 he 10 - 50  I have sold the swap to them at $24.50.   I sell fixed and buy floating.       If you think that the pool will be high,  then you buy fixed and take to the pool. You will buy fixed and sell floating.    Net,  we are left with two fixed prices.  Very cool.  Ercot will be calling due to the ACE issue.   The plant will be coming up slowly.  Call if you have questions,  JMF 
   Frontera is scheduled to generate a total of 400 mw's onpeak.    There may be an ace issue for hours ending 7-10.   We suspect that Ercot will want us to stay down due to price/lack of load. Check with Real Time trader.  Thanks,.  JForney 
 Please note that when we will receive a unit specific instruction,   we will also receive a category one deployment. The unit specific instruction tells us the level that they want the unit to produce.    The category one is just a summary of how much we need to move to achieve the unit specific level.   These should not be combined .  Also,  when you receive a category 2, 3 or 4 we are essentially receiving an OOM type instruction that is settled under the OOM provisions.  JMF 
 Yes,  Joe Capasso does report to me.  Thanks, JMF 
   Thanks for the info for the additional load.      As I understand it,  we now have approximately 20 mw's in the South.  This is great!! Each day I review balancing energy prices vs.  daily prices and the choice is extremely simple:    We allow the pool to fill this load.  I would recommend against buying any hedges against this power until further.     There is a good chance that prices occasionally go negative for offpeak/weekends and we want to take full advantage.  Do we need to discuss this further?   I just want to be on the same page. Let me know what you think.  JMF 
 I will be attending a funeral tomorrow,  but I am available to meet on Tuesday.    Thank you for checking back with me.  JMF 
 it's a power thang.....  JMF 
 Kim, I need to speak with you at your earliest convenience.    Please call me at 3-7160.   Thanks, JMF 
 Jim Flores - did he also work in Finance?   I dont remember him...  JMF 
 Stewie, How is it going with baby Wolf?   I want to make sure everything is ok before I call him.        Done any good deals lately? At least tell me about hiking.  JMF 
 Thanks for handling this!  JMF 
   Jerry,  please see the attached:  JMF 
 I have relocated from the West Desk in Portland Oregon and have been advised by our Legal Dept.   that I should not delete any e-mails until further notice.  Please advise.  JMForney 
 Kim, I'm sorry I did not get to come to your open house.    I got the message on the day of the party and I forgot to RSVP that I couldnt attend. I am a jackass,  but you knew that already...................... Hope all went well.    How's the new job?  JMF 
 Frank, I am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities.     Although you mentioned that  the $1,800  (the amount in my account) is a small sum,  I have been reluctant to invest more money with your firm,   given to performance of the suggestions provided previously. I have been a market maker in the electricity business and I realize that no one is right all of the time;    I dont expect this.      However,   I do expect some consistent contact from a broker  who has been successful in his own trading, not just success in brokering trades.      My view will be that the more success we have,  the more money I will be willing to invest.  I am interested in discussing my specific financial situation with you  and learning more about you, your track record and your abilities. I do wish to talk about covered calls on specific options that I have expiring in January.    I would also like to discuss any other profitable ideas that fit my profile.  I will not use your suggestions to trade at  discount brokerage or otherwise abuse our potential relationship.   I look forward to hearing from you.  John M Forney 713-853-7160 
 Thanks for listening  on last week's phone call.       I have been asked to help Doug Gilbert-Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned.     If you have not  heard,   the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets.        This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these  respective regions.      My inexperience in the term  is the reason given for my implied demotion,   although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for  other players.          This had been the first month that I've had  access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k;     there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition.  I have notified Presto that I would be joining Doug in Ercot,   but would be considering other options in Houston,  or even Portland.     I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that.         The job in Houston may be a good opportunity,  however,   the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional  goals.  I am looking for other opportunities,  preferably within the company.     If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set,  let me know -   I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.       You certainly are under no obligation to do this,   but I am confident that my track record will generate some interest within the company,   possibly on the retail side.  Thanks for your time,  J Forney 
 i have notified Presto that I will be looking internally.    i am talking to portland,   as they want me back.      i have been moved to the Texas region to supply the Texas Choice and EES customers on an hourly basis.     I would manage this desk and, once again ,   have an hourly crew,  much the same as I did in California.      That is not the job I signed up for when I moved 3,000 miles to Houston.      I have already been there,  done that and I am not  pleased about it so far,   but it will be allright.      If I did this job,   it would become a big success and then I would have to hear about how lucky I was.  I'll keep you posted......it's shit like this that keeps work interesting.  JMF 
 Thanks for checking -  very unhappy with the situation here.    Very unprofessional and juvenile atmosphere.     Looking to leave the company if something doesnt open up internally.  JMF 
 Joan, I left a message for you today concerning your e-mail.      Do you still need someone?     I would like to ask you some specific questions again,  so give me a call.      I am at 3-7160.  Thanks, JMF 
 Elizabeth, My name is John Forney and I am the new Electricity  Cash trader in the Entergy region,  reporting to Kevin Presto.         I received a letter agreement from Entergy that seeks to clarify the Entergy  "Into"  definition.   Rogers Herndon has relayed that we have tried to get them to transact under an EEI agreement,  where they have been willing to only operate under WSPP.    They are trying to get us to agree to use the WSPP contract with EEI  liquidated damages language. I need to meet with you on this issue.   Rogers is available to anwer questions on the background of this ,   if necessary.   Thanks, JMF 3-7160 
 I am interested in obtaining parking in the new Enron  parking garage.    I am currently in the Kellogg building.  Thanks,  John Forney Director,  East Power Trading 3-7160 
 Bryan, please give me a call at 3-7160 to arrange meeting. 
   Please see the revised game plan for Monday.   Notice that hour ending 6 has been revised upward.  Thanks,  JMF 
 Things are going pretty well -  balance of month trading $43.75 in Entergy and it is going to be 90 degrees all of next week! I heard that PV is down and its 1,000 degrees in the desert -  you guys must be busy. Dave Ryan called for mild in the Northeast next week when Earthsat was preaching hot ........   did really well on that deal as I was short balmo  the Cinergy. He's the man (this week).  I saw Swerzbee and Motley at the K-derby.    That was a good time,  but it was bright sun and hot,  while we were wearing the traditional suit and tie. There was a trader at the party that weighed about 320.   He was wearing a black wool sportcoat and a khaki colored shirt.    He tried to take his coat off but strangers were dogging him about his sweat rings,  so he put it back on..........poor bastard.  Louisville Slugger factory and museum kicked ass.    They had all the original bats from Ty Cobb,  Babe Ruth, etc to current players. The have been custom making bats since like 1847.    Good trip -  see you there next year!  JMF 
 Chuck, Lee Dean with Primrose Oil called our West Desk to inquire about electricity service to their field in Texas.         His number is 940-322-1077. If you could pass this along to the appropriate salesperson,  I would appreciate it.    Thanks, JMF 
 Thanks for asking -   things are still pretty tough here, but  I determined to make it work.         I am a Director now - would your management be concerned about that?-  just curious.  JMF 
 Bill, I talked with Hans at the Autohaus and he relayed that the car was in good shape,  but did probably need a valve adjustment,  as you relayed.   Maybe also an oil leak fixed.     Also,   I asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing. The Porsche certainly requires more attention than most cars,  the clutch being a common and costly repair.  The exterior of the car is in fair condition.     Maybe a detail shop could tell me whether some of the scratches could be buffed out. I'm not sure if you have checked into painting while you had the car,  but you cant get it done inexpensively.  I am still interested in the car and I would like my wife to be able to take a look at it.     However,   I am leaving town tomorrow and wont be back until   Sunday.    Maybe we can meet then. If our discussions progress and you havent already sold or traded in the car,   I would like to have it checked out mechanically (at my cost)  and would like a detail shop to give me an assessment of what they could do with the finish. I realize the car is not perfect and it is eleven years old,  but it is a large investment.....  Thanks,  Bill for your time. My cell number is 713-412-7529.   JForney 
 Thanks for keeping me updated,  jackie! Seriously,   how are things going in the homeland?   Are you glad to be back?   Let me know what 's happening. I havent talked to brother Jimmy lately.   He is not answering his phone here. Say hello to the wife -  we never hear from anyone in Portland.  Knock em dead in your new
