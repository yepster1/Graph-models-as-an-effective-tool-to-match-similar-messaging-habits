 Approved. 
 FYI.     This was the detail provided to Sarabeth. 
 For Kathy:    How many have been submitted? 
 Any idea on when I can get your info? 
 The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to adjust for carry forwards we will.   Worst case is that the dollars will have to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed. 
 FYI 
 Brasher  Excellent Clements Strong Fenstad Satisfactory  These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some specifics for the last few months.     A short discussion with Phil might lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on Dave.     What are your thoughts? 
 I would like to see the results of that method before we just agreed to do so. 
 I'm fine. 
 Ultimately more definition, but for now, it's a good start. 
 Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.     I have seen nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC on that date, out of the office. 
 Approved. 
 FYI.   You got it! 
 We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget. Tracy has the point on this one.  Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments? 
 What is the deal? 
 Hi Felicia,  I would like to have one (1) AMEX gift certificate for $50.00 processed as soon as possible.  Thanks, Rod 
 Forgot the attachment. Here it is. 
 This is a work in Progress.

 I still have a PRC tomorrow am, but will let Kathy know my status as I get closer to lunch. 
 FYI 
 I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida, which is similar to your suggestion.     We did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the business in the name of, but that leaves the revenue in the venture and solves the fiduciary problem. 
 I guess I would only request that we get some review put in front of ETS' new Risk Management Officer and his crew, Jerry Peters.    I also understand that this is a part of the Revenue Management project. 
 Please approve and forward for payment.    Thanks. 
 This is a pretty high priority issue.   I discussed with Gary Smith and he wants us to do the review.    We probably should use a contractor to do this one. 
 Your pleasure. 
 Is there a good chart for Jerry's new org? 
 I will have both Jim Saunders and Jerry Peters in attendance. 
 Will he be having one the first tuesday of January, 1/2/01?     Sharron Westbrook @ ENRON 
 I can't make it.     I have another PRC to do.

 To the best of my knowledge, there are no market studies or other documents that have been prepared that appear to meet the requirements of 4c  Drew: Can you think of anything we may have done while you were in Omaha that might fit this request? 
 I think there is still the possibility that, just like has happened to El Paso, that Enforcement could still open the case since FERC is still out trying to find a way to get us.   It is true that the ALJ did not help them out, but that decision is not binding upon the commission.    Neither Stan, Drew or I are comfortable yet that we have the win.  We are pleased with the ALJ decision, but know that the ALJ did not get to the answer the Commission intended. 
 Has Cheryl seen the stuff?    Need to get her and Jerry on board as well.

 All spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed.	I want to make it clear that items for health, safety, security and reliability that need to be spent will be spent, if necessary, but all other spending needs to be slowed down as much as possible and delayed until further notice.   This is a directive I have just received from Stan.  Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 
 What was the original question? 
 This message was sent earlier today to the finance/accounting/operational support people in the group to make them aware that we are in need of slowing down the cash outflow.  Your assistance in this regard is important to the success of preserving capital at this critical time. 
 OK

 Thanks.    The date will probably have to move since the most recent events have some of us kind of hopping.    I understand that you have raised your forecast of the 4th qtr, significantly.    That's great.    Looking forward to the simple explanation. 
 Are moving our IT support into our world?     Will Nick need to replace him? 
 I am OK, as long as the budget dollars are available to do it. 
 We will propose to Stan and see where we are at that time.    If it was this week, the answer would probably be no. 
 I am only concerned about moving IT types into our world that were previously in Nick's world if the job responsibilities move with them.   Sounds like this is not the case, so I am OK. 
 Here it is, it is not yet in final form. 
 Maybe overkill, I would rather send them an email talking about the problems, and they have to let you 2 know when they going to use a space, and how they can coordinate stuff with you 2 instead of dictating.   I am little touchy right now about how to approach people, so we need to be careful.   I am open to more discussion on this, just would like to soften the tone a litlle. 
 Let me talk to Stan when he gets back to town.    Lou and I need to discuss with him, and we are a little occupied with the credit agreement stuff.

 I need to send this to Jeff and Ray and get it back agreed to before we can actually fund otherwise I am not comfortable with the agreement and the reps we are making.   The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreeement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and Enron Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:  The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to Enron will carry Enron Corp guaranties. The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors. The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and Enron and the rest of it's subsidiaries.  Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between Enron and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

 If we do this, we need to have both an internal group and an external group. 
 Does this make us feel better? 
 I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.

 Is the same true for the current estimate? 
  Kyle:  Please find attached file. Transportation & Storage Revenue is right off the Earning Model Income Statement. Carlton data can be found in the Commercial Function detail within the "Database" worksheet of the Earning Model. The Cash Flow verbiage is very general related to the subject matter, but does provide a business reason on a Direct Cash Flow basis for an item buried within the Indirect Cash Flow format. Call me if you have any further questions and I will attempt to get you through them.    I can also get you set up to get even more detailed answers if you would like.  Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178     Rod,  Thanks for the email.  Can you help me match the information in this email to your operating plan or cash flow analysis?  Kyle   <<AnnualStats.xls>>    (See attached file: AnnualStats.xls) 
 That is understood.    He will be taking Glisan's position which had the same restrictions on it.    I don't plan on giving him any data other than daily cash positions and forecasted cash positions.   There would be no purpose in giving him E&F data.  By the wya, Kevin needs to do the Marketing Affiliate stuff.

 I am going to begin discussions with the banks as soon as we get the Phase 5 financing locked down.     I would expect that we could have it in another month, unless I run into some kind of a buzz-saw out there, and I'll let you know as soon as I do. 
 If necessary I can go.  I will need to be in Houston on Wednesday am.

 No, because they are in networks.

 I want to make sure that we are looking out for our people at this point in time.    If there is someone who is having a particular problem, now is a time to be comforting.   I also want to make sure that we are doing everything in our power to reduce spending.   If you have a vacancy, now may be the time to consider do you really have to fill that job right now.

 As to P6, it is in the budget for next year, but we want to start this year.     Timing is never perfect. 
 Do we want to tighten these up somewhat? 
 Sounds reasonable to me. 
 Great Ideas. 
 These would be in the debt tests performed for the lenders.    Do you know the answers?

 That is one of the things we are working on.   At this point in time Dynegy will be responsible for this debt, if theyexercise their rights under the preferred stock agreements, which would leave them with common pledged to the lenders.

 Hi -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Please fix. 
 FYI 
 did you get mine? 
 Let me, as well as others, know the outcome. 
 Since we are no longer using Maverix, that guarantee can be done away with.    Are the rest all really with Enron?    In the underlying deals do we have any ability to ask for better than a guarantee if enron is downgraded? 
 FYI 
 Outside of normal business lines is outside of the pipelines and therefore is not subject to being an issue here. 
 This would be an Enron deal.    And we just have to get over the hurdles here. 
 Before we can sell the units need to be registered. 
 FYI 
 Can you help us out here from what you know?     I do not believe you can loan money to Enron.     Have you filed to be able to make the special dividend? 
 Great start. 
 Just forget about it, the company will not be reimbursing for attendance this year. 
 You need to begin thinking about what we could do here if we were asked to reduce staffing to save money? 
 I do not intend to approve reimbursement by the company for attendance.

 Great job! 
 Yes for sure. 
 The same to you and yours. 
 I have forwarded to Stan and agree with your perspective.    Could you begin to think about who those people might be if we decided to do something? 
 I guess I need some more definition.    If I am creating a new group and I have nobody in it, this doesn't make sense.    Can I get some definitions to go over this with Stan?   I am having some trouble with this concept, I guess, as it doesn't appear to make any sense.    Why wouldn't we give these groups 0 authority since we don't use them.   I also think we need to make some changes to the rest of the schedule.    Especially at the top. 
 Assume afudc as 100% debt at 6% 
 Do you have this data? 
 Thanks. 
 The data is actually aggregated and netted, the specific deal data is not provided.   The detail he described might be the aggregate of 40 deals at that point none of which may directly relate to transportation deals.   See the bolded data below.   The example given basically says I am in a position of having more gas at Ventura in January 2002 than I have commitments to sell by 10 MMCF/d.     Did you understand that?

 FYI 
 Probably.   Please call Kathy Campos to get on my calendar.     the margins for 2001 and 2002 are not the same and I didn't think we had 2001 in the other model in detail.    Existing includes Gallup, and it will be nearly imposiible to identify it as separate because there have been some changes to the original contracts for Gallup.   You can try, but now you are talking about getting into parts of contracts.    You have to remember it was an expansion, not a separate system and therefore there is no way to track the flows after the fact. 
  This is a test for the blackberry. Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 
 What do you have to backup the 2001 and 2002 revenue projectoions for NNG? 
 They took bids and I think have an offer of about $60 MM or so.  Michael: What do you know about this one? 
 I have asked Kevin to sit in on this one for me.   Trailblazer on wednesday am. 
  I am having trouble getting this to you.   So I am trying again.     Also do you have any inventory that could be sold that is not encumbered already.   Trying to think about what could be done to improve your cash in the short term. 
 I have asked and will let you know the answer later today.    The bigger question is that they can not loan money to Enron and can only dividend, so if they can do something to raise the cash, they still can't get it out any more out than they can by dividending.    The other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred, and were advised to wait.   Their receivables from California are part of the problem.   More update later. 
 Is the cost center in question allocated or direct charged?  The corporate Enron Corp Business Controls cost center. 
 You can use my office but I may not be here. 
 Why do our numbers look so high in the 4th quarter and then fall off so much?     We have to get a better handle on all of this and fast. 
 I could probably do by phone and may be here. 
 I have been in discussions with them as well, and I don't think they have that flexibility.      Who has actually been working on the move for you?    I will have Pam Daily from my Admin Team contact you for specifics. 
 test2  Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 
 Either Robert Guthrie or greek Rice. 
 The deal with the Banks is being held up by Paribas to get a cross-netting agreement with Enron.   I understand we have agreed and the documentation could be done as early as today.   Bill Bradford is working on this one.   So it's up to Enron to fix the problem at this point in time.   PAribas releases and we get the agreement in place and we can start moving these LC's. 
 This position is truly needed in Omaha to provide support as Patty suggests.    I only wish there was a way to move someone from here to there. 
 What is the next step at this point in time? 
 no 
 We probably need to get this stuff in the hands of a few more people to make this work smoothly. 
 Do you have anyone from Accounting?   Saunders? 
 55% TW and 45% NNG 
 The 2 of you should probably listen in on this stuff to make sure you don't have some of the info needed

 I am getting ready to announce that I am bringing Kevin Howard into EGS as Vice President of Finance and Transaction Support.    Thinking about the current organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer in his organization?   The kind of things she is doing for you currently are similar to the kind of things we are going to have Kevin working with Corp on.   I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talents and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some others.    We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for themselves.    His group will be providing services to all, but I am willing to carve out some priorities.  Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178

 I will keep it on the calendar but cannot promise anything at this point in time. 
 First of all, why can't we do a deal with Northern Plain's, a wholly owned subsidiary? 
 fyi. 
 Will Keith Marlowe be in attendance? 
 Not as far as I know. 
 Don't know. 
 FYI 
 Looks like there may have been a little confusion here, but it appears that the deal is still working as before. 
 Not at this time.   I think as long as Enron is performing, I'm not sure why there is all of this noise. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I have already approved and forwarded. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Yes and yes, but it will take me another day or so for the announcement -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Sally: Where do I go inside Enron to get straight what it is that I need to do in order to be able to use the curves I am told that we need to be using?  Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 
 I think the biggest problem is that where are we going to get the funds for that? 
 FYI 
 Let's forward to the ETS Officer's for review/comments to be discussed monday am. 
 I think the real problem right now is that until the current crisis is over we need to reduce all calls for cash of any type to only those necessary to make cash today. 
 And we will give you something stating or reaffirming our deal, if that is deemed to be necessary.     It will be worth the paper it is written on at the moment it is written, but means nothing 1 second later, and that's the problem with these kind of things.     I guess my concern is what good will it do anyone?    I don't think it's a problem to get, however I do believe we would want to get V&E's opinion at the time we wanted it, that it was necessary/required. 
 Probably need additional review by someone now, given the current situation.  What do you think?  -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Agreed.     By the way we are very close to a deal and therefore a press release shortly thereafter. 
 Can you please get with Roger and make sure we understand what needs to be done? 
 I am trying to get a decision, but I think we need to maintain flexibility, if at all possible. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 Still want to try and get it done this year. Per Stan this am. Cash is king for now and we need thepricing to get the rest of the cash.   If it has to be pushed to next year, that works, but if it can be done it needs to be. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net) 
 I understand now.     Thanks.

 tHANKS. 
 What can we do about getting this done? 
 FYI 
 I am not sure, I just am being a little overly cautious about making changes that someone at corporate may not be aware of. 
 Can someone send us a synopsis of the changes in the plan and what the expected impact on NP and NBP services comapny is? 
 Let's try this time on for size! 
 We will have to do project economics by pipeline as well as in total.    A way to allocate costs however is to do so according to the benefits received.      That way no one can argue that they didn't get the same deal.    If the deal makes sense from a group standpoint, then it should make sense from an individual pipeline standpoint.  Project economics need to be looked at in 2 ways.     1) The project economics on a stand alone basis and then 2) the more accurate approach of what does the project do to the entity (the with and without approach). The accounting return in the second approach has become actually the more important measure of success. 
 In order for me to effectively represent you at the ETS PRC  and for some of you at the Accounting and Finance PRC's I will need some information from each of you.      Please send the following to Kathy Campos who will put it together for me in a book.  1. Copy of your goals for 2000 and the latest status. 2. A list of accomplishments/things you are proud of this year, specifically indicate any involvement in the    Associates/Analysts Program or the Recruiting Program. 3. Copy of a Self Evaluation you completed in the PEP System. 4. Your Supervisor will provide me with a Copy of a Preliminary Evaluation.  I will need these by the 29th of November for those in the accounting and finance ranks.   For all others I will need the input for the 13th of December. 
 FYI 
 All OK> 
 Please provide whatever assistance you can in getting info to Tracy to respond to the attached request. 
 A reminder of what was in the Enron goal presentation and what we did last year. 
 FYI 
 Please approve and forward for payment.    Thanks. 
 I guess I would only request that we get some review put in front of ETS' new Risk Management Officer and his crew, Jerry Peters.    I also understand that this is a part of the Revenue Management project. 
 I would like to have the dollars subdivided into pools for each of my direct reports with about 10% of my pool reserved for my use.    Can you help me with this?    I also understand that we are doing a handoff from Ben to Shanna for my support point, therefore I am sending this to both of you.  For Ben:    Where are we on the job description I sent 
 I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida, which is similar to your suggestion.     We did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the business in the name of, but that leaves the revenue in the venture and solves the fiduciary problem. 
 I still have a PRC tomorrow am, but will let Kathy know my status as I get closer to lunch. 
 FYI 
 This is a work in Progress. 
 Forgot the attachment. Here it is. 
 Hi Felicia,  I would like to have one (1) AMEX gift certificate for $50.00 processed as soon as possible.  Thanks, Rod 
 What is the deal? 
 We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget. Tracy has the point on this one.  Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments? 
 Do you have the same for the income side? 
 FYI.   You got it! 
 Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.     I have seen nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC on that date, out of the office. 
 Ultimately more definition, but for now, it's a good start. 
 I'm fine. 
 I would like to see the results of that method before we just agreed to do so. 
 Brasher  Excellent Clements Strong Fenstad Satisfactory  These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some specifics for the last few months.     A short discussion with Phil might lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on Dave.     What are your thoughts? 
 FYI 
 The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to adjust for carry forwards we will.   Worst case is that the dollars will have to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed. 
 Any idea on when I can get your info? 
 For Kathy:    How many have been submitted? 
 FYI.    This close date is of large significance to GPG as we are going to be asking management to wait an extra week for monthly info that ties out to the financials.     This variance from what we thought was a "Common Design" is a huge deal, in fact the agreed upon close timing was a major consideration in getting agreement within GPG to go forward as it was an improvement that we could see had value.   I agreed to and "stacked hands" with all on the "Common Design", yet somehow there has been a failure to deliver the "Common Design".   I just want to make sure that the two of you are aware of my position on this issue. 
 FYI.     This was the detail provided to Sarabeth.

 What were the individual participation rates by entity?      Shirley Jo Wilson  12/12/2000 
 This is an FYI, but I think that Insurance probably fits into Jerry's world. 
 I can't make it.     I have another PRC to do. 
 Will he be having one the first tuesday of January, 1/2/01?     Sharron Westbrook @ ENRON 
 I will have both Jim Saunders and Jerry Peters in attendance. 
 FYI 
 Approved. 
 Approved. 
 I haven't heard back from Rebecca on this, but I'm sure she is busy.   Do either of you care to answer my question below. 
 I didn't forget. 
 Do you still have the instructions for the wire to Compass Bank in the files?   I would like it wired there. 
 Here is the info: Bank:   Compass Bank Transit #: 113 010 547 Account #: 0600 1564 For credit to the account of Roderick J. and Kathleen R. Hayslett  Thanks.   I would like this done as soon as possible as I will be needing the funds at the end of the week. Rod Hayslett
