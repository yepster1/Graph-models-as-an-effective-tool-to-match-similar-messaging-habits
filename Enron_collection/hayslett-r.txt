 Approved. 
 FYI.     This was the detail provided to Sarabeth. 
 For Kathy:    How many have been submitted? 
 Any idea on when I can get your info? 
 The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to adjust for carry forwards we will.   Worst case is that the dollars will have to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed. 
 FYI 
 Brasher  Excellent Clements Strong Fenstad Satisfactory  These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some specifics for the last few months.     A short discussion with Phil might lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on Dave.     What are your thoughts? 
 I would like to see the results of that method before we just agreed to do so. 
 I'm fine. 
 Ultimately more definition, but for now, it's a good start. 
 Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.     I have seen nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC on that date, out of the office. 
 Approved. 
 FYI.   You got it! 
 We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget. Tracy has the point on this one.  Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments? 
 What is the deal? 
 Hi Felicia,  I would like to have one (1) AMEX gift certificate for $50.00 processed as soon as possible.  Thanks, Rod 
 Forgot the attachment. Here it is. 
 This is a work in Progress.

 I still have a PRC tomorrow am, but will let Kathy know my status as I get closer to lunch. 
 FYI 
 I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida, which is similar to your suggestion.     We did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the business in the name of, but that leaves the revenue in the venture and solves the fiduciary problem. 
 I guess I would only request that we get some review put in front of ETS' new Risk Management Officer and his crew, Jerry Peters.    I also understand that this is a part of the Revenue Management project. 
 Please approve and forward for payment.    Thanks. 
 This is a pretty high priority issue.   I discussed with Gary Smith and he wants us to do the review.    We probably should use a contractor to do this one. 
 Your pleasure. 
 Is there a good chart for Jerry's new org? 
 I will have both Jim Saunders and Jerry Peters in attendance. 
 Will he be having one the first tuesday of January, 1/2/01?     Sharron Westbrook @ ENRON 
 I can't make it.     I have another PRC to do.

 To the best of my knowledge, there are no market studies or other documents that have been prepared that appear to meet the requirements of 4c  Drew: Can you think of anything we may have done while you were in Omaha that might fit this request? 
 I think there is still the possibility that, just like has happened to El Paso, that Enforcement could still open the case since FERC is still out trying to find a way to get us.   It is true that the ALJ did not help them out, but that decision is not binding upon the commission.    Neither Stan, Drew or I are comfortable yet that we have the win.  We are pleased with the ALJ decision, but know that the ALJ did not get to the answer the Commission intended. 
 Has Cheryl seen the stuff?    Need to get her and Jerry on board as well.

 All spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed.	I want to make it clear that items for health, safety, security and reliability that need to be spent will be spent, if necessary, but all other spending needs to be slowed down as much as possible and delayed until further notice.   This is a directive I have just received from Stan.  Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 
 What was the original question? 
 This message was sent earlier today to the finance/accounting/operational support people in the group to make them aware that we are in need of slowing down the cash outflow.  Your assistance in this regard is important to the success of preserving capital at this critical time. 
 OK

 Thanks.    The date will probably have to move since the most recent events have some of us kind of hopping.    I understand that you have raised your forecast of the 4th qtr, significantly.    That's great.    Looking forward to the simple explanation. 
 Are moving our IT support into our world?     Will Nick need to replace him? 
 I am OK, as long as the budget dollars are available to do it. 
 We will propose to Stan and see where we are at that time.    If it was this week, the answer would probably be no. 
 I am only concerned about moving IT types into our world that were previously in Nick's world if the job responsibilities move with them.   Sounds like this is not the case, so I am OK. 
 Here it is, it is not yet in final form. 
 Maybe overkill, I would rather send them an email talking about the problems, and they have to let you 2 know when they going to use a space, and how they can coordinate stuff with you 2 instead of dictating.   I am little touchy right now about how to approach people, so we need to be careful.   I am open to more discussion on this, just would like to soften the tone a litlle. 
 Let me talk to Stan when he gets back to town.    Lou and I need to discuss with him, and we are a little occupied with the credit agreement stuff.

 I need to send this to Jeff and Ray and get it back agreed to before we can actually fund otherwise I am not comfortable with the agreement and the reps we are making.   The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreeement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and Enron Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:  The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to Enron will carry Enron Corp guaranties. The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors. The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and Enron and the rest of it's subsidiaries.  Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between Enron and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

 If we do this, we need to have both an internal group and an external group. 
 Does this make us feel better? 
 I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.
