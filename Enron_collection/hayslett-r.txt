 Approved. 
 FYI.     This was the detail provided to Sarabeth. 
 For Kathy:    How many have been submitted? 
 Any idea on when I can get your info? 
 The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to adjust for carry forwards we will.   Worst case is that the dollars will have to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed. 
 FYI 
 Brasher  Excellent Clements Strong Fenstad Satisfactory  These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some specifics for the last few months.     A short discussion with Phil might lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on Dave.     What are your thoughts? 
 I would like to see the results of that method before we just agreed to do so. 
 I'm fine. 
 Ultimately more definition, but for now, it's a good start. 
 Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.     I have seen nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC on that date, out of the office. 
 Approved. 
 FYI.   You got it! 
 We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget. Tracy has the point on this one.  Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments? 
 What is the deal? 
 Hi Felicia,  I would like to have one (1) AMEX gift certificate for $50.00 processed as soon as possible.  Thanks, Rod 
 Forgot the attachment. Here it is. 
 This is a work in Progress. 
 FYI 
 I still have a PRC tomorrow am, but will let Kathy know my status as I get closer to lunch. 
 FYI 
 I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida, which is similar to your suggestion.     We did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the business in the name of, but that leaves the revenue in the venture and solves the fiduciary problem. 
 I guess I would only request that we get some review put in front of ETS' new Risk Management Officer and his crew, Jerry Peters.    I also understand that this is a part of the Revenue Management project. 
 Please approve and forward for payment.    Thanks. 
 This is a pretty high priority issue.   I discussed with Gary Smith and he wants us to do the review.    We probably should use a contractor to do this one. 
 Your pleasure. 
 Is there a good chart for Jerry's new org? 
 I will have both Jim Saunders and Jerry Peters in attendance. 
 Will he be having one the first tuesday of January, 1/2/01?     Sharron Westbrook @ ENRON 
 I can't make it.     I have another PRC to do. 
 This is an FYI, but I think that Insurance probably fits into Jerry's world. 
 What were the individual participation rates by entity?      Shirley Jo Wilson  12/12/2000

 We won't have a permanent place until sometime after the end of December. 
 What's the first day you have free for lunch? 
 Do you have a history with Hughes?

 I would be happy to do so.   Do you have a preference, or Lawrence do you have a preference as to how this is handled?  Should someone from the pipes be in the bank meeting, for moral support, if not for the steel. 
 Do you have his number? 
 Was there a plan here, like you guys decided to not pay, or was this just overlooked? 
 Yes, my mistake.

 That would work well if I was trying to do projects, but I am trying to be able to utilize the curves in the business to measure VaR.    We now use them for NNG & TW in the Caminus System, and want to do so for our other pipes as well. 
 I agree.   Let's go.

 To the best of my knowledge, there are no market studies or other documents that have been prepared that appear to meet the requirements of 4c  Drew: Can you think of anything we may have done while you were in Omaha that might fit this request? 
 I think there is still the possibility that, just like has happened to El Paso, that Enforcement could still open the case since FERC is still out trying to find a way to get us.   It is true that the ALJ did not help them out, but that decision is not binding upon the commission.    Neither Stan, Drew or I are comfortable yet that we have the win.  We are pleased with the ALJ decision, but know that the ALJ did not get to the answer the Commission intended. 
 Has Cheryl seen the stuff?    Need to get her and Jerry on board as well. 
 Just catch Cheryl up then on the changes. 
 That works for me.   I will attempt to answer some of Heather's questions as well.

 I am in agreement with Tod on #1.    It's your call, but you should make the call on whether or not we will integrate it into Enron.   If we do, then we will get Adam the help he needs, but it will be more efficient than providing stand alone support.

 All spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed.	I want to make it clear that items for health, safety, security and reliability that need to be spent will be spent, if necessary, but all other spending needs to be slowed down as much as possible and delayed until further notice.   This is a directive I have just received from Stan.  Rod Hayslett EB4054 713-853-6178 
 What was the original question? 
 This message was sent earlier today to the finance/accounting/operational support people in the group to make them aware that we are in need of slowing down the cash outflow.  Your assistance in this regard is important to the success of preserving capital at this critical time. 
 OK 
 Got me to thinking, how are you guys doing?    Where are you in the cash management world?     I know you were tight before, is the situation any better?

 THe enron situation has slowed down the process as we have not been able to get a clean OK from the SEC to go forward as yet. 
 I will work with her and Dan to try and figure out a better solution in the short term.     Now that some space is available from the moves to the new building, it is possible that there is a better place to move to for a period of time. 
 Not before you scheduled the meeting.   Only as a result of it. 
 CAll Stan when you get in probably closer to 7 our time.
