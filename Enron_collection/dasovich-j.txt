 On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee. The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage. Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like. The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday. In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access. The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25. We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1. We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 Call when you can. Best, Jeff 
 Greetings, Jim. Just checking in.  Hope, given the circumstances that all finds you well. Look forward to hearing from you.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey Suzie, what's up with that weather.  And speaking of up, our stock's up today!!  Keep your fingers crossed.  Best, Jeff 
 Got your message.  Which bill?  Could you try Scott Govenar (916.448.8240), since he's the lord of all bill activity?  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Didn't work.  Was it in yesterday's gas daily?  If so, I can access it.  Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. The California AG has announced that he is investigating conflict of interest charges against consultants who were involved with arranging DWR's long term power contracts. May be part of Davis' attempt to "re-negotiate" the contracts.  There's been some assertions that, under California law, any contracts negotiated by consultants with financial conflict of interests must be nullified. 
 Sue will take the lead on the ARM filing.  Let's discuss further the idea of a separate Enron filing--pros and cons to each.  Sue and Jeanne Bennett discussed and thought coalition filings would be preferable, but let's talk about it.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Hope, given the circumstances, that you're well.  I'm trying to get a hold of Mark Baldwin, and the number I have gets a recording saying that it ain't the number anymore.  Do you have a number for him.  Greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 OK, I'm getting the meetings set up.  What day do you want?  And what about the pilot--need info, over.  And who's you're knight in shining armor in EES?  Best, Jeff 
 It's Baldwin.  Let me know what dates you want to meet and I'll set it up.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll give you a call and fax you some materials that Edison uses to justify their position.  Best, Jeff 
 Does Martha approve of aloe vera? 
 Thanks. 
 Greetings.  Steve Harris says that you might have a number for Mark Baldwin.  Possible to get it from you.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  Did he change companies, or just phone numbers?  Best, Jeff 
 Got Mark's number.  I'm going to call him today.  Any specific info you'd like to have, or just generally what he and DWR are up to on the gas side.  I also assume that we'd like to meet with him to discuss possible opportunities?  Best, Jeff 
 thanks. 
 I've mentioned both Becky and Leslie to Barry. 
 Let me see what I can do.  So this is all about sourcing, or are you aiming higher? 
 Could be a soon as the next week or two.  We'll make sure that you're up to date on the latest.  Best, Jeff 
 Sorry.  Haven't been around.  I definitely want to move forward.  I'll respond more fully if more is needed, but the short of it is, I'd like to do the entire job except for the decking.  Ready to start when you are.  Can you tell me what you expect the total to be (labor + materials), understanding that it's an estimate and not a firm price.  Also, I'm assuming that the cost for the materials that you quoted include the "bridge" to the cabin?  Will, of course, want the bridge to the cabin planked.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Really appreciate your efforts.  Looking forward to getting started.  Hope all finds you well.  Best, Jeff 
  State's Electric Bill Gets Lighter   Energy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.  By MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writer  October 20 2001  SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday.  Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added.  The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation.  Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans.  Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts.  California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers.  In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion.  But in what consumer groups angrily called a "jailbreak," Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs.  Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers  The PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis.  However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers.  "Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers," said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. "Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers."  State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the "stampede" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity.  "What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis," Angelides said.  And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis.  "The PUC first gave Edison their bailout," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. "Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place."  But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission's figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said.  Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration's request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said.  The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said.  "If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve," Lynch said. "The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts."  Also adding to the state's financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan's interest rates.  The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state's planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve.  Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on Strategy  In a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them.  If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely.  In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive.  But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks.  "I don't think it's real smart to tell you that," said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary. 
 State lowers estimate of energy costs Consumers might see rates decrease Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau <mailto:lgledhill@sfchronicle.com> Saturday, October 20, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/20/MN39027.DTL>  Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result.  Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated.  The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour.  "Circumstances have changed," said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. "Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market."  Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC,  and Gov. Gray Davis' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts.  But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive.  It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases.  At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion.  Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers.  The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent.  "What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis," Angelides said yesterday.  He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1.  But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature.  She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said. 
 Uggh.  I think I'm at Stanford that evening. 
  In a speech last night at Standford's Hoover Institution, Abraham announced the money to Upgrade Path 15 and said it should be completed by '03.  Said a consortium of IOUs (including PG&E), munis and generators will participate.   Press is also reporting this morning that Davis administration is confirming that it's trying to rework some of the long-term DWR contracts.   Best, Jeff 
 Sam:  Congratulations.  But I've been informed that the buring chicken in the office kitchen ate up about 10% of the emission credits previously secured for the plant.

Best,  Jeff  Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects  10/18/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said.  The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.  Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission.  GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand.  The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002.  Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.  -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com 
 Sweetie, what happened?  How'd you hurt your back?  So sorry.  And SO sorry that this isn't working out for anyone.  I really wanted to see you guys and REALLY wanted to ride.  Another day, I guess.  Take care of that back.  Herniated disks are bad, so take care.  Best, Jeff 
 Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the secondary market.)  Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.  But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.  That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?  Best, Jeff 
 You want to handle, or you want me to take a stab at it?

 Thanks.  Look forward to talking soon.  Don't work too hard.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  See you tomorrow night in the tah moh. 
 Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like. He said that his "legal and tariff guys" told him that "they're on solid ground"; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison "is right." I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or ("god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC. I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue. He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days). He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check. I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.  Possible to discuss briefly?  Best, Jeff

 That ain't gonna do it, in my view.  We're going to need to be creative.  Figure what number we'll take and how we'll take it and get out.  Note that Edison is going to be very wary of showing any "preferential treatment," lest another creditor get wind of it and yank them in on an involuntary.  I'm going to call Tribolet and get his thoughts.  I'll let you know what he says.  Best, Jeff

  Dan Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray Davis' standing plummets    (Published Oct. 7, 2001)  A year ago, Gray Davis was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo.  Davis' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings.  Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame.  Davis' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months.  The seriousness of Davis' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis. History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis.  Davis' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups.  How big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that Davis' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991. Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history.  However large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review.  It's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis' own appointees to the PUC are balking. Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But Davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure.  The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned.  _____  The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com <mailto:dwalters@sacbee.com>.

 No Steffes?  Talk to you at 1.  Best, Jeff 
 I just talked to Kip Lipper--works for Byron Sher, but Burton relies on him alot.  He's drafting the letter that Burton will send to Loretta re: what to do about DA.  I've given Kip the quotes from Angelides re: State's fiscal position will remain STRONG through JULY 2001 irrespective of whether the bonds are issued.  Kip was not aware of the quotes and was anxious to get them. I reminded Kip that the only reason anyone's given to suspend DA is the urgent need to issue the bonds, but now, even the Treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds. I told Kip that the letter to Loretta should say 1) there is no longer any need to suspend DA whatsoever, 2) the PUC should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of DA and 3) the PUC should deliver to the Legislature a study recommending any enhancements, modifications, etc. that should be made to the program to ensure that DA is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed.  He said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us.  There is a concerted effort underway to get the PUC to reject outright at tomorrow's meeting the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC, and DWR's proposed rev. req.  The reason:  no urgency anymore.  Let's take a little time and get it right.  Best, Jeff 
 If it's possible to talk around 3 pm California time for about 10-15 minutes, that would be great.  Would need to get Jim and Rick on the call, too.  Don't break your back, but would be very good if we could arrange it.  Just let me know.  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you.  I was trying to get the number from Barry. 
 Give a call when you get in. Let's discuss this further in prep for my follow-up call with Fielder tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 That's helpful.  Thanks.  Needed a time frame.  Today's going to be very interesting. Should be able to get you something before 10; before noon, max.  Best, Jeff 
 will do. 
 Interesting assist from Jones? 
 Thanks a bunch. 
 Thanks.  Don't hesitate if there's anything else.  We're trying to get Bilas and Duque on board.  Best, Jeff

  Firms Push Edison Near Bankruptcy   Energy: Power generators ask firm to spell out how they will be repaid hundreds of millions of dollars for purchases under deregulation plan.  By NANCY VOGEL and JERRY HIRSCH TIMES STAFF WRITERS  September 29 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Five big energy companies owed hundreds of millions of dollars by Southern California Edison pushed the utility a step closer to bankruptcy Friday by asking Edison to sign an agreement spelling out how each will be repaid.  The companies demanded that Edison meet with them within two weeks to work out a repayment plan and implied that otherwise they would drag the Rosemead-based utility into Bankruptcy Court. Under federal law, any three creditors can force a company to file for bankruptcy if they are owed a combined $10,775. The five generating companies collectively are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, although the exact total is not known.  The letter was a significant step in maneuvering over Edison's fate--a dance that has gone on for months but now appears to be nearing its close. Edison has been reaching deals with some of its creditors, but has kept others waiting. Some power generators, in turn, have been threatening to push Edison into bankruptcy, although so far only Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy have publicly embraced that idea. And Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders have continued to debate a plan that the governor believes could avoid a bankruptcy.  The letter, sent by William Bates III, a Palo Alto attorney representing the five power generators, expressed frustration that Edison so far has been unwilling to work out a repayment plan with large power producers. Under the Edison rescue plan that the Legislature debated and ultimately adjourned without passing earlier this month, Edison would have settled with its smaller creditors but been left with $1 billion in debt to big power sellers.  "This group of creditors is significant in both number and amount and deserves and requires to be dealt with as such," says the letter to Edison's private attorney, Thomas B. Walper of Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles.  "We would be willing to discuss any ideas SCE has" about an agreement to repay its debt, the letter continues, "but we don't want to waste anybody's time. Thus, as a first step we want to know whether SCE is interested in negotiating. . . . Please give us a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer to that question.  "Of course, we reserve all our rights and remedies in the event that SCE does not want to meet on these terms or we cannot reach a mutually satisfactory agreement," Bates wrote.  The five companies are Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy Corp., Enron Corp. and Puget Sound Energy, which is the biggest investor-owned utility in Washington state.  Edison officials refused to comment.  The frustration on the part of the power generators appeared to mount Tuesday, when Edison announced that it had reached an agreement to pay off its $14-million debt to the city of Long Beach, which sold Edison electricity produced at a trash-fueled power plant on Terminal Island.  Edison has also reached repayment plans with many small and renewable power producers who collectively are owed $1.2 billion.  "Edison can take steps to assure that all creditor classes are treated equally," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, which is owed $100 million to $200 million by Edison.  A spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant, which is also owed more than $100 million, sounded a similar note. "It is time SCE made clear when, how much and even if it is going to pay us," Patrick Dorinson said.  So far, other creditors have balked at the idea of pushing Edison into bankruptcy, believing that a judge would probably consider a bankruptcy petition premature until after the Legislature meets Oct. 9 in a special session to deal exclusively with Edison's plight.  Davis, who insists that Edison should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy, ordered the new session earlier this month after legislators adjourned without passing any legislation that would shrink Edison's debt.  Other Creditors Take Notice  Senate leader John Burton, (D-San Francisco), has said that any such bill would have to guarantee that the burden of paying off the utility's $3.9-billion debt does not fall on homeowners and small-business owners.  The letter from the five generators caught the attention of other creditors who have so far played along with SCE's strategy of winning a legislative rescue.  "From our perspective, the days of luxury for Edison are over," said John Moorlach, Orange County treasurer. The county holds $1 million of defaulted SCE bonds in its retirement plan.  Moorlach said he believes that if SCE does not quickly reach an agreement with the generators, they will push the utility into Bankruptcy Court.  "By doing this, the generators are trying to show that they are making a good-faith effort to reach a settlement first," Moorlach said.  But Jay Lawrence, spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, said his members believe the move by the generators shows they have backed off from an immediate involuntary bankruptcy petition filing, at least while they try to open negotiations with SCE.  "We still want to see a legislative solution, and we are against bankruptcy," Lawrence said.  Edison provides electricity to 11 million people. It racked up the $3.9-billion debt over the past year as it purchased high-priced electricity in the fledgling market California created under a 1996 deregulation plan. The state's deregulation plan included a rate freeze that barred Edison from passing the full cost of the power it bought on to customers.  By January, Edison's debt had grown so heavy that power sellers refused to deal with the utility. The state had to step in with taxpayer money to keep electricity flowing. So far, the state has spent $10.7 billion on power purchases.  Edison's counterpart in Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric, suffered the same financial squeeze in the state's dysfunctional market. PG&E took itself into bankruptcy in April.  The generators' demand came on a day when Edison officials said they were close to winning an agreement from bankers to delay collecting on $200 million in loans until Oct. 19.  Shares of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, rose almost 5% Friday to close at $13.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.  *  Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this report.

 I think ours has bigger issues associated with it... 
 thanks so much. please call me at office.  best, Jeff 
 Just found out that the best way to reach Bob Lane is on his cell phone at: 415-713-4473.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll give you a call.  Man, were you all over NPR or what with that Telco story?  Give my best to Tina.  Best, Jeff 
 yes.  send through. 
 Attemps are still underway to persuade the California PUC not to suspend DA at today's meeting. However, the best information we have at this time is that the PUC will suspend DA today, but will not suspend DA retroactively. As best we can tell, if the PUC suspends, it will suspend DA effective today, September 20th. In addition, there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the PUC to reject 1) the proposed rate agreement between the PUC and DWR and 2) the proposed "revenue requirement" that DWR submitted to the PUC.  We'll report back with the results of the PUC business meeting as soon as we hear them.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Colleen: I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.  Best, Jeff 
 It appears that Davis has officially called the Legislature back to try to address the Edison issue.  Appears they'll reconvene beginning next Tuesday.  We'll report back when we get additional information.  There are some rumors going around that they might meet and simply appoint a "task force" comprised of legislators to continue working on the issue.  Burton is reported to have said that he's telling senators who are on vacation that "this isn't worth cancelling a vacation over."  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Did you folks ever send a letter to the PUC?  If so, is it possible to get a copy?  Best, Jeff 
 Given that 1) the PUC has quite a few important issues on its agenda and 2) the PUC meeting will likely coincide with our regularly scheduled meeting time, we'll reschedule our 11:30 AM PDT call to 3 PM PDT for today only.  With the Legislature adjourned (thankfully), we'll re-assess the need for a twice-weekly call and get back to folks.  The potential for a 3rd extraordinary session may affect what we do.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call.  Best, Jeff 
 So I'm assuming that you support the plan?  Best, Jeff 
 You're a better consumer advocate than apologist.  I'll resend the document first thing in the AM.  Best, Jeff 
 You should contact Tim directly.  There is a tariff section on each website and a search function using key words.  The utilities issue reports on OFO incidents, and Tim should have those as well.  Let me know if there's anything we can do.  Best, Jeff 
 Bet Mike ain't thrilled about not being the firm to draft this...How's it look thus far? 
 FYI.  You know if Tim's still at Enron?  I haven't heard from him for quite some time. Best, Jeff 
 Can you reschedule this to 3 PM our time?  Mucho Appreciado.  Best, Jeff

 will do. 
 415.228.4550 code 92105 
 Talked to Mark.  First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals. He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR. I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs. He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office. He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting. I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting? I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.  Best, Jeff 
 u wanna go? 
 Thanks.  We do not have internet access here.  Would you please see if they= post a more detailed version of the proposal, and, if so, distribute.  Tha= nks.  (This is going to blow the roof off in California.)  Best, Jeff

 Getting alot of inquiries.  The PUC has not yet voted on suspension of DA or related matters. Likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes. Looks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension. In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision). Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).  KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.  We'll report back as soon as something happens.  For folks who want to listen in, the number is:  415.228.4550 code = 92105  Best, Jeff 
 I got the "joke." 
 Is there an attachment? 
 You interested in these messages? 
 Unless there's an issue, I'll call Fielder first thing this morning.  I'm not seeing any upside to us rattling any sabers regarding bankruptcy, however.  We'd likely take a very significant reputational and political hit by taking them in---or suggesting that we would take them in, for that matter.  Reliant and Mirant have been rattling theirs for a very long time---with no concrete action to back them up.  They would of course love to have Enron "lead the charge."  I would recommend that we not play that card right now and let Reliant and Mirant go forward if they choose.  Best, Jeff 
 My lapton is not working so I do not have access to my usual mail lists.  Apologies.   About 1 AM this morning, Burton closed down the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU. Burton said there weren't the votes for it (which is true; there were about 6 votes for the MOU in the Senate), and he didn't want to "embarrass" Davis. Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers. Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU.  The special session would begin in about 2 weeks. Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.  A press account and Davis' statement are attached.  Best,  Jeff  GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION  Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy  SACRAMENTO  Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win approval in the California State Senate.  "I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness. Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.  "It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000 Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts, back on-line earlier this summer.  "I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its creditors will continue to show restraint."    ###    California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer Saturday, September 15, 2001 ?2001 Associated Press  URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL>  (09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --  The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility.  As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds.  But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday.  "We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation."  The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt.  Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts.  The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy.  "I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done."  The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school.  The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing.  It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders.  While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds.  Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks.  The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks.  The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal.  "Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.  ?2001 Associated Press

 Hear you're in London.  Hope you're OK.  Unfathomable tragedy.  We're going to hold our 11:30 call in an attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy.  Call will be brief.  With respect to Hap, John's asked me to hold off talking to him until John signals.  I agreed.  I'll keep you posted.  The State Capitol is closed down completely today.  Be safe.  Best, Jeff 
 The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th. The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01. But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues. How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time. The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much. Please thank Mark.  Best, Jeff 
  The Commission also delayed a decision on whether contract renewal will be included under the suspension.  Jeff 
 Dan.  You might want to amend.  The decision puts everyone on notice that t= he Commission is going to consider taking it back to July 1---no info on wh= at the decision process would be. =20 Best, Jeff

 Thank god.  I have a commrade in email humilation.  Thank you, Joseph.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Scott.  Though the chances of re-kindling a bi-partisan, centrist deal among Rs, Ds and Davis are extremely small.  Richmond (Republican leading Assembly efforts) has agreed to stay in touch with  Bev over the weekend in the very unlikely event that something rekindles between Rs and Ds.  In the meantime, with Davis and the Assembly Ds drifting back to the left, we'll need to redouble our own efforts to make sure we don't lose the ground we've gained.  Scott, are they meeting again on  Monday, or Tuesday?  Best, Jeff 
 Don't know.  I'll find out.  Any sensitivity if we had?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 will do.  traffic permitting, around 7? 
 The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today. If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today. It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today. If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote. That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature. Will report back with the events of the Assembly.  Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).  Best, Jeff 
 Please update with other info.  Jim 
 Yes, would like a copy.  Thanks. 
 Yes.  Likely not 100% of what you're looking for, but likely some info that will be useful.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm signed up.  Work kept me away.  What happened.  Do I need to be doing anything?  Best, Jeff 
 I absolutely could not BELIEVE that he sent this note. Unreal. 
 Hey.  Work prevented me from going to class at all last nite.  Does the course seem like it will be good?  Were there a million people there?  Chances are very low that I'll get in, but I'm gonna try anyway.  I'm on vacation next week (yeah), but maybe we can catch during the break on the following Tuesday or Wednesday.  Good to see you the other night.  Take care.  Best, Jeff 
 "Democratic leaders may bounce a Kern County lawmaker off a special committee considering a $2.9 billion rescue plan for financially ailing Southern California Edison Co. because he says he probably will vote against the plan.

 Apologies, but any chance of doing it before noon central, or after 4 pm centra.? 
 Great.  Look forward to the call. 
 Will get back to you. 
 Late last evening the Assembly committee passed its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78). Despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and/or eliminate the DA provisions in the bill, the bill passed with the DA provisions intact. The DA provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously (see previous note attached). The Assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the Appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee. When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly. If it makes it out of the full Assembly, it will then go to the Senate for approval, where the leader of the Senate, John Burton, continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the Senate are slim. On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week. The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1. In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.  We'll continue to provide updates.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

The Edison deal was announced just a few days aft= er PG&E rejected Davis' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Bo= th utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the l= ast six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise reta= il rates.=20  Edison's -- or perhaps Bryson's -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling a= spect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed i= tself in receivership. Edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, ad= vertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legi= slature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to = do.=20  Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for Bryson? Or, as some s= uggest, does it stem from Edison's tardiness in erecting an impregnable fin= ancial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holdi= ng company, Edison International? Edison scrambled to build a fire wall aft= er bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as str= ong as PG&E's.=20  The dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equal= ly odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians= do what they do.

Why would Davis= put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition = that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the g= overnor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?=20  Harvey Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a "war room" nea= r the Capitol to fight the Edison scheme, believes that Davis' unusual effo= rts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall St= reet would blackball him if Edison follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.=20  Another possible explanation is Davis' decades-long relationship with Bryso= n. The two served together in former Gov.

 No problem.  Thanks for re-forwarding.  Best, Jeff 
 Apologies, forgot to mention that the "consumer" groups generally don't have a problem allowing Edison to pay off its debt to the QFs. 
 Mike: A few thoughts: Conference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive, and I'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with Edison. If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule. No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.  It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push. The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC. Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer). The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much "headroom" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements. Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective. All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate ("ORA") buy into the idea. I'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA. On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.  Some preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.  Best, Jeff 
 Severin:  Good talking to you.  Thanks for taking time out to have lunch with Federico.  I'll be accompanying him.  See you at around 11:45 on Friday.

 Getting a little concerned that Borenstein might be on vacation--haven't heard back yet.  Will let you know just as soon as I find out.  Best, Jeff 
 Don't want to leave you in the lurch, though. 
 i'll try to reschedule the dinner if i can. 
 nope.  will keep trying... 
 Can I distribute to the business groups? 
 My understanding is that we'll all try to attend. 
 agreed. 
 The California PUC Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR. In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.  The Legislature The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee. It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today. Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers): Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers. Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers. Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers. Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions. There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions. Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill. So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions. After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03. Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges. Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line. Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis. At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen. 
 will do. 
 Ditto. 
 FYI 
 Those would be the messages.  Short, sweet and to the point.  More info to follow. Best, Jeff 
 The pressure on the PUC is getting strong.  Could be a move by Davis' office to get folks to support the Assembly bill as a preferrable alternative to the July 1 date now included in the PUC draft.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  In case you hadn't seen it.  Interestingly, no mention of the transfer of the gas assets. Best, Jeff PG&E restructuring bid draws state ire By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writers (Published Sept. 21, 2001)  In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state "bailout." Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC "has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer," Davis told reporters Thursday. "The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment." The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. "I don't think the judge is going to do it," said PUC President Loretta Lynch. Consumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. "It's complete piracy," said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco. "It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen." Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. That would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California Edison. PG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials. "Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws," said influential state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- "the lower end" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. But that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. And Gary Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. "This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with," Cohen said. Despite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a "yes" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. Glynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, Glynn insisted. "From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless," he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. The PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with Davis for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't "asking the state for a bailout or a rescue" -- a jab at Davis' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison. It's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on Edison's attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Edison's creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan, might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. The PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. The utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. Despite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman Ron Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. Glynn said he's had "in-depth discussions" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. Also, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. If state officials fight the plan, "the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' " Bodek said. "Here's a plan that does that." The plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said Paul Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. "There's some credibility here, and it works," Aronzon said of the plan. Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall 
 I just got it.  I'll fax it.  Trying to read, but am currently reading the latest version of SB 78, which we just got and Scott has faxed.  Jim, here's the latest.  It's going to be heard this afternoon, per Scott's note.  It is not clear whether 1) it's going to make it through the Legislature, and 2) if it does make it through, whether Davis will sign.  It's very tied up with/linked to the other measures (Edison bailout, etc.).  Am trying to get more info, but that's it at this point.  Will report back on what happens at the hearing on the bill.

 Sue's back today.  She and I can get info for you today.  Best, Jeff 
 Apologies for missing the call yesterday.  As I'm sure you're aware, yesterday the PUC voted to suspend electric direct acces in California.  As a result, it was an extremely hectic day.  I do intend to make the weekly calls.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey, when do regional directors begin reporting to Steffes?  Any sense of the reasoning behing the org change?

 That's exactly right.  But I would say that Loretta, not Brown, was the winner, and will continue to be the winner.  Best, Jeff  PS Can you give a call when you get a minute at 415.782.7822?  Thanks. 
 FYI.  QFs meeting with Edison today.  Edison has not yet offered information on 1) date certain when QFs will be paid what they're owed, or 2) when the 5.37 cents will kick in.  Best, Jeff 
 Mike:  Does that legislation that passed a couple of years ago(?) that gives the Governor the power to appoint the PUC president also give the Senate advise and consent rights on the appointment of the president?  I don't recall that it gave the Senate advise and consent rights, but sure would be interesting if it does.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 An SVP from Edison just informed us that Edison will be sending out by email information on DASR acceptance/rejection. He said that all DASRs submitted prior to midnight on 9.20.01 will be accepted, irrespective of whether Edison subsequently rejected them for inadequate information, adminstrative or other reasons. He said that they will also be asking ESPs to provided a list of all contracts executed prior to midnight 9.20.01 and for which DASRs have not yet been submitted. When the DASRs for those contracts are submitted, he said that Edison will accept them, so long as they track the list previously submitted. I asked if Edison would be lobbying to have the Commission issue a subsequent decision clawing the suspension date back to July 1. He said he didn't believe they intended to do that, but he said that they did intend to lobby the Commission to make sure that newly-minted DA customers don't escape any costs they're responsible for.  Please forward this along to anyone else who might need the information.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Sure you've seen it, but just in case.  Non-energy-related friend of mine emailed it to me.

SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest at Enron  By Stephen Taub  The Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provide information regarding certain related party transactions.  "We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in a prepared statement. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC."  Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of and approved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," Lay added.  As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profits from transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of deals with Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.   REPORT: E&Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVED Later this week, Ernst & Young will announce that its revenue growth was nearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Financial Times.  Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenues rose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenues climbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year.  The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&Y fetches most of its business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in the first half of this year.  "We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a period of great challenge and change in our profession," chairman James Turley told the FT.  Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this year through August 31.  Another reason for E&Y's revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firm is expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in local currency terms, according to the paper.  Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term and are instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debt covenant issues, and security concerns. "We're going to see more covenant violations and that will drive restructuring issues," Turley told the FT.  Read On!

 Hey, man, how'd the dinner go?  You get everything squared away with the Legislator?  Best, Jeff 
 Eldon called me this morning informing me that it's their anniversary this weekend. As such, I sort of tossed any other plans out the window and told him that we'd definitely be around.  As such, I was wondering if you guys planned to do the same, and if so, (following up on your note Scott), it would be totally fucking cool to play golf Sunday morning (particularly since I have not desire to sit around a and watch football).  You guys up for golf?  You plan on doing the anniversary thing?  Best, Jeff  PS Where's my email Ms Perfect? 
 didn't listen to all of it, but sounds like they ain't making a heckuvalot of progress with edision on getting paid or getting the 5.37 cents put in place. 
 The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes. We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order. Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things. The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).  Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much.

 Being a patent maven and auction babe, thought you might find interest in this.  Best, Jeff  Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2) 2001-09-21 16:39 (New York)  Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2)  (Adds company comment in seventh paragraph.)  Marshall, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in a lawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronic trading system.  Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction Source LLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May 2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller Specified Exchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.''  Houston-based Enron and its EnronOnline unit are improperly using that patented technology through its Internet-based electronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept. 17 in federal court in Marshall, Texas. Enron trades commodities such as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.  Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking Enron from infringing the patent, and is asking for damages.  EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas in November 1999. Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it's handled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685 billion, the company has said.  Enron, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal, paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million on revenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.  ``We have not reviewed the suit, so we can't comment on it,'' said Enron spokesman Vance Meyer.  Shares of Enron fell 9 cents to $28.30 today. 
 Could we get a copy of the letters referenced in the story?  415.782.7854. 
 Thanks alot. 
 Seems like something IEP would certaintly be way out in front on. After suppliers' last experience with the PUC's planning process, seems like they'd aggressively go after its return in a very big way. 
 The generators are going to go nuts over this.  They'll do all the pounding needed on their own.  Calpine will likely lead the charge, which should be interesting.... 
 thanks. 
 Michael Tribolet and I are scheduled to meet with Fielder on Monday, Oct 1. at 10 AM to test the waters for a possible settlement of our PX credit claim with Edison. If the Governor calls a special session to begin Oct 1, I'd guess that Edison will try to delay the meeting.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  You taking the course?  It looks very good to me and I've added it.  If you're taking it, could you let me know what the assignment is for Tuesday?  I'm on vacation, and the course hasn't yet been added to my Izio account.  Best, Jeff 
 o lord, there's not some reason that we'll need to go to Napa next weekend that I don't know about, it there? Just you guys going up to visit, right? 
 thank you. 
 The call was pretty tough. Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement . At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it. As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of the undercollection. Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years). In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back. Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection). We had a very "animated" discussion that went back and forth for some time. I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track. Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid. Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our "share" of the undercollection. We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.  If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Martin may be interested.  Best, Jeff 
 Well, we had the right person handling the call, that's for sure.  Best, Jeff 
 why did we agree to give Rod Wright $20K?      Hey, we kid!  Where'd we be without our humor?  Have a great weekend; thanks for taking the time to talk today.  Best, Jeff  PS What was that package again? 
 Looks good. 
 Under the circumstances, I am leaning toward cancelling (I was originally only going to participate on Monday anyway, and Sue hadn't planned on attending. Neither Rick nor Jim can attend.)  If there's a compelling reason that you think I should attend, let me know.  Otherwise I'll let Bev know that we'll take a rain check on this one.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Severin:  No, I'm not writing inquiring about employment as a research analyst (despite Enron's woes, which I'm sure you've been reading about).  However, my fiancee, Prentice Sellers, who got her MBA from Haas last May, is actively looking for work at an interesting place.  I wanted to let you know that she has applied for a position at the consulting firm that you're affiliated with.  Forgive the less-than-objective plug, but she's extremely bright and talented and did very well at Haas. Prior to attending Haas, she worked at LECG, where she was highly praised for her work and consistently got rave reviews.  She'd be a valuable asset to the firm and is worth giving a serious look.  Thanks for reading this paid advertisment.  On another note, I thought the Hoover conference was extremely good.  You and Sweeney did a great job.  What was your impression?  I've noticed that it got some decent press.  Best, Jeff 
 It was good to see you.  No thanks needed.  I'm pretty sure that I can get you the info on the plants--it's in the contracts and I'm fairly certain that we have that analysis.  How'd the meeting with PG&E go?  You get back to Houston OK?  Best, Jeff 
 I'll get back to you on teh plants as soon as I can.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 Groovy. 
 what's the name of the borenstein consulting firm that you're applying too? 
  Professor: Thanks for the response.  However, I sent you a copy with a few egregious typos.  Since it is still October 31, I hope you'll discard that copy and replace it with this one, which I think is now typo-free.  My apologies for the mix-up and thanks for your consideration.  You'll note that this copy is dated "1031,"  whereas the previous copy was dated "1029."  Best, Jeff 
 Best of luck.  Stay in touch.  You thinking of working in France? 
 you forgot "he's SO bright."  and I forgot "personal friend."  thanks for t= he laugh.  by the way, I'll be in houston all next week cozying up to important people= .... 
  PLEASE do not overreact, but I want you to have this information.  Hang in there everyone.  Jeff

 Hey, how ya doing? 
 Thanks, ain't going near it.  How's things going out there on your end--settling down at all?  Best, Jeff 
 Got the fax.  Thank you. 
 I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS.  As far as I know, Peace can't force CalPERS to do anything, including file a shareholder suit.  Therefore, I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding, or taking other action.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 I'm not positive.  The best way to find out is to call the Public Advisor at the PUC directly.  He'll be happy to fill you in on how to get on the list of speakers.  And I'm sure it's very easy to do.  I'll definitely give you a heads up regarding the Wednesday calls, though they've really wound down alot since the Legislature took off for vacation.  Hope all is well.  Best to you and yours, Jeff 
 Good plan. 
 Thanks.  Anyone there you would recommend as a point of contact/entry?  Best, Jeff 
 This won't work.  Try again, please.   KIDDING!  Looks great.  Thanks.  I'll forward along to Greg and Brad and get back to you soon as I know something.  Toodles, Jeff 
 Got your message.  As soon as I get a hold of Williams--not sure where he is--we'll have the call.  Hopefully we can do it within the next 30 minutes or so. That work for you?  And when it happens, I can conference folks in using my phone.  What's your direct dial.  Best, Jeff  P.S. Sanity is a good thing. 
 Thanks.  Talk to you soon. 
 Thanks very much for helping Aida. 
 Bob's secretary called to tell me that Bob's at a doctor's appt and will be back in the office around noon Houston time.  We'll shoot for around noon CST to have the call.  I'll conference folks in from my phone.  Best, Jeff 
 We need to start figuring out as soon as possible: What we want to accomplish at the hearing. What our posture/message will be. What to expect from the judge/commissioner and if and how we want to respond. What to expect from others and if and how we want to be prepared to respond. How to coordinate with other parties prior to the prehearing conference. How to ensure we're well coordinated with our other efforts (e.g., PG&E bankruptcy and Edison negotiations)  Sue and I can take the call from this end, and presumably Mike and Jeanne you can team up in a room on your end, so we can conference everyone in using our phones.  Please let me know if this works for everyone.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  That's why I was calling.  I'll continue to work to set up.  Any particular time, day, etc.? 
 Also, GWF is a QF developper from back in the days when QFs roamed the earth. Rather small player at that as best as we can tell. 
 USA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study. NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade, regardless of whether the market is deregulated, a federal study said. But there's a catch. While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer. According to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices. Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources. "Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace," said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study. Swezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories. The study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products. "If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack," said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study. CALIFORNIA CAVEAT Green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California . But in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims. "The California experience shows that the transition to competitive retail power markets will not be smooth," Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner. More than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized. Non-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States. Hydropower provides about 10 percent. With the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute, technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, of Berkeley, California , is a scientific research center managed by the University of California .

 OK. 
 ?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim. ?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell: 1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC; 3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH. 5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment. ?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options. ?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal. ?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC. ?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on. ?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).  If you have any questions, let us know.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Ms Kahl:  Few things:  1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's current financial "challenges." 2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me? 3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its "undercollection" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison 	accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.  One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?  Inquiring minds want to know.  Hope you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges.  Best, Jeff 
 Still working on the large customers...Will let you know (but don't hold your breath). 
 yes. 
 Greetings Janelle:  Got your message. I will call you first think Monday to discuss.  Best, Jeff

  Well, it was too brief, and I didn't get to work with you nearly as much as I'd hoped. But when I did, it was very enjoyable.  All the best.  These are strange and unsettling days, but it seems that the best among us always land on their feet, so I'm sure that's where you'll end up.  Take care and hope to cross paths again soon.  Best, Jeff 
 thanks for the tip.  maybe i'll run into you on my way to the top....  seriously, have a great weekend.  i'll be studying.  Best, Jeff 
 It was good to see you.  Glad you had a good time. 
 Does it make sense to have a quick call (15-30 minutes) just to update you on the status of Edison/PG&E talks, what's going on at the PUC, etc.?  Let me know.  Today looks pretty good for me to try to do it.  Best, Jeff 
 Talked to Craver's office. His office is going to get back to me about meeting at Edison early next week.  That work for you?  Best, Jeff 
 We continue to trade voicemails.  One of these times, we'll catch each other.  I'll report back just as soon as we do.  Best, Jeff 
 will do. 
 O boy, I feel another planting binge coming on!  Hey, we're likely going to the Dome this weekend, so you're likely going to have put with seeing us.  Could you believe that game last night--got to be one of the best world series ever. 
 Traded calls.  I'll get back to you soon as we hook up.  Can't wait to hear what Jerry says.  Probably something like, "Talked to Tom Beach.  Heard about your plan.  We'll call you."  Or who knows.  He could surprise us.  I'll let you know either way.  Best, Jeff 
 We're currently scheduled to follow-up with Edison at Noon CST (10 AM PST) on Thursday, Nov. 8th.  We'll set up a number and distribute to folks.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for your efforts, thanks for trying, and thanks for your strong sense of decency.  If there's anything whatsoever I can do to assist, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff 
 Ah ha.  Now I see why you were asking.  So sorry that you "have to visit" Maui.  Tough break. 
 thanks. 
 Thanks a million. 
 thanks. 
 FYI. 
 eeegads.  you heard about the story circulating that skilling attended a "high society" pajama party last weekend in houston. eeks. 
 Interesting thanks.  Any word on the transcript? 
 Could you forward Dan's draft.  While Aaron's points are good ones, I think may tipping at windmills... 
 you'd think he'd go abroad on vacation or something until things cooled down, non? 
 Thanks, Jeanne.  Just to be clear (since we had a bit of a different take last Friday in the meeting that Jim and Sue and I had with Mike).  Mike's take was that we'd be addressing just about everything under the sun, including why we think that hearings are necessary.  This takes a much narrower approach.  Just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.  I understand that Mike was travelling yesterday and the first part of today.  Likely makes sense to have a call this PM to make sure out ducks are all in a line.  Thanks again.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Any chance of changing my lesson from tomorrow to this Friday (preferably about lunchtime)?  Let me know.  If you're all booked for Friday, I'm likely going to have to skip this week.  Let me know.  Hope all is well.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  I've talked to Jeanne, and she and Mike may have not completely communicated on this.  Given the uncertainty, I'm having to hold off on sending a note around.  I'll do one after the call.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Could be pretty explosive if evidence turns up confirming the market'= s suspicions. =20 Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the note.  Just let me know.  We'll do it when you're ready.  Between now and then, could you send me a summary (understanding that it's an estimate) of time and materials as you see them.  Thanks again.  Good luck with the other jobs.  Talk to you soon.  Best, Jeff 
 Great.  Can you give me the entire list (indicating who's who)?  I'm thinking that if I let the big customers know, perhaps that'll give them an incentive to sign on. 
 Couple thoughts.  Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.  Seems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is. Assuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the Edison view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers. It would help alot if PG&E took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection. In a proceeding where Edison and PG&E are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better. But it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PG&E agrees to take our side at the PUC). But if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PG&E were amenable, there might be some real value.  Again, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.  We can take it or leave it.  Best, Jeff 
 In California, all customers can choose--large and small.  There are core (small customer) and noncore (industrial customers).  Consumption volume differentiates the two.  Noncore customes receive cheaper transporation rates.I'm not sure what sort of limitations you're specifically focused on.  There are requirements regarding storage requirements (customers must have some storage) and requirements to pay a share of past "stranded costs" caused by the move to competition.  And noncore customers on PG&E have more flexibility to buy in-state transportation than customers on SoCal have.  If there's anything else, let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 What came of the call? 
 You get in to see Whalley? 
 Wow, based on the share price, it appears they're having significant difficulty finding additional sources of funds.  Ain't getting any prettier. 
 you get in to see whalley? 
 You're kidding, right?  Edison's at about 14.50. 
 great.  good luck with others. 
 FYI. =20 Thought folks might be interested in the following story. =20 In addition, I've attached at the end for those that are interested a CSFB = report on PG&E's POR announced yesterday. Very much enjoyed working with this group on a solution for California.

 When do you want to call Hedy and Bev? 
 $18.10/share.  don't make me give suggestions. 
 aye aye. 
 thanks.  I think "hump day" is putting it mildly.  You see in the press that we approached (are still approaching?) KKR?  And that Buffet ain't interested?  What a world.  Someone in real estate finance I know compared what Fastow & Co. did to the FirstPlus fiasco.  That hurt.  Best, Jeff 
 Quick adder:  It appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments, which is no surprise.  Utilities position is obviously extreme but it means there's likely to be a signficant fight over the issue. 
 No problem.  To be honest, I was concerned--given how wide-ranging it was--that I might step in something unintentionally.  Please let me know if I do/did.  Also, keep in touch with how the issues go with them, since they are clearly trying to use the reg. issues as leverage, and in that regard, often offering up worst-case scenarios.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll get back to you today.  Houston is dealing with some pretty big issues, but I'm going to push them to meet with you nonetheless.  How's the weather in the big apple?  You vote for Green or Bloomberg? 
 OK, today's been nuts.  This is likely not complete, but wanted to get something around. Please review for 1) anything I've missed and/or 2) anything I've misstated.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff

 No problem.  I'll let them know.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey: Just heard back from Brad.  He's not cancelling.  Just post-poning.  Lots--and I mean lots--going on.  I think that, realistically, we're talking December.  Sorry about that, but you know how quickly things can change....You guys hang out with the McCourey's at all?  Kisses, Jeff 
 Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:  The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension. With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees. The utilities said that hearings could be held "sometime later" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward. A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings. There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference. The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th. The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday. In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues. At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings. Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.) The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues). Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight. Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity. Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection. The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no. As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue. The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., "why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info," etc. From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized. In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in "serious negotitations." 
 interesting to say the least.  great case for b-school.  you still in texas? 
 No new details to report.  Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings folks.  The folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on.  They understand (as do we) that the likelihood of prevailing is slim, but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current DA status and to attempt to preserve it going forward.  (DA seems to need all the help it can muster given that Karl Wood and Bob Barnett appear to have control of the issue at the PUC.) Could you let me know either way if you'll sign on.  Dorothy, talked to Keith yesterday, who said you'd be making the call on this one.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 You bet. 
 gracias. 
 April:  Could you please distribute this to the office?  Thanks a bunch.  Greetings Folks:  Tired of thinking about related-party transactions, SEC probes and re-stated earnings?  Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Indicates where CMTA is on key bills working their way through California's wacked out Legislature.  Best, Jeff

 Yesterday, Riordan kicked things off in California.  He focused squarely on energy.  He made three key, and interesting points.  The contracts Davis signed are a huge mistake for California that must be fixed. If elected, Riordan would immediately eliminate Davis' Public Power Authority. If elected, Riordan would have California join a west-wide RTO.  I'll try to rustle-up some press accounts of his remarks.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey, buddie.  Mike and Sue still differ.  We're getting the transcript to verify.  I told them both that this is not something we should make a big issue out of since what the judge said in a "quip" from the bench will in no way alter our strategy or tactics.  They both agreed.  Soon as we get the transcript, we'll fill you in.  Let me know if this works for you.  (Please be easy with Sue, she's pretty tense.)  Best, Jeff 
 They're yours.  Just let me know as soon as you can if you'd like them.  Hope you're doing well.  Stay buckled up.  It's bumpy out there.  But at least they're starting to publicly clean house.  Best, Jeff 
 Haven't seen any DA statements yet.

 As we anticipated, today's call did not advance the ball from where we left off last week with Edison. Edison is sticking to its guns, claiming that all customers, DA and bundled alike, should pay for Edison's undercollection, i.e., they don't owe us money, we owe them money. The call was short and ended with an agreement that: 1) we'll both continue plodding along in the PUC process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues, 2) we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will 	be made, and 3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time Edison starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together 	to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.  If anyone has any questions, just let us know.  Best, Jeff 
 Rick: It's hard to articulate, so I'll just say that you're doing a phenomenal job.  Whatever happens, you have an incredible amount to proud of, not the least of which is how you've handled things during these very tough times.  Please remember that there's alot of folks out there that appreciate what you're doing and care about you alot.  And then there's your family, which is the most important thing.  Thanks again for your efforts.  Talk to you soon.  Keep hanging in there.  Best, Jeff 
 No.  what do they do? 
 great time.  SO sorry I passed out.  Man, I just suddently hit the wall.  On the Jay thing.  There's no pressure at all.  If you guys are uncertain, that's no problem.  Just need you to understand that I'm moving ahead.  Most importantly in the near term.  Are you guys hip on sharing the cost of getting appraisals?  Just let me know.  And again, let's keep this light.  No frictions.  Everyone needs to feel comfortable with where they are, etc. etc. etc.  Worse thing in the world is to let biz/finances get in the way of friendships.  Keep your taht moh rising.

 Hi Josh: Sorry to bother you.  But just wanted to be certain.  By my tally, I only need to take 3 units next semester (spring) to graduate (I'm taking 7 units this semester). Is there anyway to get that "officially" verified through the office?  Thanks much.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey darlin'.  You on this list, too.  Crazy, non?  Well, what isn't crazy these days?  Hope you're OK. 
 Well, that's not helpful. Won't make things any easier.  Are they an ARM member?  I'll let the large customer groups know.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  I'm assuming that we're still on for the call.  Let me know.  Hope things have calmed down somewhat since the deal was announced on Friday.  Best, Jeff 
 Rick:  With everything else going on, I apologize for raising this issue, but I'm concerned that if I don't, it may fall through the cracks.  I just realized over the weekend that within the next few weeks, I will have paid the full balance on tuition for the Fall 2001 semester in Berkeley's MBA program that I've been in since 1999.  (By the end of this semester, I will have finished 37 of the 40 units that are required to complete the program).  Naturally, I'd like to get reimbursed for the Fall semester's tuition, but I'm concerned that recent events create uncertainty at just about every level of the company.  I know you've got a hell of alot on your plate right now, so there's no need to discuss immediately.  I simply wanted to get it on the radar screen.  Whenever you get a free minute, give me a ring and we can talk about it further. Take care, and thanks for listening.  Best, Jeff  PS Given DYN and ENE share prices today, looks like the market loves the combination.  That's pretty nice.  (Wouldn't know it by what Rebecca Smith keeps writing, though.  Gives the impression that she won't be content until we're reduced to ashes--shame.) 
   FYI.  Edison has been successful at peeling off one of the ESPs--New West.  Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection. I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.  The salient quote in New West's "supplemental" PHC statement reads:  "It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission."  Obviously, not a helpful statement.  New West's supplemental PHC statement is attached.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  Could you re-email the ARM press release re: supreme court?  I want to distribute it around a bit.  Thanks. 
 FYI.  I notified the large customers and it appears they've taken it upon themselves to notify some of New West's customers of New West's new, "supplemental" position. 
 You think I should submit the reimbursement now, before the semester ends, just to get it in the door?  They should reserve a place for Fessler at the same place Davis deserves to go--history's trash heap.  You know that Fessler works with Klauberg, right?  Some people you just can't get rid of....  Best, Jeff 
 I'm assuming that these are the sorts of things we should hold off on? 
 Thanks.  Good luck.  Should be interesting. =20 Best, Jeff 
 This is very sad.  Prentice (now one of PWC's finest) and I talked and here's where I come out.  I love Annie and want to remember her the way she is.  And I bet she would feel the same way.  All the chemo gets her is a little more time, and who knows how long, and the quality of extended life is likely to be very low.  It's really hard, but I think that the best thing for Annie, and everyone else, is for Annie to go to sleep, peacefully and quietly.  I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to pass on the 6 o'clock phone call.  I hope you understand.  I'll be at your place on Thursday to see her.  Best, Jeff 
 will do. 
 do you have rory's email address? 
 Hi Avram.  Meet Rory, Prentice's brother and computer guru-type.  Rory and I talked a little bit about what you're looking for, so I thought I'd just go ahead and facilitate a little chat room here.  Avram, could you explain one more time to Rory exactly what it is that you're looking for, just to make sure that I've accurately and adequately described the situation?  Rory has some ideas.  Best, Jeff 
 Thought I'd add Eldon, too, since he likely has some ideas and information, too. 
 Hi:  Sorry to bug you--know things are crazy--but just checking in on the presentations we talked about yesterday.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes. Hadn't planned on going. 
 talked to roger again.  give me a call when you get a chance.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you. Will there be a call-in number?  And who else do we expect on the call? 
 i'm here. 415.782.7822. jeff 
 Will do.  Won't have it expand beyond that, unless Belden, Vicki or Janet specifically want someone else.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm at my desk.  Jeff 
 He got me.  Thanks.

 where's this leave mcmahon? 
 Thanks a million for your help on this.  On first glance, these look great.  I'll give you a ring tomorrow to discuss further.  Best, Jeff 
 No problem.  Man, for someone who doesn't know much, you sure know alot, based on the note you sent.  It's your call on today's lesson.  If you're feeling under the weather, then we can pass for today.  Otherwise, I'll show up at 4:30.  Just let me know.  And you can decide anytime between now and 3:30.  I don't know how much Eldon and Rory can help, but they're both real knowledgeable and generally love thinking about this kind of stuff.  Best, Jeff 
 Who loves ya baby?  Hey, don't say anything to Karen, or her parents, but I'd like to get something for her parents as a thank you for Gloucester.  What sorts of things do they like?  You heard that Prentice got a job offer from Price Waterhouse?!  See you on Friday!  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings folks:  We will temporarily suspend the Wednesday, 11:30 AM call until things settle down a bit.  If something crops up, we can set up a call to discuss.  In the meantime, we'll be communicating regularly outside the call.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks again for the stuff.  I can take it from here.  Two quick questions. 1) Is there anything that's top secret that I shouldn't be talking about? 2) Do we have anything for LNG activity similar to the slides on incremental interstate pipeline capacity?  Thanks again.  I'll let you know if anything interesting comes up.  Best, Jeff 
 Centrica's gain.  Enron's loss.  The very best of luck to you.  It certainl= y has been a pleasure and I hope our paths cross again soon.  All the best, Jeff 
 i'm back. 415.782.7822.  jeff 
 Thanks alot. 
 Hi Evie: As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing  The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.  At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.  I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?  Best, Jeff 
 plz call me when you get a minute.  thx, jeff 
 Dan:  I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop.  The project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR. The deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).  Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR. For the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete. By contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months. In short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well. We are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility. Therefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a "special case" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.  Thanks for listening. Let me know what you think.  Best, Jeff 
 If we do it Sunday morning, I'm game. 
 Thanks very much. 
 Thanks. 
 Yeah, I found this out last night as was going to tell you about it. 
 Thanks so much.  That sounds great.  What day of week is the 7th? 
 I recommend that we just stick to one of the three that Joseph originally to the time and effort to select.  Any chance of salvaging any of those?  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Left you a voicemail over the weekend.  Was traveling Thurs/Fri, but got a chance to look at your reorg memo, and listened in on the call on Friday.  I've got a few questions.  You have 15-20 minutes today to discuss a bit?  Greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 when you intend to make counter to PG&E?  10Q out yet? 
 Thanks.  I'm on the California 8:30 (pst) call till about 9:30.  Best, Jeff 
 Only one call.  It's at 1PM CST.  Call if there's anything else. Best,Jeff 
 This is pretty big stuff and moving pretty quickly.  Understanding that times are crazy, and that it's a holiday week, if we could nonetheless begin discussing tomorrow, or even late today, that would be very useful.  Best, Jeff 
 Not all, but some.  I'll give you a ring to discuss more. 
 Wow, there is a God.  Thanks.  Have a great weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you.  Pretty interesting. 
 thanks. 
 I thought you folks were involved in this program and supported it, but I may have it all wrong.  In any case, please see attached regarding utilities joint proposal on implementing the DA suspension.  Community Aggregation would not be allowed after Sept 20th.  Is anything you care about and/or have a position on?  Thanks very much. Hope you're well.  Best, Jeff 
 No problem.  Give me a little time and I'll get you some names.  What's your timeframe?  (Probably yesterday, right?)  Best, Jeff 
 Sorry.  Was covering a meeting up the street.  Got your message.  I'm back.  You know there are rumors flying around about you in London?  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Just wanted to check in to let you know that I've taken another step in getting meetings with the GM of both Anaheim and SMUD.  Will let you know.  Ain't moving at a lightening pace, but there's progress.  Best, Jeff 
 Jeanne:  Do you have a copy of the procurement OIR?  Could you email it to me if you do? Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 It's more complicated still.  A crazy commissioner at the CPUC now wants to require everyone to submit their DA contracts to Commission for review.  It's attached.  Folks are going to oppose it very strongly.  I'm available to talk.  I'm not sure that the Oct. 5th date has got legs.  Best, Jeff 
 My apologies for the delay.  About three other bonfires cropped up after I talked to you.  In any case, the answer to your question, is yes, we can switch our customers to dual billing if we choose to do so.  If you have any other questions, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 You're a helluva guy.  I'm damned proud to be associated with you, and hope= to continue in the future.  If we don't get a chance to talk between now a= nd tomorrow, have a great Thanksgiving.  And Rick, I'm not a very religious= guy, but god bless you.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Dan.  I'm having a very difficult time seeing how Enron will have a= ny choice other than to vigorously (and respectfully) 1) decline to offer u= p any contracts and 2) assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair to attem= pt to impose any quid pro quo, i.e., forcing folks to waive their due proce= ss rights by declining to hand contracts over to Karl. =20 Best, Jeff 
 you got it. 
 Very yummy dinner.  So light.  So fluffy.  Your friend Renee is very nice. Thanks. 
 dude:  you guys won first (even after those bad picks you made).  Congratz.  don't look over your shoulder, cuz we're right on your heels! 
 So sorry to hear about your nose.  How bad is it? Swollen?  Your eyes OK?  Expected to heal quickly? 
 Greetings Dan:  Few things.  Chris Warner did an extremely good job of talking about your plan at DJ's thing in Yountville. Thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit more "outside the box" to help on the Lodi power plant/gas storage deal.  Any indication of who that person might be? We're anxious to start meeting with them. Any word on getting a conference call together with the large customers? Finally, have you told the PUC yet that you won't be filing any stinking GRC?  If so, how have they reacted?  Have a great holiday weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 wouldn't miss it.  how's lil' annie doing? 
 "paid" is right.  jeff just keeps paying, and paying, and paying... 
 got your message and sorry i didn't get back to you.  wanted to thank you very much for taking the time on such short notice, and, from what I've heard from others, for having done an outstanding job.  Thanks again.  And yes, we'll take the victories when we can get them.  Best, Jeff 
 prentice's haas address is no longer valid.  you'll need to send to "psellers@pacbell.net." 
 Looks like the market ain't crazy about our 10Q. You get the go ahead from Whalley on PG&E? 
 how'd it go?  and how you doing? 
 i'm back in office. jeff 
 oo la la is right! 
 Hi.  I read Karl's ruling on the contracts.  Just about had it with that bozo.  I'm assuming that the customers are going to resist? 
 Hey man, you feeling any better? 
 what would you like me to bring and/or do for Friday? 
 Hello:  First, forget it all and have a wonderful holiday.  Second, given the immense challenges, I've been instructed to get major expenses in and paid.  So I sent to Rick in a confidential folder my tuition reimbursement form for school.  Do you know if he got it?  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much.  If possible, I'd like to listen in.  That possible? And have a very nice holiday.  Best, Jeff 
 test 
 test 
 Very quick and dirty--not even fully proofed.   But wanted to get something out for folks to shoot at.  Let me know your thoughts. Sure I've missed about a million things and mucked up about the same amount.  Happy Thanksgiving.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm in.  thanks so much.  Best, Jeff 
 Steve:  Here's our assessment of Wright's performance in California.  On the plus side: He is generally pro-business, and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth, e.g., he opposed the windfall profits, and related, bills. He sided with the California Assembly Republicans to craft an alternative to the "MOU" for Edison that included direct access as a core feature of any MOU. His decision to work with the Republicans helped move the political "center of gravity"--albeit marginally--more favorably toward direct access in California.  On the negative side: In each and every case that Rod has had to make a choice between the market, customers and competition on the one hand, and the utility on the other, he has never waivered in his decision--he always put the utility first. Here are three examples (and there are more): 1) 	During this extraordinary session, he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a "stranded cost charge" for utilities. 	Yet by most accounts, Californians have already paid off the utilties' stranded costs.  How many times must Californians pay? 	We worked with consumer and business 	groups to oppose the bill. 2)	In the "alternative MOU" that Rod worked on with Republicans, the Replicans told us that Rod insisted on suspending Direct 	Access until January 1, 2003--a demand that most believe originated with Edison. 3)	Rod sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and 	billing services.  Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and Rod remained 	unswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.  Hope this helps.  If you need any other information, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Here it is.  Apologies that it's very sketchy and barely proofed, but wanted to get something out to folks to shoot at.  Have a great holiday.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 PG&E called.  They want to set up a conference call to brief us on the gas piece of their POR that they'll be filing with FERC around November 30th.  They want to try to do it in the next couple of weeks. Please let me know if you're interested and please pass this along to anyone else who might be interested.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Lamar.  Geoff, could you let us know how it goes with the customer and if this a mix-up on the customer's end.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much. 
 Thanks so much for the call back.  Here it is.  It's got temperature and %RH from end of May to early November.  Couple of things.  I tried to keep and save heat days (cumulative) on the graph, but for some reason, it won't stick.  I'm assuming that you know how to add just about anything you want to the graph.  If not, let me know.  Also, the data should be cut off for about a week at both the front end and the back end (to account for the time that it was in my apartment prior to setting in up on the property, and before I was able to download it in November).  Once you get a chance to look at, give a call and let me know what you think.  If the temperature range looks like it's around the ballpark for vines, I'll want to get Terry Rosetti up to do some soil testing, but wanted to get your take on the temperature, etc. first.  Really appreciate all your help.  My number is 415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff 
 Sue: This woman from NewWest is driving me crazy.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: I just talked to Marcie.  She's interested, but wants some more info to examine before setting up a meeting.  Aren't there some press articles about the sort of muni partnerships you want to pursue with SMUD and Anaheim?  Do we have anything else that I can email to her to wet her whistle for the meeting?  Will get back to you very soon about meeting with Schori at SMUD.  Best, Jeff 
 I have one tomorrow (09.25.01) at 10 AM. 
 Plan of Reorganization. 
 Can you forward me both?  I'll take a look at them. Maybe they'll do the trick.  Also, do you have that press article where we partnered with a muni (in Canada, I think)? 
 This time with attachment... 
 Thanks?  Brown going to vote for it? 
 Greetings Ms Denne: Hope your holiday was restful and relaxing.  A week or so ago, there was an article in the clips about Enron partnering with a muni (in Canada maybe) to provide retail energy services for the munis retail customers.  Could someone in your shop try to dig that up?  I need to get it to a CEO of a California muni for EES and I'll be darned if I can't locate it!  Greatly appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Janelle: Here's an email and slightly modified PP presentation that I'd like to send to Marcie.  Let me know what you think.  Best, Jeff  *********************************************************************************************************************************  Hi Marcie:  Congratulations again on your new role at Anaheim.  Elena tells me that you're having a great time.  Thanks for taking the time to talk a little bit about the strategic alliances Enron is forming with public power.	We're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers.  I've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program.  In sum, the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers, using their own brand name.  Since EES retains and manages all price and product related risks, our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk.  Here are some of the program's highlights:  Enabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering, reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus.  Our alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name.  Our market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities  Our alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.  Products and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.  Innovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses.  Thanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday.  If you have any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822, and I'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful Southern California.  All the best, Jeff 
 and we ate more last night and we're still alive.  Thanks very much for your hospitality and a really fun time. 
 Thanks.  If we ever get out of this mess, you can rest assured that I'll help out.  Can you remind again right after the first of the year, at which time we should have a better idea of where this ship is heading?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 please review this one.  i just read the contract and there is no end date.  it's open-ended and simply says that we can end at our discretion. 
 Thanks very much for getting the contracts for me.  Please address one each to Bev and Hedy on our letter head so I can sign and send out today.  Thanks a bunch. 
 Scott: Here are the foundations that ARM will use in its appeal of the PUC decision suspending DA (and threats to make it retroactive to July 1).  You should feel free to share with the business folks but under the condition that they keep it confidential.  And of course, we'd be thrilled if they'd sign on.  If you have any questions, just holler. Best, Jeff  The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. The Decision's purported findings are not supported. The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding. 
 The ARM group is going back and forth on what they want to say in their filing on the specifics of the DA suspension (many parties with many interests).  There continues to be debates over the specifics.  Soon as there is a draft that folks have reasonably agreed to, I'll send it to you.  If you have any questions, give a holler.  Best, Jeff 
 No problem. 
 Apologies just got back.  Can't make the call, but concur that we ought to stay where we were.  Not that the proposal doesn't merit discussion, but it raises many issues and we're down to the wire.  So I concur with Bill and Aaron.  Perhaps we should try to regroup first thing in the AM?  Best, Jeff 
 did i ask you to fax copies of the hedy/bev letter to ginger?  signed, al   ziemer 
 gracias 
 Thanks, Geoff.  May make sense to loop back with the woman at the PUC who contacted Jim originally about this account. Jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a UC account.  Jim was out yesterday and today, but I think that he'll be in tomorrow.  He may want to make the contact.  Jim, thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 Will do.  Thanks again for getting to the bottom of it. 
 got that one covered too while you were out. 
 de nada 
 Sounds like were back at plan b. 
 You have a sense that the Alan departure was coming?  Too bad.  Nice, very capable guy.  Best, Jeff 
 that's neat.  please give them both my best. 
 call me.  thanks.  jeff 415.782.7822. 
 really sorry to bother you with this, but any idea of whether my tuition reimbursement has successfully made it's way through?  Thanks a million.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Looks like many are exploring.  Probably value in staying coordinate internally. I'll give Alan a call. Best, Jeff 
 Hey, just checking in to see if you're still out there.  What a story.  Hope you weathering things ok.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Well, it's about over for the company known as Enron.  Ultimately I, and just about everyone else, am going to need to find a new job.  But it should be viewed as an opportunity rather than something less positive.  It's a shame that such a fun, interesting and bright group of people that had a very successful core franchise are now in such a messy situation due to a handful of folks who exercised (at a minimum) extremely poor judgment.  But it is what it is.  As for me, I'm dusting off my resume and getting ready to send it around. I've already had a few calls from "inquiring minds," so we'll we where things end up.  Thanks so much for the thoughts. Definitely crazy times, but I'm not getting to worked up about it.  And besides, Prentice has accepted PWC's offer, so I'm looking forward to housekeeping!  Best, Jeff 
 Well, I think that Enron's fate is going to affect everyone, including me. But no worries, I'll land on my feet.  Love to have tea, just let me know when.  How you doing? 
 You're a good man.  Thanks.  You may regret having offered, though, since there's an extremely good chance that I'm likely to take you up on it. 
 OK, now I'm getting choked up.  Thanks, man. 
 FYI.  Thank you both very much for your help on this.  Best, Jeff 
 For this week, we'd like to cancel both the Tuesday and Thursday calls and instead reschedule to Wednesday at 9 AM PDT (11 AM CDT).   We'll try to use the same call-in number. Scott, could you let Ken know of the plan?  Please let me know if this change presents a problem for anyone.  Best, Jeff 
 call me re: ISO.  Jeff 415.782.7822. 
 boy, you really did save this stuff.  i don't know who the author is, but, man, what a wit! 
 shoot me a draft of the withdrawal before you send it in so i can say that i reviewed prior to submission.  thanks.  Jeff 
 u hear about ISO?  give a call.  jeff 415.782.7822 
 Thanks very much.  Really appreciate the help.  I'll submit them just as soon as I get them.  Have a nice weekend, despite it all.  Best, Jeff 
 You've really been nice about this.  Thanks very much.  Could I stay in SF and work for NEG?  And  people don't really hate me, do they?  (Kidding.)  I'll give Dan a call.  Have a great weekend.  Best, Jeff 
 A regulah laugh riot, that's what she is.  Prentice, you're the best birthday present I could ever have--even better than money.  xoxoxox 
 Thanks, and ditto, my friend.  You're a rare individual at the company.  An= d it shows.  Please be sure to spend a little time looking after yourself a= nd your loved ones, since you've been doing a great job spending so much ti= me caring and looking out for the rest of us.  Best, Jeff 
 should i stop working?  no big deal, really.  but don't want to continue, if it doesn't make sense.  thanks, jeff 
 Thank you so much for all you've done for Annie.  You know that I've really come to love that crazy dog, and it meant a lot that you and Eldon were always so caring.  She is truly a lovely dog and I'll miss her immensely, but it helps that everyone was so loving.  And I'm really sorry that I couldn't be there for her today, but the Enron thing is really a mess and I've got responsibilities on that front that I just can't pass off. Thanks again so much for everything.  Hugs, Jeff 
 Oops.  Yeah, Aleck.  Too bad.  Talked to Sue. She's fine with it.  Will call Pat shortly. 
 All the very best to you and yours.  See on 1400Smith.com.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm going to work the rest of the day from home--I will be working, though (it's just not easy to work from the office today, as you can imagine).  You can reach me by email and cell phone 415.505.6633.  Hang in there buddy.  Best, Jeff 
 Will do.  Computer just got back up! 
 Many thanks to Elizabeth and Margo for helping to get email working again.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll call you very soon. 
 what's "sheltercorp?" 
 my email's back up....................................for now.  Best, Jeff 
 call when you can.  thanks.  jeff 
 Perhaps, given Nancy's note, you didn't get my previous email saying that I'm back up (for now).  Greetings all.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  Could you keep Annie's leash(es) and collars? 
 Dude: You started searching for ski gear for Cameron yet?  Love to work on it together, if possible.  Maybe, if we're buying two sets of skis, boots, poles, we'll get a discount.  You still plan on getting that?  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  Last night, we were hanging out the the CEO of Cameron's company and it turns out that he's a recording freak with unbelievable equipment and he'd likely be willing to record a TRUE BLUE CD FOR FREE.  Give a call when you get a minute.  415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff 
 Where have you heard that?  And what is it saying?  PS I don't think that "To Welsh" is a politically correct term.  Best, Jeff 
 call when u can.  IOUs jointly filed w/PUC saying "no assignments."  Jeff 
 Greetings.  Please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly.  Here's the latest:  As you know, I'm finishing up my MBA at Berkelely (I'll have but one class left to take next semester!).  Finals/projects, etc. are all done/due, etc. next week, so as you can imagine it's very crazy. In addition, I (we) had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week, and the Enron thing's been nothing compared to that. (I'd ask, "what next?", but I'm afraid to ask.....) However, none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you, so I apologize. OK, back to Enron. It's a mess (surprise). I'm still with the company--not sure for how long, however.  At least through the end of the year, it appears. Sue and Joseph have left.  If you'd like their contact information, I'd be happy to provide it. We're trying to transfer our DA contracts to other ESPs, but the utilities, Carl Wood and some others want to make it difficult, if not impossible. Though difficult as it may seem to believe, I'm actually doing OK (engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff) and I do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon. This week's a little tough just because with school and "the mess," I'm a tad preoccupied. HOWEVER, your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.  Will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings:  First, thanks for the pizza.  Second, in line with the "role play" that you described in class and in the handout for the project, we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon, spreadsheets, reams of numbers, etc..  Given the end-of-semester work load, we, like everyone else, are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project.  Given the change, if you would like, we would be happy to "beef up" the presentation to include more numbers, jargon and other technical gems, though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well.  Whichever way you prefer is fine by us.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Joseph:  Good news!  Wallace decided last night that we don't have to do a write-up for project after all.  All we have to do is turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet.  I've written her an email, telling her that we followed directions closely on the presentation (i.e., very simply, no jargon, spreadsheets, lots of technical crap, etc.) and wanted to make sure that that would acceptably when we turn it in, or  if she expected some "beefing up."  I plant to spend a little time with my slides and the spreadsheet (though not much!), just to make a bit better.  I'll let you know how she responds.  Great job by all.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  Hey, I can't open this.  Hugs, Jeff 
 Thanks, very much Alan.  Hedy, Bev and Scott are still technically on board until the end of the month, but that's fairly "ceremonial," so to speak.  Let's do this.  I'll give Hedy a call and see if they'd be willing to attend and report back. In my view, given the circumstances, if they've got conflicts and can't make it, I'm not inclinded to push it.  Sound reasonable?  Best, Jeff 
 Paul: Thanks very much for the note.  For the moment, we do still intend to go ahead with the projects and will stay in very close contact with you should the situation change.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Best, Jeff 
   Here's where I left off:  At least 3 things that need to be included:  1. Port exercises prepay. 2. ABM sells lease (capital gains?). 3. Depreciation expense/benefit.  Take a peek and let me know what you think.  Kisses, Jeff 
 Got your message. Likely makes sense to also call Evie Elsesser and Dan Carroll.  Let me know if there's anything else.  Best, Jeff 
 Great.  You know this is a pure "lobbyist" meeting, right?  You may want to do by phone, if possible.  Your call. 
 Greetings Professor: I regret that I was unable to attend class last night.  Few items:  --I assume that you returned papers.  I will be on campus tomorrow and can pick it up then if you like.  Or if you'd prefer, you can drop it in my box in the student room at Haas (evening MBA boxes).  Or if you'd like to make some other arrangement, just let me know.  --I assume that our third paper is due by close-of-business on Wednesday, December 12.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's my take.  Alan's got an airplane ticket to go down and attend the lobbyist meeting.  From my perspective, there is very little value in that activity.  However, if Scott wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the "Estate" doesn't incur the cost of Alan traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.  But if Scott ain't interested, he ain't interested.  That's my take.  Best, Jeff 
 what's up? 
 Thanks Robert.  Sounds good. FYI.  Prentice and I are getting Haley the portable CD player. 
 Please forgive me for continuing with this, but ENA just told me that they talked to Jeremy about 90 minutes ago and they had the view that there was still some uncertainty regarding whether Hansen had been included in the 24 contracts.  I told them that I'd already spoken with you folks and that Hansen was on the list.  Let me know if I'm missing something here.  Again, apologize for keeping on about it.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much?  Does that mean that the Hansen contract would be sold as a stand-alone asset? 
 Thanks for getting in touch.  Yes, we can schedule.  Do you know who all would participate?  Best, Jeff 
 As soon as I get my grades (which I hope will be mid-late December), I'll send them to Ginger in the attempt to get tuition reimbursed.  But don't worry, I have extremely low expectations about the likelihood of getting reimbursed.  This plan make sense?  Best, Jeff 
 2:30-4:00 (CDT) 
 Thanks. 
 FYI. 
 thanks. 
 Had a long chat with UC that I'd like to pass along, and a couple of additional issues arose in the course of the talk that I'd also like to discuss.  Is it possible to talk for 15 minutes first thing in the morning.  Best, Jeff 
 so you guys want to come by P&C's before dinner at La Folie, or do just want to meet at the restaurant?  Be great if you could come by and have a glass of champagne first.  Best, Jeff 
 Ain't got it yet.  415.782.7854.  Thanks a million. 
 Greetings. You decide to have a call of the walking wounded today?  Best, Jeff 
 got the fax.  thanks. 
 Prentice left her phone with me, so if you need to get a hold of her, it's going to be a little tough till later on.  Jeff 
 Thanks. you do the same. 
 Could you please refresh my memory of the other person in the group who's working on California?  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks so much.  I'll email when faxed.  Best, Jeff 
 One other thing.  I just had coffee with a former business colleague.  She is preliminary stages of starting a new, private science and tech high school (in conjunction with Cathedral in SF--Episcopalian folks).  I told her that you would be a good person to talk to w.r.t. setting up board, staff, etc.  She's very interested. She is an extremely neat person who I think you would like a lot.  Are you interested in talking to her?  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings professor:  Should be coming over your fax machine any minute.  Have a very nice holiday and thanks for a very interesting, thought-provoking and challenging course.  Best, Jeff 
 we taking a break before starting with issues memo?  jeff 
 call continuing?  jeff 
 u find it?  bond is $25K.  reg is $1K.  jeff 
 Greetings.  I plan to turn the final in tomorrow.  But I have a quick question about homework number 4.  Is it possible to call you today to ask what I hope will be a 5 minute question?  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 You have just used your quota of exclamation points for the remainder of this year and for all of 2002.  It was very fun. 
 may have them sold.  $50 apiece? 
 So you're the one who gave me this cold.  Just wanted to let you know that I've been working on the resume (in between work and finals) and will try to have you a draft by end of this week, or next Monday.  Get better.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm in.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  My apologies, Melinda.  I will remember.  Bear with me.  Lots of new names associated with California these days.  Best, Jeff 
 Very sweet.  Thanks.  Well, I tried.  No taker on the tickets.  Looks like you'll have to give them to your Neanderthal friend.  Or what about Jack and dottie? 
 call me. jeff.  415.782.7822. 
 call me.  re: PUC inquiry.  looks like it will move fast--w/testimony.  jeff 
 Hey.  I'm still trying to get through school and now I've come down with a = cold, so I need to take a pass on tomorrow's lesson.  Any chance of coming = on Friday.  I don't know what shape I'll be in, but if there's an opening, = maybe I can make it. =20 Best, Jeff 
 I'd love tickets. but don't kill yourself over.  Get better--cold's not bad, but it's damned annoying. 
 The trust could not run deeper.  Just to clarify, we'll want to focus solely and exclusively on the registration.  We're not in arrears on the bond.....yet.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Sweet. Thanks. 
 Nancy:  Here is the final.  Couple things.  The short answers are in the word document.  The long answers  are in two separate excel files.  I used the spreadsheet that you gave us to do the last long answer (the Fannie Mae question).  You can find the answer in a tab titled "Long Answer--Question IIb" and it's highlighted by yellow background.  The data for the problem is in the "data" tab.  Thanks again for a fantastic course and hope to run into you in the near future.  All the best, Jeff 
 Here they are.  Please let me know that you've received them.  Joseph:  good luck including duration to the correct spreadsheet!  And thanks for sending them along to Nancy.  Let's talk and figure out a time to get together.  Best, Jeff 
 will do.  what's your fax number? 
 Thanks again for your gracious hospitality over the weekend and a very happy anniversary.  Eldon, you were particularly nice to let me win at just about everything we did.  How much do I owe you for me and Prentice for the golf?  Best, Jeff 
 can you please fax thing we were faxing yesterday to jeremy.  i'm much obliged. 
 Just talked to the PUC.  Seems that EES is up-to-date on its registration and it's only EEMC that's not current.  Wade will get the 1K to Jeanne Bennett, who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get.  HOWEVER, the PUC person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of EEMC's security bond that EEMC's security has been canceled.  She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.  She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info. Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?  We need to get info on that.  We should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the EES security bond hasn't also canceled.  Let me know if you have any questions,  and let me know what we find out about the bond, or if there's anything I can do to assist.  Thanks, Jeff 
 Thanks.  Hanging in there about as well as everyone is.  No worries on getting back to me.  Just wanted to keep folks in the loop.  Been in contact with the desk.  Best of luck with the transaction. Enjoy the time off.  Talk to you in a couple days.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm not sure, but I have a sneaking suspicion that all you folks are finished this semester.  Just wanted to say congratulations.  I'm finished with this semester after today, but have one--that's one--class to take next semester to finish.  Also, though I can't make the ski trip this weekend, I definitely plan on skiing a lot this winter (maybe I'll see you at Squaw Deepikah), so let's stay in touch on the ski front.  Happy Holidays to all.  And if anyone has any questions on creative off-balance sheet financing or or the ins-and-outs of bankruptcy, please feel free to get in touch.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Just checking in.  What's up? Hope all is OK, or at least as OK as it can be.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings. Long time, no talk.  Just wanted to check in, say hello.  Hope, given these wild times, that all is well with you and yours.  Best, Jeff 
 Calpine has cratered to 13.15 at last look.  50MM shares traded today.  This is starting to look like the dot-com implosion. 
 Appreciate it.  Thanks. 
 She's gotta be freaking.  Can you imagine going through this twice!? 
 Cool. Enjoy the travel. 
 For anyone who hasn't seen it already, attached is an electronic version of California's PUC's decision to suspend DA.  Also attached at the end of the order is a very strong dissent signed by Commissioners Bilas and Duque.  Best, Jeff 
 hey, call me.  jeff 
 Hi Sandy: Can you and John make a call on Friday with Portland to discuss our response to the PUC questions?  Best, Jeff 
 How in the world did you get Brown to vote for the NGS?!  Very impressive.  Also, couldn't believe it when I saw Frank Lindh in the news.  My heart goes out to him.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks. 
 Thanks for forwarding them along.  At some point this evening, I'll be done with the semester.  Hope you guys are done soon, too.  Congratulations for another semester down, and ONE to go.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Professor:  Attached is the final case for E278.  Could you confirm that you've received it?  Thanks for an interesting and stimulating course.  Have a great holiday and I hope that our paths cross sometime in the not-to-distant future.  All the best, Jeff 
 Gee, sure was nice of Andy Fastow to wish us all happy holidays.  You see the Lehrer News Hour spot on Enron last night?  Very ugly.  Sure seems like folks will be testifying before Congress (much) rather than later...Oh, and remind me to thank Anderson for their supportive comments--looks like a mud-fight is brewing.  Hope you're doing OK.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for dinner.  Very yummy. 
 Any way for me to get a hold of Scott? 
 Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:  One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.  We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner.  Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later.  DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run.  For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.     /s/ HENRY M. DUQUE				  /s/ RICHARD A. BILAS Henry M. Duque						Richard A. Bilas Commissioner					   Commissioner  September 20, 2001 
 you already looking to jump ship? 
 this represent a big shake up? 
 Greetings TJ:  Hope all is well with you and yours.  Two quick questions:  1) When can we expect to get our grades?  I have a tuition reimbursement "issue" and would like to get the grades ASAP.  Any idea?  Much appreciated.  2) Where do I go and how do I get there to uncover what classes I ended up getting in the bidding process.  Thanks for everything and have a great holiday.  Best, Jeff 
 None here. 
 Thanks. I'll take care of it.

 FYI. Sac Bee did a very big story recounting its version of how CA's electric market got upside down.  Cites Enron scheduling a large block of power over a "small" tx line as an indicator.  Also cites the dinner Davis had with generators leading up to the crisis, where, the paper says, the generators warned him, but Davis took the money and did nothing.  Best,  Jeff 
 FYI: On the call today with Jeremy Blachman & Co. today, we decided to the do the following:  Sue will make sure that EES legal (Mike Smith) reviews ARMs petition to modify the Commission's order suspending DA. Sue will send Jeremy a one-page summary of the petition and Jeremy will use it to solicit participation from Enron customers (i.e., see if any are willing to sign the petition). Jeff will work with Karen Denne to start drafting a couple of one-page letters that customers would sign and send to Legislators in the event Davis is successful in calling them back in October to work on energy matters.  Let us know if you have any questions.  Best, Jeff 
 u read it? 
 Will do.  Ain't got a chance to call him yet, but will do so by COB today.  Agree we need to get it nailed down, period. 
  FYI. 
 I was trembling.  I mean, it read like a chilling cold-war spy novel.  Can barely write.  I'm quivering all over.... 
 FYI. 
 That makes at least two of us!  Hope you're doing well.  We intend to continue to fight vigorously to re-instate direct access in California.  Hope we'll be able to work together to get choice back.  Best, Jeff

 Not surprising, but thought you might be interested.  I responded that letting go is a good thing.  Best, Jeff 
 Sent you guys a check yesterday for $120 for me and Prentice.  Let me know if that covers gold on Saturday.  Best, Jeff  Go Barry! 
 The person's name at Calpine is Jim Macias (he's a vice president there).  His number 408.995.5115.  Thanks again, Marchris.  How'd the conversation go?  If there's anything that I can do to help, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff 
 Anything interesting (particularly with respect to ISO market manipulation) come out of yesterday's meeting?  Best, Jeff 
 I'm starting to get concerned about this.  A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to Sue on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.  As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to "compete" with colleagues, Sue in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.  These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with Paul and Sue to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.  I care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.  And if Sue is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and Sue to discuss, if you think that would be useful.  Forgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with Sandi, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.  Talk to you at noon your time.  Best, Jeff 
 Not a problem.  Will call in about 30 minutes.  Best, Jeff 
 Dorothy, if you can get it to the DA Coalition that would be great.  I'm also sending to Delainey to distribute to the other biz folks.  Best, Jeff 
 Here it is.  If you could get it to all the usual suspects, that would be great.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm back from the doctor.  I'll just take the time against lunch (i.e., I'll work through lunch), so no need to worry about any time accounting.  If there's any issues with that approach, just let me know.  Thanks a bunch.  Best, Jeff 
 Talked to Pat Mason.  Give a call when you get a chance.  Jeff 
 I thought that you said it was $60/person? 
 I'll keep that in mind...

 Two things:  When Aleck said that he was leaving "effective immediately," does that mean one can't use email to send him a note to wish him well?  If that's the case, do we have a forwarding telephone number for him?  Also, just wanted to make sure you're aware that Calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts.  His concerns are two-fold:  Generally, he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation, since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with. And specifically, we're tied up with Allegheny (sp?).  I've told him that we don't like the contracts, that we're talking to folks about how bad they are, but we're "staying under radar" and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyone's contract rights. 
 Thanks. 
 Did I tell you that Fawcett left for greener pastures? 
 You saw my previous email? 
 Really appreciate it.  I'll be up there this weekend.  If you, or one of your guys, want to drop by, I think that we could pencil it out in about 30 minutes.  Let me know if that works for you.  And thanks again.  Really appreciate it.  Best, Jeff 
 See story below.  State completes history's largest municipal-bond sale California's treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in U.S. history Tuesday -- a $5.7 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the state's energy crisis. The sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record. And it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer Phil Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $12.5 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year. With the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy, there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year, leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002. The slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis, could force "Draconian" budget cuts, Angelides said. "We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003," he said, "and that was before the tragedy of Sept. 11." Now, if falling revenues are added to the "$6 billion hole, we'll have deficits akin to the early 1990s," Angelides said, noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services. Earlier this year, the state advanced $6.2 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. Repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $12.5 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission. The huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November. But the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities. With utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way, regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks, PUC President Loretta Lynch said Tuesday. This year, "we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year," partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast, she said. But Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action, he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002. Besides raising the budget concerns, that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment. "I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year," he said, citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action. Tuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes. The notes are fixtures on California's cash-flow landscape. In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings. No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus. But a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs. Besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes. Tuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers. "It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11," said Peter Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros. As senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms. "There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations," Taylor said. The level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion. That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent. The notes mature June 28, 2002. Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent. Had the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance "would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated." Even so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to "move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year." 
 Sue has informed me that since she has most recently drawn the short straw, I'm next in line for meetings with Brown.  I've asked Mike Day to set up a meeting with Brown, me and Mike to begin our efforts to rehabilitate Mr. Brown.  Best, Jeff 
 See what a good night sleep can do!  We'll set up the meeting and determine the attendance list. 
 If u and others are trying to get on CA call, pls call my line at 415.782.7822.  jeff 
 hmmm.  my understanding is that prentice has a full plate this weekend, but don't know her precise schedule, so I was going to the dome to meet with dottie's cousin and the apple tree guy, and try to make some more progress finishing the cabin. 
 I owe ya.  Thanks a million.  See you tomorrow nite.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  We'll report back with any additional information that we hear.  Reports are that Davis is expected to issue today whatever it is that he would issue to call the 3rd X session and call back the merry band of (probably very grumpy) legislators.  Best, Jeff 
 Just so we're clear.  To say that it would not be a problem for very large tranches of customers to leave the system as part of "community aggregation,"  and then say it WOULD be a problem for individual customers to do the same, is, well, ridiculous.  In short, if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go DA, then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers. Finally, we're checking, but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the PUC to permit DA under 9X, but suspend all other DA.  Very interesting.  Best, Jeff 
 Can you send the draft letter Tracy refers to re: letter to legislators? 
 thanks. 
 FYI.  ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER EDITORIAL: DAVIS HURTING STATE In an editorial, the Orange County Register blasts Gov. Gray Davis and his board picks for the California PUC, which, the paper asserts, have nullified the only good to come out of California's energy deregulation - consumer choice. With commentary from Lance Izumi, an electricity policy analyst at the Pacific Research Institute, the Register says a PUC policy that requires customers to buy power from their local utility company is forcing ratepayers to fund Davis's overpriced energy purchases. The negative impact on California businesses, some already in a slump, could force the state's economy into a recession and discourage businesses from relocating there, the editorial said. It's reminiscent of the 1990's when government policy caused an economic bust and state unemployment shot to 10% (Orange County Register via Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Sept. 25, http://www.ocregister.com ).

 Probing the 'palace coup' Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president. September 26, 2001 By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. "I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. "The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. "It was an emergency," Fishman said. "We had to take action.'' What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. "They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. "All hell broke loose.'' Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. "If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. The generators got their way. The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. "In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. "The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. "We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. "Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. "He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. "They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. "They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. "We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

 Greg: Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting).  Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from their shop that will be in Houston are:  Ian Sullivan SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product  Cameron Sellers VP, Business Development  They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.  I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.  I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.  From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.  The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.  Best, Jeff 
 We should determine whether we want to voice an opinion on this.  Seems there would be two issues  that might concern us:  1) bankruptcy and 2) effect on our book.  Might be useful to discuss briefly; perhaps first thing tomorrow morning.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 you got it.  thanks. 
 Sue: Just talked to the Chamber.  Add them to the petition for rehearing.  CMTA will be back to me soon.  If they don't sign it's only because they'll file separately, but I think they're likely to join ARM's.  Best, Jeff 
 The meeting will happen.  Will only be a matter of who attends.  I'll let you know what I hear back.  Good luck with everything else.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings Eve and Bill: This has been forwarded to Delainey and Dorothy.  It's originating with AreM.  Delainey's distributing to some, I'm distributing to others.  The Chamber's already agreed to join.  If we're to have any hope of a) maintaining DA and b) eliminating any chance of a retroactive date, seems that we'll need as many folks signing on as possible.  Please see attached.  We hope that you can join.  All the best, Jeff 
 now for that bad news.  call me.  415.782.7822. 
 Anything of note from the FERC/ISO/Generator meetings? 
 Could you check and see if the Roundtable would like to sign on?  Thanks al= ot.  Best, Jeff 
 Sounds like some pretty good movement.  Congratz. 
 This story reflects fairly well the debate underway regarding the DA suspension date. The Treasurer, Angelides, is taking a hard line.  We are working with others to get the date pushed back. California PUC staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to.  They have made inquiries to our customers, including UC/CSU. Best, Jeff State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com> Sunday, September 2, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/09/02/MN155174.DTL> Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. "I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said. State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. "The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. "Which one were we supposed to take seriously?" The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. "Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. "You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said. State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. "What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

 FYI.  Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.  Word on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC "study" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by "green Senators" to pass a "green only" DA bill.  In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.  The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.  We'll report back with news as we get it.  Best, Jeff 
 Riordan edges out Davis in Field Poll: A survey finds lingering damage from the governor's handling of the energy crisis. By Amy Chance Bee Political Editor (Published Sept. 26, 2001) Gov. Gray Davis survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted, but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him, a Field Poll released Tuesday found. The poll showed Davis narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, 45 percent to 42 percent. Riordan's strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to Davis from California's energy crisis were factors in the findings, said the poll's managing director, Mark DiCamillo. "It's an interesting situation for a sitting governor," he said. "It's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election, but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold. And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about, and that's the energy and the electricity crisis." In a hypothetical Republican primary, Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State Bill Jones, 46 percent to 19 percent. Businessman Bill Simon trailed with 5 percent of the vote, while 30 percent was undecided. The poll surveyed 1,003 Californians, including 722 registered voters, Sept. 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 3.2 percent. Davis political adviser Garry South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was "horribly misleading." "These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval," he said. "These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general." DiCamillo said he found it notable, however, that views of Davis' performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis. In May, at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts, voters said they disapproved of Davis' performance, 49 percent to 42 percent. In the latest survey, they continued to disapprove, 47 percent to 41 percent. Voters also said they were not inclined to re-elect Davis, 50 percent to 43 percent. "Now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded, yet the public's image of the governor has not changed," DiCamillo said. "He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May. "No matter what the political temper of the times internationally, there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race. This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating Davis, and it's still negative." DiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County, 47 percent to 43 percent. He said the survey showed similar results in May. Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate, and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins, making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state. Riordan adviser Dan Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for Davis. "It's clear from this poll result that the voters who know Dick Riordan best support him most," he said. "Unless Gray Davis plans on winning the Bay Area by a voice vote, there's no way he can get re-elected unless he turns L.A. County around in a very big way." South said Riordan, who held a nonpartisan office in Los Angeles, will fare far differently in a statewide partisan contest. And he recalled that then-Gov. Pete Wilson was trailing Democrat Kathleen Brown by 23 points as he prepared in 1993 for re-election. "We all know how that turned out," he said. "A sitting California governor hasn't been defeated for a second term since 1942." The Bee's Amy Chance can be reached at (916) 326-5535 or achance@sacbee.com <mailto:achance@sacbee.com>. 
 Thanks very much.  I knew he'd call you back.....  Best, Jeff 
 I'd like to fax you something that Edison sent in support of their argument that:  1) by virture of the PX credit framework, DA customers contributed to Edison's undercollection, and, 2) DA customers should therefore contribute to the recovery of the undercollection.  Could I get your fax numbers?  Would like to get your comments once you've reviewed the argument.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Just heard from Michael Rochman of SPURR/REMAC. He wants to sign on . 
 got it. 
 Sounds reasonable.  Let me know what time you can meet this weekend.  After noon on Saturday, and  anytime before 4 pm on Sunday works great for me.  Understanding that it's a T&M job, would you nonetheless be able to give a ballpark figure once we've spoken this weekend and you've had a chance to think about it?  Also, I've got some longer range plans (barn, house, etc.) for the property that I'd like to run by you, too, but that's longer off.  Really want to get the deck done before the rain starts.  Thanks again.  Best, Jeff 
 You should have it already.  Give me a call when you get a minute.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 I'll forward to them. 
 you should have this. i sent it out yesterday.  the scapegoating continues.... 
 Haven't heard anything about it, though Sue's been closer to these issues. 
 Congratulations and best of luck.  Hope you'll be able to hire someone to replace you, given your new responsibilities.  Big country to cover.  All the best, Jeff 
 For what it's worth, I concur with Mike.  Option 3 is the most prudent, and preferable, path.  Best, Jeff 
 talked to karen.  thought we'd do bolinas weekend after your b-day.  and we're around the weekend of your b-day, it's just that i've got class all day that saturday.  i think if karen's overly uncomfortable, we should just do the four of us.  we can always do dinner with david and nina.  how's things? 
 attachment? 
 babe, if they get back to me with a date that week, i think that you ought to just have the meeting, understanding that the meeting with execs may not have occured yet.  nevertheless, you'll have a darned good idea by that time whether its working well or it's a flop, non?  anywho, let's see what response i get back.  maybe they'll want to push back.  her hair looked really good (it was pretty all over the place previously).  now, with a few professional flourishes, she look even more gorgeous (if that's possible).  best, Jeff 
 meet for a drink after work? 
 FYI.   Don't think it's anything that raises any concerns, but since you're signing on, thought you might want to peruse.  Best, Jeff 
 couldn't agree more.  was just kidding. 
 Thank you. 
 you rock.  cleca signing on? 
 Really don't want to write anymore notes.  while he's a friend, and i've known him since he was a lowly VP, sending lots of emails to CEOs, even in a flat org. like enron, is, well, bad form.  let's see what happens.  just let ian know that there's a chance that the meeting might take place prior to the EES debrief.  The cooking thing is great.  The funniest thing is that Prentice has always said that she hates rice, and therefore risotto.  so i'm psyched. 
 yes, dear. 
 no.  what's your phone number. need to fill you in on some stuff.  best, Jeff 
 No kidding.  However, it's safe to say that all concerned believe that your comparably quality and well-equipped to fill his shoes.  Hope to see you on the golf course soon. 
 Slight correction.  If, in fact, they actually come back next week, we'll likely stay with Tues/Thur.  If they end up NOT coming back, we may cancel regular call altogether, and continue for rest-of-year on "as needed" basis.  But we're still figuring and will get back to you.  We'll know more when we know more about what the heck the legislature is going to do, or not do.  Best, Jeff 
 I asked scott and hedy to fill ken in on the change for this week.  looks like ball got dropped.  poor ken. 
 you're not billing by the word now are you?  :) 
 No problem.  Your sense that the commercial folks going to be OK with this approach? 
 Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when Davis will call back the California legislature to address the Edison MOU, here's the latest information we have. Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature. Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week. We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow. It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely. At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11. In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.  We'll report back with information as we get it.  Best, Jeff 
 I agree.  Sue, I'm willing to join Mike in a meeting with Bilas. Mike, can you set up a meeting for Wednesday morning?  Sue: Can you meet with Brown/Gamson? Others have thoughts about these meetings?  PS  Boeing's lobbyist told Katz today (Davis' point person on 78)that the date must be September 1, period.  Katz told the Boeing lobbyist that the August 25th date is there to "screw Enron." Hedy has confirmed that Raytheon is also working the date issue.  Best, Jeff 
 Dorothy has informed that CMTA will file solo.  (Keith's got kids in expensive colleges, you know.) 
 Great minds think alike.  That is EXACTLY the opening line that Wanda and Michael and I came up with on a brief call this morning.  Will do. 
 As far as i know, we can get together tomorrow night. 
 FYI. 
 Will do.  Did you folks have a call today?  If you folks are going to have one every week, could we set up a standing time and call-in number?  Be happy to participate on these and any other issues.  Best, Jeff 
 Perfect.  Thanks. 
 FYI.  Angelides is trying to turn the screws on Loretta. ********************************************************************* Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. "What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. "There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said. 
  Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. "What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. "There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act."

 Feel free to send it along.  But as you know, things are somewhat difficult these days.  I'll get it to the right people, however.  Best, Jeff 
 We are OUT of the pool.  I want my money back.  Prentice, please get your stuff out of my apartment.  You can have the cats.  Love, Jeff  Thanks for helping, Nancy. So what place are we in? 
 It's hardball time.  I'd be careful going up against UC/CSU, though. 
 thanks very much. 
 Thanks very much for all your help.  Can I call you tomorrow morning to discuss?  Best, Jeff  PS Shapiro likes to kid.  We're going to do everything we can in the meeting to try to settle this darn thing. 
 Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis By Michael B. Marois Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week. 
 Maybe the best thing for you to do is take a cab from the Hyatt to the Burbank airport Monday morning.  My flight arrives on Southwest  (from Oakland) at about 8 AM.  I've rented a car.  Then we can drive to Edison from there (it's about 30 minutes from the airport), east of Pasadena on 10.  Then I can drive you back with me from Rosemead and you can catch a cab from Burbank to LAX.  Should be pretty easy that way.  Jeff 
 Dan:  Please add California Cast Metals Association to the list of signatories.  Thanks. Jeff 
 Dan:  The chamber of commerce (because it never really plays at the PUC) has decided to sign on to CMTA's letter that it will submit, rather than sign on to the ARM filing.  Please remove them from the list of signatories.  Thanks. Best, Jeff 
 On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."  I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."  The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:  Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?) Bob Foster--Edison Nettie Hoge--head of TURN Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated) State Senator Debra Bowen David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)  Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.  Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  I'll call you in the afternoon.  Jeff 
 FYI:  To update what we've learned today regarding possibility of Senate going forward on Wed. with contempt.  At this point, appears they intend to go forward.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let me know if there are others I missed, or if there are changes needed to the ones listed.   1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.  3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)  4.	Cost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund, 	and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial.  Key risks associated with each category: Adverse to P/L Adverse to hedge (demand risk) 
 No problem here.  That price is making DWR's contracts look worse and worse every day.  Poor California.  Jeff, if you have questions or want to discuss further, don't hesitate to call me or Sue, though Paul can likely answer most questions.  Best, Jeff 
 Did governor Jessie eliminate the role in Minnesota?  I believe that it's the equivalent of a state historian.  Thanks for the feedback.  Best, Jeff 
 In the constant state of "blur" I'm in, I somehow unintentionally left you off the note.  Your comments/thoughts/feedback is of course greatly appreciated. Best, Jeff 
 I'm around.  Could you forward me the "matrix."  (sounds so "classified."  I love it.)  Best, Jeff 
 thank you. 
 No problem.  Thanks for the response.  I understand the need to keep powder dry.  Talked to Hertzberg this morning.  The 3rd extraordinary ain't sounding like it's going to be a winner.  Hope to talk soon.  Best, Jeff 
 SCE's problem is that no one except Davis and Edison are for the bailout.  With respect to DA, only Burton's in the way.  So Davis and Edison have the world against; and DA only has Burton against it.  I'm at loss to determine which is worse off, which speaks to the craziness of the state of things.  Best, Jeff 
 Good idea.  Thanks.  Yes, I'm around. 
 hey, prentice has a friend in town whom you may have met.  very cool, very funny.  we'd bring her along if that's ok, and if you still want to get together tonite, which we're totally up for. let me know.  and it would be a good idea to get together since we should probably talk a bit about Jay's place.  he's been inquiring about what we're thinking.  best, jeff 
 See email.  Call w/Sanders et al @ 5PM CDT to update contempt action.  Best, Jeff 
 let's do it at my place.  is pauline's, salad and wine in order? 
 Please consider this my response to your request to forward my schedule for next week.  mon.-s.f. tues.-sacramento wed.-sacramento? thurs-sacramento? fril-sacramento?  Your welcome in advance.  annoyingly yours, jeff  thanks for the travel package. 
 Gracias. 
 THIRD EXTRAORDINARY SESSION CALLED Governor Davis has called a special session on Tuesday, October 9 to consider and act upon legislation affecting the operation, maintenance, finances, and financial viability of investor-owned utilities that provide electricity or natural gas to California residents and businesses, including their procurement portfolios and practices, and service by alternate energy providers in their service territory. Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures Call of Special Session: Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. Introduction of Special Session Bills: There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. End of Special Session: Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto. 
 Check this out.  I want to get any comments you might have before I sent it around.

  Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let  us know if the list looks about right.  FYI:  Sue and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with Steve Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks.  Finally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks.  For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc.  Best, Jeff  1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.  3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)  4.	Cost allocation: The PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general 	fund, and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial.  Additional suggestions from Mike Day:  5.	DASR processing :  If the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension in an onerous way, it may 	put at risk contracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.  6.	Confidentiality of contract information:  The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01. 
 FYI.  We can discuss further on Monday.  You may see something in the press about it.  Best, Jeff 
 See my and Sue's email. 
 FYI. 
 My money's on Mirant/Reliant as the leak.

Best, Jeff 8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged. By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers  September 30 2001  SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study.  The biggest problems are so-called "take or pay" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said.  The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups.  Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades.  Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state.  "If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it," said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has "no intention of asking for renegotiation" on its own.  Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, "I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction."  And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. "We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations," he said.  For his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table.  "Would we love to get a better deal?" Maviglio said. "Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table."  S. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said.  "Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit," said Freeman, "but it's a good thing to have."  But William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined.  The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group.  The study singled out for criticism:  * A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost.  The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not.  * A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be "peakers," designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity.  "They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million," said Marcus. "That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much."  * A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity.  * An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area.  * A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed.  * Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said.  One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour.  But a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour.  "When you compare those two contracts," Marcus said, "you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate."  * An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go.  * A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer.  Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices.  "The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty," said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas."  When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire.  Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring.  Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said.  Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added.  "I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy," Marcus said.  "I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin."

I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate."  * An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go.  * A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer.  Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices.  "The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty," said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas."  When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire.  Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring.  Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said.  Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added.  "I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy," Marcus said.  "I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin." 
 Consider me reminded.  Thank you. 
 Now that I've got your attention:  Whatever you're doing, keep it up, baby!  The stock's been moving up and up.  Keep doing it, man.  Best, Jeff 
 Go Barry! 
 FYI. Split between Davis and Lynch is now very public.  Davis is likely losing his mind.  Can Ron Carroll or Dan Watkiss search these filings down at FERC?  Thanks. Best, Jeff  State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. "The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated," Commissioner Richard Bilas said. "I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down." The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. "It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. "It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out," Hidalgo said. "If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up." The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. STATE TREASURER'S WARNING State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. "We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years," Lynch said last week. "We should stay as flexible as possible. Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. "The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract," he said. "Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract." Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. "Now another California agency is disputing it," Mitchell said. "We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored." PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. "News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers," the PUC said. An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. ***************************************************

 FYI.  Long piece criticizing the Forbes' article criticizing Enron.  Not bad. 
   >FYI.  Please keep confidential.  John White's trying to go after the contracts.  Hap Boyd, who's on his Board, is opposing John's action and asking him not to go forward.  Too bad.  He was ready to launch.  Not sure what Hap's sensitivities are.  John's asked me not to intervene at this point.  Best, Jeff 
 Really appreciate the note.  Great working with you.  Best, Jeff 
 I love it.  Unfortunately, ENA would likely go bonkers since many of the folks whose deals we'd be bettering also happen to be big ENA customers.  If there's a way to finesse it (e.g., "Enron offers State big power deal for 1/2 what State contracted for"), it would really bring the house down.  But I think that ENA would get damn queasy about doing it. 
 i.e., "sign up, or else."  (I love it when you're tough.) 
 you're b-day.  if you guys would like to go there, that's just peachy with us.  really. 
 I'm hooting just thinking about it.  Could we get someone else to do it?  (Problem is just about everybody who could do it is in the soup because they're holding one of those stinking DWR contracts.) 
 Thanks. You're call.  Might be a good idea to talk with him in advance.  Let me know what you think. Or, given the time crunch, just contacting his office to find out what his angle will be would be helpful--I also assume he'll spend his time 1) singing PA's praises and 2) claiming that DA can work, if done right, both of which are great messages.  Best, Jeff 
 I took a quick look.  In short: --create regulatory asset out of the PX credit --collect on utility bills as dedicated rate component --silent on who should pay the charge.  Best, Jeff 
 Oh dear.  Get a story straight?  That's moving the bar pretty darned high, ain't it?  Wednesday looks good for me.

 Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. "It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report.

 Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.  Summary of our offer: Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01. Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%. In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC. In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.  Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal: Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates. Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals. Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.  We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.  Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.  Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.  Best, Jeff 
 California Retailers Association Supports PG&E Reorganization Plan SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- California Retailers Association today released the following statement on Pacific Gas and Electric Company's proposal to emerge from bankruptcy: "The California Retailers Association supports this plan because of the many benefits it offers to California, its consumers, and its businesses." "We are pleased that this proposal would allow PG&E to pay the tens of thousands of small businesses who are owed money -- in full, with interest. These firms, through no fault of their own, have been hurt by this energy crisis, and should be made whole -- and will be, under this proposal." "We are particularly pleased that PG&E's plan does not include any kind of rate increase. With our economy hanging in the balance, the last thing California consumers or small businesses need is higher utility rates. The plan also will provide consumers with power pricing stability -- by locking in long-term prices for power at a relatively low price. This will benefit all customers by establishing fair prices that won't spike over time." "Finally, it is critically important to note that the plan is designed to return PG&E to financial viability so that the State of California can get out of the power procurement business, which has been taking funds away from other economic and social programs. The plan also does not require any legislative action or any financial bailout, so the State's attention and funds may once again be focused on their appropriate objectives." The California Retailers Association is a trade association representing major California department and specialty stores, mass merchandisers, grocery, chain drug and convenience stores. Our members have more than 9,000 stores in California and account for more than $100 billion in sales annually. 
 Thanks very much.  I faxed one the PUC filed against the Colton contract. 
 Pure PG&E.  They'll be talking to just about everyone and greasing palms to get more of the same.  Can't wait to see who else jumps on the wagon. 
 Horrible, unfortunately.  He was the loudest, most articulate voice appearing before the PUC on the 20th, staunchly--and I mean staunchly--opposing DA.  If I see him, I'm going to get all over him.  But me thinks the contracts are in for a wild ride. 
 Thanks very much. 
 Doesn't look good.  USA: Shares of NewPower plummet in midday trade.  10/01/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Shares of electricity provider NewPower Holdings were down almost 20 percent on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, but the company had no comment on the share drop. Shares of NewPower were down 55 cents, or 17.9 percent, to $2.53 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. "We don't comment on stock activity. We are reporting our earnings in November," said Gael Doar, spokeswoman for NewPower. NewPower, which bills itself as the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers, recently became the outside provider with the greatest share for competitive energy providers as part of the Texas's deregulation.

 Alan: Two things.  1) Assuming that you're lead on the meeting (i.e., agenda, facilitate meeting)---if not, just let us know and we'll take the reins.  2) Seems appropriate to invite Jim to participate.  Sure he'll be interested.  Your call.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  I'm in Goucester Mass this week but am getting the message to folks from here.  You launching on the contracts?  Best, Jeff 
 Tee hee (ki barber) 
 FYI.  May be useful for Thursday's meeting.  Best, Jeff 
 In terms of our proposal, went over it with Wanda and Michael last week, and they, I believe, ran it by Swain.  The real issue is what (if anything) we do about Edison's desire to lock down undercollection and DWR stranded costs as part of the deal (which they likely view as a pretty good hedge, since it's looking less than 50-50 that the Legislature isn't going to pull it off).  Best, Jeff 
 Call me. 
  Thanks for coming by yesterday.  Look forward to getting the deck up and hopefully working on many other projects in the future.  Zip me a fax when you get the materials quote at 415.782.7854.  Best, Jeff 
 Should you care, on Friday at the Hotel Monaco in SF, Law Seminars International is having a conference about electric restructuring in CA. The 8:30 AM panel is "status and implications of the PG&E Bankruptcy" with Jim Lopes and LInda Ekstrom.  I'll be in Sacramento that day.  Best, Jeff 
 This looks very good.  One suggestion:  May be a little ambitious to do #2, and really ambitious to do #2 for the entire West.  May want to priortize in some small way, like, what are the 5 things that most affect the book (maybe confined to California?).  Just a suggestion.  I'm comfortable doing the whole nine yards.  Just concerned that we may fail to cover some really big risks that are lurking on the horizon in the near term if we choose not to focus down just a bit.  That said, seems real important to complete the comprehensive view as you've set out in the agenda as soon as we can (e.g., next four weeks, or so).  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Big customers were hesitant to sign on to the ARM filing, but they were cajoled into filing on their own.  They seem to hit the mark pretty well.  Best, Jeff 
   SUMMARY OF THE DRAFT RATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PUC AND DWR   The Bond Structure ? Keeps the state in the power selling business for 15 years - the life of the bonds - because the bonds are repaid solely from the state's power purchase revenues and no other repayment source. ? Designed as a "net revenue bond," meaning bondholders are paid last and all other DWR costs and expenses are paid first.  In order to sell net revenue bonds, DWR must show that it has guaranteed revenues to both: (1) carry out its entire operations and (2) generate enough profit to pay off the bonds.  As a result, the rating of a net revenue bond depends on the overall financial health of the company - in this case, a guarantee that the overall power purchase program instituted by DWR will be paid for by ratepayers for 15 years. ? Requires that California's current energy policies and programs are set in place and not subject to further political or policy changes for at least the next 15 years and that the continued operation of this program will generate enough income to meet all the program's possible financial needs for the life of the bonds. ? Ratepayers will pay for the state's power purchase program as long as the bonds are outstanding.   The Rate Agreement ? Requires the Commission to adjust rates in 45 to 90 days when DWR sends over a revenue requirement.  The Commission is limited only to correcting mathematical error or costs outside the agreement's scope.  If the Commission does not adjust rates according to DWR's estimated revenue calculations, the Bond Trustee may enforce bondholders' rights to have rates established at a level that satisfies DWR. ? May require the Commission to require all utilities to take DWR's power and deliver it to customers in their service territories before the utilities sell their own, often lower cost power to customers in each service territory. ? Precludes utilities from returning to the business of providing 100% of their customers' electricity needs for the life of the bonds because the state must stay in the business of buying and selling power to meet the requirements of a net revenue bond.  Guarantees DWR receives whatever revenue it needs for all of its power programs and establishes the State in the power business for at least 15 years, the life of the bonds. ? Because the bonds can be repaid only from DWR sales, suggests the need to change the Legislatively imposed mandate that DWR's program "sunset" at the end of 2002.   Already, the financial community has expressed concern about this provision.  In response, DWR's comments on the Rate Agreement suggested that an extension of the sunset by Executive Order could allow DWR to continue purchasing power in a way that would be funded through Commission-approved revenue requirements. ? Provides generators, who negotiated long-term contracts with the state during the very height of the energy crisis when market power was being exercised, irrevocable 15-year assurances that those power purchase deals will be treated as solidly as if they were loans from the generators to the State. ? Interferes with Federal or other court efforts to review the long-term contracts entered into by the state.  Because the existence of those contracts is essential to the continuation of the bond deal, the state would not be able to take advantage of any change in circumstance or law that would reduce dependence on disadvantageous long-term contracts. ? The Commission must also enforce rules so that utilities can bill and collect on DWR's behalf, and customers are subject to disconnection for failure to pay for electricity provided by DWR. ? Constitutes irrevocable financing document - the Commission may not alter or modify any of its provisions without DWR's agreement.  DWR will likely need to obtain bondholder approval before agreeing to any changes.  Remains in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding, regardless of how many bonds are issued.   The Challenges to the Rate Agreement ? Eleven parties filed comments opposed to the Rate Agreement. ? Received comments in support only from DWR, the office of the State Treasurer, and the investment bank underwriting the bond transaction. ? Received strong opposition citing numerous flaws with the rate agreement, including: o The Commission cannot make the iron-clad guarantee to meet DWR's revenue requirement o Unconstitutional, contrary to general principles of utilities law, and outside the scope of AB 1X, the statute that allows DWR to buy power o DWR has acted illegally and the Commission's actions are illegal because they rely on allegedly improper conduct on the part of DWR Oppose the requirement that the Commission must ensure that DWR has the physical ability to stay in business using the utilities distribution networks.

 What time on Wednesday? 
 THE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE BRINGS HEAVY HITTERS TO HAAS All faculty, students, staff, and alumni are invited to the 6th annual Women in Leadership Conference, which takes place on Saturday, October 20. This year's theme, "Explore, Inspire, Excel," is embodied by two exceptional keynote speakers: Donna Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO of Handspring, and Beth Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive vice president of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.  The annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at Haas. Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay Area.  Dubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded Handspring with Jeff Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of hand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted new computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from Apple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.  Beth Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is also a member of the executive committee for The Charles Schwab Corporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address.

 Did anyone else get the attachment?  If not, Paul, could you resend?  Thanks. 
 could you give me a call when you've got 5 minutes.  i have a very quick question.  thanks a lot.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 I'm real sorry to bug you with this, but you and I will need to do some research so that I can make sure that I'm reporting properly.  Please stop by when you get a minute.  Thanks very much.  Jeff 
 Do we have a boiled down version of the judge's proposed order in the PNW refund case? If we do, I'd like to start disseminating it liberally around California, and would also like to use it at this forum I'll be speaking at on Friday.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Barry:  Congratulations on side-stepping what many (including us) thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions. We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened.  I have a quick question:  Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named Mark Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.  Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark.  With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.  Thanks for your time and hope all is well.  Best, Jeff 
 In case you hadn't seen it, your pal Vikram's taking some pretty hard knocks right about now.  Hope all is well. Best, Jeff Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. "It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp. (CPN <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=CPN>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=CPN>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=CPN>), according to the report. Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report. 
 Yank, yank, yank.  Loretta's tubing Davis as we write.  Chill, dude. 
 The Senate Rules Committee just met.  During the hearing, Senate Leader John Burton stated that: the Senate intends to rewrite the version of the MOU that the Assembly approved last Thursday night and sent over to the Senate for final approval (SB78). the version of the MOU that will emerge from the Senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the Senate prior to the July summer recess.  That bill was unacceptable to Edison and Davis, which led to the version that the Assembly developed and approved last Thursday night. If the Senate proceeds as Burton suggests, the chances are very low that an MOU will make it through the Legislature and get Davis' signature. Burton generally sticks to his word. But there is still time for additional negotiations and SB78 could squeak by. However, Burton's comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival. Finally, the Assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill, and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage.  More information on the windfall profits bill as we get it.  Best, Jeff

 In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC. The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood. Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.  What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC? It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers. It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.  What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal? With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts. The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably. It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months. Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January. In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds. Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.  What Next? A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support. The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue. Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget. The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result. All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it. Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel. Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.  Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.  If you have any questions, just let us know.  Best, Jeff 
 That's great.  More the merrier.  I assume you heard about what happened at the PUC today.  I think it classfies as amazing.  The planets may be favorably re-aligning just a little bit (one hopes).  Best, Jeff

 there's a movie that Grisman's daughter did about Grisman and Jerry and bluegrass that opens at the embarcadero on wednesday.  might be worth checking out. 
 In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:  The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003 Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection") If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005. Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection. Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off. Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B. Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk. Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates) The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place. Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers. The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced  We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.  Best, Jeff 
  PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include: ?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap. ?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment. ?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers. ?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs. ?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities. ?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually. "This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  "The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers." This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal. 
 Assume for now at least that the currently allocation stands pat.  Pretty crazy, huh?  Gotta hand it to Loretta Lynch.  Best, Jeff 
 See email.  PUC bailed out Edison today.  No kidding.  Jeff 
 I have a copy of the settlement between the PUC and Edison if you want me to fax it to you.

 would you like me to participate? 
 Just give me a call.  you want to shoot for 10:30 my time? 
 FYI.  Please keep to yourself at this point.  You hear anything from Norm about the PUC machinations? 
 i'll be here.  just give a call. 
 have him call sue mara at 415.782.7802. 
 Much happened yesterday--wow!--and at least for now, it appears that Loretta has let the Legislature off the hook--appears that the PUC is still a fairly potent institution. But it also appears that what had been (a foreseeable and avoidable) energy crisis, is now by and large a pretty messy state fiscal and political crisis for our good friends in Sacramento, so I don't think that legislators, irrespective of their wishes, can avoid staying involved. Add 18XX to the mix and the signing/veto process generally, and, well, Sacramento still seems pretty darned relevant. As such, we will have our regularly scheduled call tomorrow at 11:30.  Best, Jeff 
 No rush.  Whenever it's convenient for you.  Just let me know, and let me when you need the check  and for how much.  Kisses, Jeff  Go Giants!  Go Barry!  PS  Just wait'll next year!

 Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California Edison expects to pay all creditors "immediately," but the Edison International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said John Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Edison International. "We intend to pay all of our creditors," Bryson said Wednesday in a call with reporters. "But we do not have a specific date." Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates. Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers. The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday. Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. "There is no deal between us and the generators at this point," Bryson said. "We will engage promptly" in settlement discussions. "We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way." Ted Craver, Edison's chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt. Bryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade "immediately." "We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies," Bryson said. "But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time." Bryson added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate.  Stephen Frank, president of Southern California Edison, said the utility would sit down with all of its creditors and work out a payment plan. Bryson said the utility believes that all of its debt can be paid off by the end of 2003. He did not say how much money from retail rates would be carved out for paying off Southern California Edison's debt. The utility's debt rose to $6.35 billion, according to a recent Securities and Exchange filing. "In the month of October we generated about $300 million" from retail rates. But Bryson said he could not estimate how much of that will be set aside to pay creditors. The utility and the PUC both said rates will not have to increase beyond the record rate hikes state regulators ordered earlier this year. Bryson said the utility has no intention of taking over the state's long-term power supply contracts as a result of the deal with the PUC.  Fearing the state legislature wouldn't support a bill to rescue Southern Califoria Edison after six months of wrangling, advisers to Gov. Gray Davis and Edison executives began negotiating with the state's Public Utilities Commission on a settlement of a year-old lawsuit the utility filed to force the commission to raise rates enough to cover its power costs. The negotiations with the PUC were kept secret from state lawmakers in case a settlement couldn't be reached, Davis aides and Edison executives said. The end result, Edison and the commission said, is a deal that will allow the utility to work out a plan to pay off its creditors and keep Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy. 
 Thank you Robert for pointing that out.  I think there is/will be an opportunity--if we can ever get paid, and if we can ever comfortable from a credit standpoint--and my apologies for not having flagged that sooner.  Too many balls.........in the air.  Best, Jeff 
 Don't hate me for sending a note.  What do you think? "California made two big mistakes:  First, they never made a market.  They didn't deregulate.  They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including Enron.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up." "Enron's the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or India or Sweden, Enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.  Houston is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well.  What makes the "virtual" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company.  That allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions. It's been a great experience." 
 Attached is a draft agenda for tomorrow's meeting.  If there's anything we've missed, we can amend the agenda prior to starting tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks a millino for your help. 
 I can make it. 
 Sue's will be in Houston for this, but will there be a call-in number to tap into for some of the discussion?  Thanks a lot.  Best, Jeff

 Listening to the Edison call w/investors Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("big bang" approach) sometime in Q1'02. My concern is that between now and then Dunn, the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators/marketers' claims. Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators--asking about haircuts in particular--and Edison is side-stepping the questions. 
 Great.  Figured they'd contacted them, but wanted to make sure.  You know when the meeting with schedulers will be?  I apologize, I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be.  I'm thinking that I may want to attend.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 We should resurrect Mike Smith's note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.  I can dig it up if you'd like. 
 Sounds good. 
 Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. Or maybe not. While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. "We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. "The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. "Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. "To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. "First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC. Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. "In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. "The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. "It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. "There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. "But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" ***************************************************************** State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register, 10.07.01 SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. "We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." New contracts would increase 'green' power In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. "I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the state's businesses are critical. They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. "I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. "It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. "The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

 FYI. Looks like Brown might not be getting the presidency right away....  Best, Jeff  **************************************************** PUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in Edison Deal Politics: Insisting on her agency's independence, Loretta Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her. SACRAMENTO -- Once again last week, California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch gave Gov. Gray Davis help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged.  With the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a $3.3-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday.  Although Davis appointed Lynch as PUC president, she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway. "I will take responsibility," Lynch said.  Even as she took the lead in forging an Edison deal, Lynch defied the governor Tuesday. She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that Davis and Treasurer Phil Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year. Davis condemned the vote as "an irresponsible act."  Davis repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act. Lynch, however, is not easily controlled. She has moved ahead without the governor's approval several times. Most notably, last spring, she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while Davis was publicly opposed to a rate hike.  Such actions have made her perhaps Davis' least favorite appointee.  And yet, Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is Davis' single most pressing issue: how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January.  For months, those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury. Unless a way is found to close it, Davis may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection. He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a $12.5-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers.  Davis would not discuss Lynch for this article. But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries. A top aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the governor's relationship with Lynch, who once served on Davis' staff, as "nonexistent."  But floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC, and Davis aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch, whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever, according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency.  Davis could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner, but "he can't remove commissioners," said the Davis aide who described the tension between the two. "We are in a position where we're going to have to negotiate."  A Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San Francisco before joining the administration, Lynch worked on Davis' 1998 campaign, helping him raise money. He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning, then placing her on the PUC in late 1999.  Lynch has taken seriously the idea, enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC, that the commission is supposed to be independent.  She recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code, written 90 years ago, and concluding that Progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson envisioned "an independent agency, independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor, [that] would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing."  "Before, I was on [Davis'] staff, and as staff, you are supposed to follow the lead absolutely of your boss," Lynch said. "Now, I was appointed to an independent constitutional body. While I feel I've built bridges to the governor and the Legislature, I take very seriously the PUC's constitutional independence."  Critics, including many in the Davis administration and some in the Legislature, call Lynch unbending. She is particularly adamant on the commission's independence.  Insisting on Independence  Accounts of how the Edison deal was reached underline Lynch's insistence on preserving the PUC's independent authority. The events also show how strong a position she holds as the PUC and the administration negotiate over the bond deal.  Starting in April, when he unveiled his proposed rescue of Edison, Davis and his aides lobbied hard to win support in the Legislature. Davis had no Republican support, and faced skepticism from fellow Democrats.  Lynch was another skeptic; Davis' proposal would have weakened the PUC's authority to regulate Edison. Her criticism of the proposal strengthened the hand of Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco), an ally of Lynch's and the most influential critic of the governor's proposal.  Davis did win approval of a modified version of his plan in the Assembly. But late on Sept. 14, the Senate adjourned for the year without agreeing to any Edison bill.  The governor said he would order lawmakers to return to Sacramento in early October for a special session to consider it again.  Lynch seized an opportunity. She wanted to escape a $5.5-billion federal lawsuit that Edison had filed against the PUC. She also figured there might be a way to restructure Edison's debt without the bells and whistles proposed by Davis and other lawmakers.  It was a good time to talk. Wholesale electricity prices were down significantly, interest rates were falling, and the rate increase she had pushed through earlier in the year had made more money available to the utility.  "When we looked at the numbers fresh, we realized that the numbers had changed," enough that Edison might avoid bankruptcy without a complex legislative bailout, Lynch said.  At her direction, PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen made the initial call to Edison.  Edison, PUC Started Secret Talks  Edison executives had their doubts that the PUC could resolve the utility's problems. In their view, past inaction by the commission had helped bring the firm to the brink of bankruptcy.  But with prospects uncertain in the Legislature, both sides met Sept. 19 in the San Francisco offices of the utility's private counsel, Munger, Tolles & Olson. Talks went on for 12 days.  The PUC had three conditions. "One, we would try to see if we could assure them enough in rates to pay back down their debt over a certain period," Cohen said. "Second, there would have to be a sharing of pain by shareholders. And third, there could be no terms that would limit or restrict the commission's regulatory authority."  Lynch and the PUC staff kept negotiations secret. Word of the talks could stampede creditors into forcing the utility into bankruptcy, they feared. Another concern was that the talks could jeopardize a legislative solution to Edison's problem.  Lynch did notify her fellow commissioners, whose support she would need to pull off a settlement. PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of three Davis appointees on the five-member board, said Lynch told him Sept. 21 "in the strictest confidence" about the negotiations with Edison.  "If it became public, it could blow up," Brown said. "There would be too much hullabaloo."  For several days, however, Lynch did not inform Davis. Meanwhile, the governor's aides continued to hold talks in hopes of putting together a legislative compromise.  On Sept. 25, some of Davis' top aides met with key legislative staffers in a daylong session. By the end of the meeting, both sides realized a major gulf remained.  That same day, Lynch called Sacramento to pass word to Davis that the talks were underway. A few lawmakers also were told. Two days later, the governor announced that he was postponing by a week his call for the Legislature to return for a special session. One reason for the delay was to see whether the PUC could seal a deal.  Over the next several days, the commission and utility lawyers hammered out the details of the $3.3-billion rescue plan, finalizing a deal about 11 p.m. Sept. 30.  "It would not have gotten over the finish line without her," said attorney Ron Olson, an Edison board member who helped represent the utility in the talks.  While those negotiations were going on, Davis was going to extraordinary lengths to persuade the PUC to approve the other major item on the commission's plate: his proposal for the bond deal.  The issue is complex. But at its root, Lynch said, the proposal pushed by Davis and Angelides to pay off the bonds would have the effect of locking in multiyear power contracts that the Davis administration struck with independent power producers.  Lynch and several lawmakers contend that the administration is committing the state to buy too much electricity at excessive prices and seeking to limit the PUC's authority.  The PUC under Lynch has challenged aspects of the administration's power contracts in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Knowing that Lynch opposed the proposal, the governor tried to create a majority that would bypass her. He did not call Lynch, but did call Republican commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque.  The governor's lobbying changed no votes; his proposal lost 4 to 1 with only Brown siding with him.  But his efforts appear to have enhanced Lynch's standing among her fellow commissioners, including the two Republicans, who are appointees of former Gov. Pete Wilson.  Commissioners Praise Lynch  In Bilas' view, the call from the governor showed that Lynch had the mettle to vote against the administration proposal, even if it might cost her her job as PUC president.  "There are only two kinds of people who can serve: a yes man, or a person who believes that the commission was set up to be independent, and she is of the second type," Bilas said.  Brown, the only commissioner to vote for the administration's bond proposal, credits Lynch as well.  "She stood up for the authority of the PUC," Brown said. Brown--a cousin of Davis' onetime boss, former Gov. Jerry Brown--is a potential successor to Lynch as president if Davis decides to demote her. He has not been offered the post and does not want it, Brown said.  "I hope they don't remove her as president," Brown said. "She is a feisty, independent individual, but she is capable of enormous good work. If you appoint her, you have to take her on days you agree with her and days you disagree with her. She is not going to be a sycophant, and that is to her credit."

 Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. Or maybe not. While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. "We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically," said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal." Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. "The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts," Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. "Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts," Shames said. Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. "To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster," said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. "There were other means to manage the emergency." The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. "First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms," said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC. Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are "just and reasonable." FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. "In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so," said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. "We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone." Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. "The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market," said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. "It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' " Niggli said. But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. "There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to," White said. "The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. "But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?" State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. "We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. "The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. Said Freeman: "We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks." New contracts would increase 'green' power In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called "peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. "I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the state's businesses are critical. They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. "I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. "It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But "it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. "The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. "Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.'' 
 Thanks so much for the Storybook wine.  Extremely sweet of you, and we really appreciate it.  I gave Eldon the check for it.  Man, did we get CREAMED in the pool.  Sigh....  Best, Jeff 
 Just wanted to make sure that you have seen the announcement about the move, the meeting (on the 18th) they're having to explain and the brief description.  If not, let me know and I'll fax it to you.  And unless you have any objections, I'm seriously considering attending the meeting, since this has been one of the biggest problems we've had in the gas industry in California.  Let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you very much for your kind voicemail.  Unfortunately for Gov't Affairs, unless Steve and Rick have other plans, you all are stuck with me since I love working for Enron (even in California!).  Bizarre rumor, the origins of which baffle me....  Thanks again for the sweet voicemail.  And holy moly, sounds like you and Christi are going to be extremely busy at FERC.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the response.  I think that I've got it cleared up.  I'm assuming that the time for our case write is "the present," i.e., September 2001.  If I've got that wrong, let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 I would have been happy to let you have it.  You still can, you know.  Just let me know (though we love to keep it).  We're allegedly going to the dome this weekend, so perhaps we could pick it up on our way back on Sunday.  But if that's a bother, don't worry about it--we can do it another time.  And what about those 9-ers? 
 how we doing on the one-pager? 
 Greetings.  Heard that Barry might in California this week?  Someone mentioned there may be attempts to meet with DWR.  Just checking, since DWR seems to be radioactive these days.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  In case you hadn't heard, the " bailout" that Edison struck with the California PUC would allow Edison to spend up to $250MM "to hedge fuel cost risks associated with SCE's Utility Retained Generation and QF and interutility contracts." 
 I would bet that we'll be there.  I'll bring my check book.  Is the 97 cab $32 retail?  If it is, it's worth it.  With Barry doing what he did, getting to the playoffs was icing on the cake.  But, man, that Friday night game was a heart-breaker.  We'll see you Sunday!  Kisses, Jeff 
 I apologize.  My schedule went crazy. But I will have the update for you first thing in the morning.  Promise.  Best, Jeff 
 Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor? When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the "energy crisis," an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor. 
 Power providers cry foul over fees State is accused of improper billing Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration. The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. "The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them," Smutney-Jones said. An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to "bury" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. "The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO," Ackerman said. The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusations "absolutely false" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs. "The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento," Maviglio said. "It shouldn't be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement." Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisis. "I don't feel sorry for them one bit," Hidalgo said. "They had one heck of a year." Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become "a political arm of the governor." The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. Davis has warned Washington to "keep its hands off" the ISO. 
 Dear Ms DSL:  Looks like no DWR meeting this week.  Thanks for the tip.  Best, Jeff 
 Oh, they're trying alright...but we have conflict with the consultant they've hired.  I'll fill you in another time.  (DWR is radioactive, though, and we shouldn't be doing any deals with them right now.) 
 Rick: Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible. **************************************************************************  Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50% To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market) If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short. Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA) Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts. Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible. 
 de nada 
 Since the bills that passed are all Burton/Senate bills, it may be the case that a deal has been cut at the leadership level involving 78 and the other energy-related bills (SB 18 in particular). Scott, Hedy, Bev---Can you do a bit of checking to see if this is the case?  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 See your email re: contract/DA fix.  I'm in office.  Jeff 
 Mike Day and I talked.  Mike agreed that there's "elbow room" in PUC regulations that would allow PG&E to do the financial swap we talked about late yesterday without having to get regulatory approval.  However, Mike also agreed that there's some risk (moderate to low in our view) that the PUC could try to ding the utility--for whatever reason--next time it goes under review as part of its general rate case.  In the end, PG&E will have to decide whether doing the financial with us is--in PG&E's view--overly aggressive or not from a regulatory perspective.  In short, doesn't seem to be any real downside in raising it and seeing how PG&E responds.  If this doesn't answer the question sufficiently, let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 yes. 
 As things change, so do call schedules.  We conferred and have recommend that:  There will not be a call this week. Beginning next week, the call will take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT), same call-in number (we hope). Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento.  If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know. And please forward to others who need/would like to know.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much. 
 Only if you still agree to be surprised... 
 Thanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.  Thanks for the info.  Best, Jeff 
 got it. 
 It seems that since we've already contributed, we're invited.  Given where Davis' numbers have gone recently, Riordan's imminent announcement and potential, and the fact that the Rs have played it about as well as could be expected under the circumstances (save for Morrow, who we may want to bring up with Brulte if the lunch is attended, this could be a useful gathering.  And it doesn't require crossing the border into California, to boot.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey, I haven't seen you at all and have been thinking about you.  Just wanted to check in and see how things are going.  Hope you are well and things are going swimmingly.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey, Jean.  Man, who don't you know???  Anyway, I'm sorry to bug you, but I'd like to try to get a meeting with Ms Doll ASAP.  If there's anyway that we can manage that, I'd, of course, be eternally indebted.  Best, Jeff 
 Another defeat for Davis.  Tough break.  Is the judge's proposed decision available? Best, Jeff FERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An administrative law judge has recommended the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismiss a complaint alleging El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California . The ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants. "While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power," Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday. The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation. In a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's "standards of conduct" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates. "El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline, and El Paso Merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse," Wagner concluded. "There was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding" by the marketing unit for El Paso pipeline capacity into California , Wagner said. FERC had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on March 28 without a hearing. At Wagner's request, the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint. The proceeding, which began April 4 and concluded August 6, resulted in a hearing record of 32 volumes and totaled 5,573 pages, while 515 exhibits were entered into evidence, Wagner reported. "The briefs measured approximately one linear foot," he said.  Contracting With Affiliates  At issue are contracts worth $38.5 million that El Paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into California from March 2000 through June 2001. California argued El Paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices. The contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility, in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent. The judge found that the contracts gave El Paso Merchant more than a 35% market share, the market-power threshold under FERC's merger guidelines, based on his interpretation of the relevant market. El Paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 50%, but Wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply. But while that market share gave El Paso the "ability to exercise market power," Wagner said, "it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that El Paso Merchant and El Paso Pipeline exercised market power." The record offers only mixed support for allegations by the CPUC and utilities in the state that El Paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices, Wagner said. From March through October 2000, El Paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers, while for the remainder of the contract, the full capacity was used. Wagner concluded that El Paso's compliance with FERC rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power.  Improper Communications Seen  Where the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing, where Wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse. Wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that El Paso violated FERC rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another. The rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers. Transcripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of El Paso "demonstrate blatant collusion ... to keep secret a discount for service" on El Paso's Mojave system until the open season was over in which Merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline, Wagner said, including the transcripts in his opinion. Wagner determined that the transcript offered a "prima facie" case of affiliate abuse, and urged El Paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding. But El Paso declined to present the witnesses, the opinion noted. Wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to William Wise, El Paso's chief executive, from the head of El Paso Merchant as contributing to his conclusion that El Paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates "were in clear violation" of FERC's affiliate-abuse rules. El Paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its March 28 ruling. The commission would commit a "legal error" if it adopted the judge's views, the company said. The parties have 30 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings. The commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings. However the commission ultimately rules in the case, it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court. 
 Thanks.  Any word yet on how well Jim's crushing the arguments of the monopolists in DC? 
 FYI.  Sue Mara is the GA lead and is working with the ESP and customer groups to respond to (and if at all possible, work with) the utilities.  Best, Jeff

 ditto. sounds good. 
 FYI.  I don't know if this means that Sue and I both get a ticket, or if there's only one.  If someone from Houston--or another office--is interested, we'd be happy to accommodate.  Otherwise, I'm sure that we'll take full advantage of the opporunity.  Just let us know.  Best, Jeff 
 Not a problem.  Thanks for the info.  I've got a couple more questions.  I'll call you in a bit.  Thanks again.  Jeff 
 thanks. 
 California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said. The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. Davis `Willing to Discuss' ``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. `A Blank Check' Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. ``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. ``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.'' 
 keep up the good work!  Sue's got it covered.  But I'll be there soon enough.  You know, I just received this note.  Wonder if something's wrong with the network.  Best, Jeff 
 PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation. Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan "a regulatory jailbreak" and "a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates. The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E. The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers. The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said Bob Glynn, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E. It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system. Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20. The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters. PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour. But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of "serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers. Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny. Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law. 'FIRE SALE PRICES' "PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan," Cohen said. "PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation," said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. PG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission. Tremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company. PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs. The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets. They point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was "undervalued in today's market" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction. The PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers. SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors. 
 Jean:  We're on the job, trying to get the number.  It's a little tricky, though (you know how newly-created bureaucracies can be).  We'll get back to you soon as we have something.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much.  Really appreciate your help. 
 Thanks very much for dinner, the guacamole and the company.  I left you a check for the truck window work on the kitchen counter.  (That was the best dinner I've ever had in my entire life!  kidding! :)  )  Hope that you're not getting beat up by your bomb-throwing colleagues.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's my take.  Slash away at will.  Sue, saw your notes, but didn't try to incorporate.  You should add anything I've missed, got wrong, etc.  Pulled it together quickly.  Hope there aren't too many errors.  And hope it helps.  Best, Jeff 
 Sounds like a good outcome.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 We did recommend using the DJ index.  But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the "ARM" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.  Is that right Sue?  However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we "withdrew" the DJ index recommendation.  Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.  I think that's how things currently stand.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:  No attribution to Enron specifically No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc. If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.  We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.  More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).  I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

 FYI.  Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. "We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous," Soderberg said. No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January. 
 Davis devises new borrowing plan His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. "That is one scenario," Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. "There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced." Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. "I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great," Lynch said. "But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things." The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income.

 Thanks very much again for getting the truck window fixed.  I left a check on the kitchen counter.  Best, Jeff 
 What's your zip at home in Napa? 
 Steve:  the decision we talked about yesterday is to cover DWR costs for the period Jan. '01-Dec' 02.  Recall that SDG&E did not get the rate increases that PG&E and Edison got.  The charge (I believe) is $14.6/Mwh on a system ave. basis.  If there's anything else you need, let me know.  This decision does not deal with the "undercollection" SDG&E has accrued due to the price cap put in place by previous Legislation.  Best, Jeff 
 don't worry about it.  i'm just sending the check now.  whenever you get the wine is fine.  and thanks again for doing it. 
 Yes.  And she handed out last time's mid-term.  It was take home at that time, though.  It's open book; we have the whole time, but she said it should take about 90 minutes (which means that it will take me the whole time).  You want me to fax it to you?  Check the website first. It may be posted there. 
 I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  Your a good lawyer; do you think he can end run the Legislature and the PUC and put the rate agreement in place?  The plot continues to thicken, that's for sure.  Best, Jeff 
 Put who up for sale?  Coastal?  Really?  Why? 
 just faxed it. 
 What's the date again? 
 given the mess out here, and how long it's been going on, howzabout "deep therapy?" 
 FYI.  Unless I hear from you, I'm telling Hap that it's fine.  Best, Jeff 
 In case you hadn't seen it.  <http://www.capowerauthority.ca.gov/MediaRelease/PR01%20005.pdf>

 Ms Denne, at Enron, we use the more polite form, "deep doo-doo." 
 On a more serious note (notes).  Sue's out sick today (caught something in Houston, it seems). And seriously, I hope the meeting went well. 
 Boy, you are on fire today!  Glad you think so highly of me????  I give the goldfish two weeks...  deep fried.

 Luca Kaufman, who else?  (What did you say the price was?  The fact that it only goes to end of '02 is at least somewhat encouraging.)  You know, I'm starting to feel like tom hanks in "you've got mail."  guess that makes you meg ryan. 
 yeah, that was him.  beginning of the movie.  they notified the corleone family with the message, "luca brazzie sleeps with the fishes."  great movie.

 Hey, I'm now freed-up on Thursday, so if you want to do the gas panel on Thursday, that's fine with me.  Best, Jeff 
 Craver will head up any of these specific deals that Edison enters into.  I've known Fielder for a long time (very much the company guy, but pretty easy to work with).  I've met Craver, but don't know him as well as Fielder.  Won't be a stretch to get a meeting with Craver if we choose to do it.  Edison is the counterparty.  Regarding the credit issue, in addition to Edison, we should also view the California PUC as a "co-counterparty" to just about anything Edison does over the next 24 months or so.  Best, Jeff 
 Can you forward the decision regarding Davis' contract grab that came on the call the other day?  Thanks.  Jeff 
 In addition, though we are still attempting to confirm, it appears that no windfall profits tax bills will make it through the Legislature.  Will report back as soon as we know one way or the other.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. Put another call into Bloom.  I'm sure he'll get back to me soon, but you know how busy these important lawyers are...  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  See highlighted comments below.  Don't know if you've heard, but there's considerable talk about Davis trying to get the bonds out via Executive Order.  How that might work technically is unclear---at the end of the day, Lynch & Co. have to approve any ratepayer funds used to service the bonds.  Perhaps Davis is thinking about shifting the burden to taxpayers generally.  In off line conversations with JP Morgan people, they're saying the Executive Order route is "doable," but they ain't giving any details.  We're trying to find out more. Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearings Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal. The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas & Electric. At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis. Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November. The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates. Consumer groups, led by the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt. Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions. In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt. Michael Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan. "There is $400 million at stake here," Shames said. SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt. A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan. Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis. Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be "just and reasonable." The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said. "If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family," Lynch said. She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them from the long-term power contracts.

 I'm getting my suntan lotion and heading down there.... 
 Interesting.  What right does the PG&E creditor committee have to either 1) ask PG&E whether it's begun talks--informal or otherwise--with the PUC, and/or 2) request that PG&E begin talks?  I'm assuming that there may be some chance for #1, but very little, if any, for #2.  Thanks. Best, Jeff Edison pact could point way for PG&E The multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state. It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation. The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC, one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony, briefs and hearings. Along with its statewide impacts, which may not fully unfold for years, the settlement with the state's second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers, who will pay billions to retire its debts. One week after a federal judge approved the $6.35 billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers. From the start, the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement. It was negotiated in secret, approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward, even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved. "It's definitely ambiguously worded," said Steve Linsey, a supervisor in the PUC's semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates. On his first review of the deal, he thought about $1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates. But that figure will be at least $3.3 billion and probably higher, according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC. "There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers," Linsey said. The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers. In addition, the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers' rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts, bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers. And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edison's finances, sweeping in old debts and cash on hand, and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $6.35 billion in debts. About three-fourths of that amount -- $4.9 billion -- appears to come from the utility's customers. Edison's investors will pick up $1.5 billion -- $1.2 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years, and $300 million as a company contribution. The clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a $3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills, probably through the end of 2003. But that's not their only contribution. Another $1.6 billion would come from Edison's cash on hand, which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers. "In the end, you're right, the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers," said Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of external affairs. But if Edison had won its suit, Bennett said, it would have been entitled to the full $6.35 billion, without its shareholders taking any hit at all. No one can know who would have won the Edison suit. Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments. So why did the PUC, after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail, chose to settle? Partly, the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired, said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas. But he and others said there was another, looming fear. The PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan, filed Sept. 20, called for shifting utility assets, including the company's hydroelectric plants, nuclear plant, and gas storage and pipeline network, to a firm free from state regulation. "People's calculus was shaken up by what PG&E did," said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. "It was just in the ether that 'oh God, there's something really ugly out there. We don't think they can get away with it, but we're not entirely sure.'" The reorganization plan would leave a new PG&E company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce. That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PG&E and Edison. They plan to fight PG&E's efforts, and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated. "They could say, 'judge, you don't have to do this bad deal that PG&E wants. We can work it out,'" said Randy Chinn, an adviser to state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey. For its part, PG&E maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal. But now, the utility said, it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan. PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utility's efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge, PG&E will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution. "I think it would be smarter to be talking now," he said. A PG&E rescue wouldn't follow the Edison settlement exactly because PG&E's debts and costs are higher, Cohen said, but the PUC's goal would be the same goal it held for Edison: a healthy, regulated utility. Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation. A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the Edison settlement. "We finally got to the point where we said look, we've seen the alternatives, and the alternatives are something like what PG&E is trying to do, or having the state take over the business of buying power," Cohen said. Most people at the commission, he said, concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January. Cohen, who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations, said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing. Bilas said if it had leaked, so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed. At a closed session before approving it, he said, every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process, full information and proper hearings. It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow. Bilas, Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them. But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner. "It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this," said Florio, the consumer advocate. "This could be the beginning of something really ugly." In addition, if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures, a flurry of suits could follow, said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates' Office. 
 Recognizing that it was Sue's idea (though I'm not sure, Sue, if you're referring to the DJ index or the bottoms-up approach), isn't it also true that Harry submitted some testimony more recently regarding the DJ index method, and didn't ARM more recently submit some bottoms-up testimony, comments, etc.?  Best, Jeff 
  Steve I haven't opened these, but let me know if this is the stuff.  Jeff 
 I'll have folks get those and forward them. Be back to you soon.  Jeff 
 I think that we should pursue both.  If we can convince the PUC that it's a good deal, and that it ought to include a dedicated rate component to cover it.  If the PUC agrees, then the rate component should cover PG&E's concern and they should be able to go forward.  Thoughts? 
 Thank you. 
 You getting these?  You care? 
 Hi Doug: Hope all is well.  Congratulations to you folks on your agreement with the PUC.  Must be a relief.  I was writing to get your reaction to the judge's proposed order in the El Paso case.  You think the Commission is likely to adopt it?  Change it?  Judge's proposal fatally flawed on the market power issue?  Appreciate your insights.  AND did you hear Bilas issued the our gas settlement as his proposed decision for adoption by the Commission at its 10.25.01 meeting!?!?!  What next?  Best, Jeff 
 Playboy Online staff cutbacks  Playboy Enterprises  plans to cut about a third of the jobs in its online division, according to the Wall Street Journal. As part of a company streamlining, a spokeswoman for the media company said 44 jobs are being eliminated in its online unit. Playboy Online had revenue of $13.1 million in the first six months of the year, and counts 95,000 paying subscribers to its service. "We're not a particularly ad-driven company, but we can look at the financial outlook as well as the next person, and we look at the economy and want to make sure we can weather it well," the spokeswoman told the Journal. 
 Greetings: I'm the only one who hasn't left yet for the dome.  If it's OK with you, I'd like to come by and pick up Annie.  Likely get there around 7:30.  That work for you? 
 I thought you'd never ask.  But, please, nothing special.  You know me.  I'm a Woodbridge kinda guy.... 
 Thanks for the reply.  Agree the settlement is not nearly all that it could have been, but sure beats what we've got, it seems. If there's something you think that we can do to help in the GCIM case, please let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Can't wait (smarty pants).  See you soon.  Thanks for the invite.  You'll be happy to know, Atlanta won.  Swept those pesky Astros in 3.  Best, Jeff 
 OK, dude.  Now that I'm a full-fledged slacker, please tell me how much you need us to contribute for the weekend, which I'll add on to the $65 you paid for the guitar.  If I'm missing any other expenses, please let me know and tack them on.  It was alot of fun.  Thanks so much for inviting us.  Best, Jeff 
 I said on this AM's call that today is the deadline for Davis to sign or veto bills. That was not entirely correct. That deadline applies only to so-called "regular session" bills. The bill in question (SB18XX--Burton) was passed as part of the Legislature's "emergency," or "special," session. Apparently, "emergency session" bills do not fall under the October 15th deadline. Davis has nonetheless said he intends to veto the bill, though the pressure to renegotiate the contracts is increasing from all sides. We'll report back on signing deadlines for bills passed on as part of the "emergency" session. Bottom line: Today's deadline for regular session bills does not apply to SB18xx, or to other emergency session bills.  Best, Jeff 
 It's safer there. 
 Doesn't this constitute a change in Edison's position, i.e., I thought they'd indicated that everyone would be paid by end of Q1'03.  Now it appears they're saying that suppliers will get paid by year-end '03.  Am I missing something?  Thanks for the info.  Best, Jeff 
 Hap:  Let's discuss further, but my reaction is that, while we don't need to--and shouldn't--actively and openly support John's letter, I don't believe that we should do anything to oppose, or prevent, John from releasing it.  Do you have particular concerns? I'll call you to discuss further.  Best, Jeff 
 Were you on call this morning?  It was pretty interesting.  If you weren't on, I'd like to discuss a couple of topics that came up.  Best, Jeff 
 That's fine.  Not critical.  Jeff 
 Thanks. 
 No problem. 
 Greetings Ms Ryall:  Wondering if you ever managed to get a hold of Ms Doll.  No rush, no panic.  Just want to keep the ball rolling.  Thanks again for all your help.  Best, Jeff 
 It was really fun.  Thanks so much for inviting us.  It was great to get to play together.  I'll get Scott a check for our share of the goodies.  Thanks again.  Best, Jeff 
  Greetings: Could I get an electronic copy of your request to the CPUC to extend Gas Accord until 2005?  You think they'll approve?  When are comments due?  We want to support you.  Best, Jeff 
 Yeah.  Ask me how happy I am to be back at work, with a midterm in finance tomorrow nite. Sigh...  Tried to call you guys yesterday to see if you wanted to stop by your folks to have abalone, but only got your voicemail.  I'm sure you were glad just to get home and relax. 
 Sounds good.  No rush, though.  If she's not in till the 22nd, we have some time to plan.  Best, Jeff 
 John Wayne at his spookiest.  4 stars. 
 FYI.  Update on windfall profits bills. 
 This work for you?  Lemme know.  Best, Jeff 
 On another "food for thought" note.  Eldon and Nancy:  Here's the WSJ editorial by Scott Simon--long-time NPR dude, credentialed lib, and Quaker--on "just wars."  Sort of thought-provoking.  Best, Jeff  October 11, 2001 Commentary Even Pacifists Must Support This War  By Scott Simon, the host of National Public Radio's "Weekend Edition With Scott Simon."  Pacifists often commit the same mistake as generals: They prepare for the last war, not the next one. Many of the peace activists I have seen trying to rouse opposition to today's war against terrorism remind me of a Halloween parade. They put on old, familiar-looking protest masks -- against American imperialism, oppression and violence -- that bear no resemblance to the real demons haunting us now.  Pacifism has never been exactly popular. But when I became a Quaker as an adolescent in the late 1960s, pacifism seemed to offer a compelling alternative to the perpetuity of brute force. Mahatma Gandhi had overthrown an empire and Martin Luther King had overturned a racial tyranny with nonviolent marches, fasts, and boycotts that were nervy, ennobling and effective. Pacifism seemed to offer a chance for survival to a generation that had been stunted by the fear of nuclear extinction.  I worked as a war reporter, but I never saw a conflict between this and being a Quaker. If my reporting was sometimes drawn more to human details than to the box-score kind of war coverage, those details struck me as critical to explaining war. I never covered a conflict -- whether in Central America, the Caribbean, Africa or the Middle East -- that seriously shook my religious convictions. In fact, most conflicts seemed to prove how war was rotten, wasteful and useless. El Salvador's civil war killed 70,000 people over nine years. It was hard to see how the political compromise that ended the conflict could not have been reached after just six months. But in the 1990s, I covered the Balkans. In Sarajevo, Srebrenica, and Kosovo, I confronted the logical flaw (or perhaps I should say the fatal flaw) of nonviolent resistance: All the best people can be killed by all the worst ones. I had never believed that pacifism had all the answers; neither does militarism. About half of all draft age Quakers enlisted in World War II, believing that whatever wisdom pacifism had to give the world, it could not defeat the murderous schemes of Adolf Hitler and his cohorts.  It seems to me that in confronting the forces that attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, American pacifists have no sane alternative now but to support war. I don't consider this reprisal or revenge, but self-defense: protecting the world from further attacks by destroying those who would launch them.  Some peace activists, their judgment still hobbled by shock, seem to believe that the attacks against New York and Washington were natural disasters: terrible, unpredictable whirlwinds that struck once and will not reoccur.  This is wrong. We know now that there has been an ongoing violent campaign aimed at bringing down diverse nations, with none being more gloriously speckled than the U.S. People who try to hold certain American policies or culture responsible are trying to decorate the crimes of psychotics with synthetic political significance.  In 1933 the Oxford Student Union conducted a famous debate over whether it was moral for Britons to fight for king and country. The exquisite intellects of that leading university reviewed the many ways in which British colonialism exploited and oppressed the world. They cited the ways in which vengeful demands made of Germany in the wake of World War I had helped to kindle nationalism and fascism. They saw no moral difference between Western colonialism and world fascism. The Oxford Union ended that debate with this famous proclamation: "Resolved, that we will in no circumstances fight for king and country."  Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival. Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.  In short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.  And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace? Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept? Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?  Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness. Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy. Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler. Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.  But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent. Only American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes. Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways. And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible. It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them. 
 Wait.  You mean that the first time you've seen John Wayne in a movie, or John Wayne being spooky? 
 u aware of whalley meeting this pm re: settle SCE claims?  jeff 
 rent "true grit."  very cool. I highly recommend--from a great coming-of-age girl's novel.  also try "wake of the red witch."  and, of course, "stagecoach." 
 FYI.  Some interesting tid-bits from CMTA. 
 tribolet didn't know about it.  might just be the "small" whalley group. I'll chk back with calger tomorrow am to see.  jeff 
 I'm still in for golf if you are.  I'll bring some knitting in case you decide to bail... 
 Talked at length with Mark Baldwin today.  Could you give me a call when you get a chance to discuss?  Thanks.  Best, Jeff  415.782.7822 
 hey LOL: please tell leeeen that you're faxing it.  thanks.  AY 
 Hi Jane:  I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's "windows," it will be interesting to see how this works out.  Best, Jeff 
 Burbank's the ticket.  Can you get there direct?  If not, let's do LAX, but Burbank is preferrable.  Less of a zoo.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Glen: Two things.  1) If you'd like me to join in on the call on Wednesday to determine what TW should do regarding the re-surfacing of the SoCal settlement, I'd be happy to join.  Just let me know.  2) Are you going to the SoCal "no more windows" meeting on Thursday?  I'd planned to go but it looks like I might have a conflict now.  I'd like to get a copy of anything they hand out at the meeting.  And if anyone provides any summaries, that would also be useful.  Let me know if you plan to attend.  If you don't, know sweat.  Best, Jeff 
   Hi Evie:  Two quick things:  1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing anything?  2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.  Hope (all things considered) you're doing well.  Best, Jeff 
 thanks. 
 check's in the mail.  i made it an even $150.  Let me know if that works. Scala's the Eye-talian place that's kitty-korner from Willow, right?  Coming soon, this hip chef (and part owner of the Willow) is opening up a competing place right across the street from Willow.  Should be interesting.  We gotta dive again before the season's out. (If I can find the freakin' licenses.  I'll start looking in earnest.)  Yeah, we gotta finish the job.  You take out the WTC, you gotta pay.  Best, Jeff 
 Forgive me.  Can't recall if I already responded. Not sure if there's a simple, concise summary ("concise" just doesn't seem compatible with CA's siting process), but let me do a little poking around and get back to you.  Best, Jef 
 Thanks very much.  I was looking forward to meeting you as well.  I plan on coming to Houston soon, and I'll look you up when I'm there.  Best, Jeff 
 Just give a call when you get a chance.  I'm in.  415.782.7822.  Best, Jeff 
 Well, I guess my good friend Jerry's a little to busy these days.  I'm going to contact another lawyer who represents some big QFs and then loop back with Jerry.  Best, Jeff 
 Sounds like a plan. 
 The best I've ever had in my whole entire life, anywhere in the world.  Seriously, I think the guests--including me--thought that it was fabulous. I know Prentice finished hers, so I assume she liked it.  Cameron......well, you'll have to ask her.  The mango chutney combined with the curry was, like, death raging, man.  Best, Jeff 
 I think it would be great for us to have one.  Man, it's tough using that thing.  You gals sounded great from Prentice's bedroom when you were doing the final cuts.  Are we getting a copy?  Might be nice to have a copy of the "raw" tape.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Evie.  1) If someone writes a decent appeal, might you folks be interested in signing? 2) Do you have Michael's # where I can reach him tomorrow.  Sorry for the bother.  And if you'd like to hear about what we're thinking about regarding QFs, be happy to share it with you as well.  Be safe, Jeff 
 Thanks.  I think that's, well, a very aggressive view of how IOU debt and past and forward DWR costs are likely to be treated.  Be happy to discuss further if you like.  Best, Jeff 
 Just let me know. 
 left message for calger.  will call when i hear back from him. jeff 
 Missed the analyst call.  What was your take?  And you hearing that Lay's calling Edison today?  Best, Jeff 
 ditto.  got a little choked up...  best, Jeff 
 Tribolet sez he doesn't know anything about the Lay/Edison call, but he said Wanda mentioned something about it.  You may want to check in with her.  I'm still waiting to hear from Calger.  Best, Jeff 
 did you hear that commerce1 announced today that it's laying off 50% of its people?  sounds very ugly.  but i guess that means less competition for you.  best, Jeff 
 Didn't see the release.  They gonna be a softwary provider, or something? 
 In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing." The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions. Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial. In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects. Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds. Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds. The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below. If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.  Best, Jeff  "We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21 
 DWR filed comments with the California PUC today urging the Commission to adopt a July 1 suspension date. In addition, DWR takes the position that, if the Commission does not enact a July 1 retroactive suspension date, the Commission should require that all customers who went DA after July 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and DWR going-forward contracts. Customers and providers will strongly oppose DWR's proposal at the PUC.  Best, Jeff 
 Just a reminder:  Beginning tomorrow, the (formerly twice-weekly) California call will now take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT/1:30 CDT), same call-in number. Until the next legislative session starts up in January, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento, unless something specific requires their participation.  Best, Jeff 
 thank you. 
 great.  see you at 4:30 today. 
 Looks like Prentice and Nancy will be getting together in Napa to do a little bonding this weekend.  Therefore, it looks like an opportunity to golf on Saturday or Sunday (screw football).  Any takers?  (Eldon has promised not to be the score Nazi.)  Best, Jeff 
 Folks: Before filing comments on Bilas' proposal to modify our settlement with SoCal and vote it out on the 25th, I wanted to get a sense of how folks feel about it generally.  Hope all is well.  Best, Jeff 
 what stuff? 
 I'd like to keep this confidential, but someone inside PG&E's gas group (for what it's worth) told me that participants will have a choice under PG&E's proposed extension of its Gas Accord.  Either the participant can retain the capacity for the term of the extension (less the cost escalators in the original deal) or release the capacity back to PG&E with no penalty.  I'll try to confirm that this is the view among most in PG&E.  Best, Jeff 
     1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt point capacity. P.44  2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized firm RP capacity. P.45  3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate. This is the same cap that applies to SoCal.P.46  4)Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a delivery/receipt at Ferc.  5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs proposed 55 BCF. P.52 &54.  6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share of non-reliability storage service.P. 58  7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using this service and not to the Core customers.P.62  8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider. P.63  9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. P.66  10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. P. 75  11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. The PD estimates an additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be approx. $ 44.4 Million.  12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4 cents).P.83.  13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis. P.85-87  14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . P 88-100.  15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to services envisioned under the CSA. P. 103-110. 
 Yesterday, we reached agreement with the Senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to Senator Dunn's committee investigating wholesale price spikes. In return, Dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against Enron. This morning, Dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions. A story related to the deal is attached. If you have any questions, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Chris: A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday): A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim. After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter. In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution. We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.) For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs. We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC.  With respect to what else we could offer them: From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge. One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.) Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective. One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon. This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors. The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.  Hope this helps.  Best, Jeff 
 Cool.  If $150 don't cut it on the check, just let me know.  No sweat.  EVERYTHING is confidential. 
 We might be able to communicate this less formally through our lobbyists.  If it's OK, let me check with them first, and then I'll get back to you.  Sound good?  Best, Jeff 
 Ridota's a tough customer.  Very political type--knee-capper from the Wilson administration who was involved in the conflicts between Fessler and Knight, large customers and utilities, etc.  DA and Dereg done right (i.e., California never de-regulated) sound good.  May want to add the great job Davis did at locking a generation of Californians into $46 billion of contracts.  Maybe, on the energy issue, Riordin wants to look like a statesman, saying that if he were governor, he'd get everyone to the table to settle this thing once and for all--law suits, bad DWR contracts, ensuring customers have choices. 
 Greetings.  I can make it.  Is there a specific topic/agenda?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Rita:  Not sure if I did this right.  Was the idea to rank no more than 5, using 1= -5, or more the way I did it.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks. 
 Any reason in particular that you're of this view?  (I'm hoping you'll say that Edison's informed you that it might be doable.) 
 I like Saturday afternoon after your lesson, since we've got a wedding at 3 pm on Sunday to go to. 
 I think Sanders has always thought that the Reliant deal offers sufficient protections.  Not sure that Kirby and Gibb agree.  We'll have to wait and see.  Best, Jeff 
 that's what i was afraid of. i'll try again and resend.  sorry about that.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll take care of it and if there's anything we need to do, I'll let you know.  Best, Jeff 
 You got it. You're right, distribution lists are a challenge.  I'll make sure that you and these folks get on the list.  Hope all finds you well.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.  All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.  We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week) It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary. If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue). Those that do call in will conduct the call.  (Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.)  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Glen: Good call this AM.  Mike Day is in fact writing some comments on behalf of Wild Goose and there may be some interest from other folks to sign on and file jointly.  However, Mike won't have something to look at before COB tomorrow, and it's unclear at this point how many folks might sign on.  So I think it's prudent to continue drafting TW's comments.  As soon as I get something from Mike Day, I'll forward to you so you folks can review.  Best, Jeff 
 DWR can meet with us on October 22nd. This work for you folks?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Elyse: I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Hilda: I got an "out of office" reply from Elyse that mentions that you're the contact in her absense.  Please see the note below.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes. 
 FYI. 
 thank you. 
 FYI.  Today, the PG&E Corporation Board of Directors elected Dede Hapner, currently Vice President -Regulatory Relations of Pacific Gas and Electric Company, as Vice President - Special Projects, for PG&E Corporation, effectively immediately.  Dede will report to Steve Kline and will be located in the PG&E Corporation Washington D.C. office.  Karen Tomcala, currently Director, Federal Governmental and Regulatory Relations of PG&E Corporation, was elected today by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company Board to replace Dede. 
 Might be able to do Sunday morning.  Eldon's going to check and see if there's a tee time.  Will report back as the news breaks. 
 Thank very much Joseph.  Alan and Sue, I'm comfortable canceling tomorrow's call unless either of you have a burning issue to discuss.  We can start with the new arrangements beginning next Thursday, assuming that works for folks.  Best, Jeff 
 I think Sue should come down with something (I know I would).  Horowitz? Eegads. He will be relentless...  Looks like this group likes a good food fight. 
 party pooper. (i understand. always more complicated than necessary.) 
 Interesting.  Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: "I really need to get certified for diving."  Question 2: How hot is it down there?  Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to dive, is the diving good there, or is there another place (like Beliz) where the diving is supposed to be killer? 
 My consultant buddy, Tom Beach is the technical consultant for Jerry Bloom's organization, the California Cogeneration Coalition (or something like that).  About 1000 MW of cogen throughout the state.  I've tentatively set up a meeting with him for Wednesday at 11 AM.  So we can do Alcantar at 9, and Tom at 11.  That work?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Rachel:  John White asked me to contact you.  He said you could email me a copy of the letter that you and Sarah are working on regarding Carl Wood's statements about green direct access.  Is possible to get a copy emailed?  Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 Great.  Tom will get back to me to confirm that 11 AM works for him.  I'll let you know.  Best, Jeff 
 Speech apparently was not quite as sharp as recent ones, but heard the event overall was very good. 
 Hope you're well.  best, Jeff 
 Bev: Based on yesterday's conversation, we've set up a call for 2 PM California time on Friday.  Here's the call-in info.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much. 
 Tee hee.  More questions to follow.  Can't wait for the answers.... 
 interesting.  thanks. 
 FYI.  Latest info is that large customers, some QF cogens, independent storage companies, and perhaps PG&E, will be filing separate comments supporting the Bilas decision to adopt the settlement. 
 Mike Day's firm could do it, but they'll charge for the adminstrative costs necessary to file (we don't have the support necessary to file).  Does that work?  If so, I'll need to contact Mike promptly so they can get prepared to do the filing.  No word yet as to whether SoCalGas will support. 
 PS  The cost of having Day's firm file for you folks wouldn't be more than $100-200. 
 Thanks.  Sorry for the latest. Was on the road this morning. 
  good, since i don't think riordan would take me.  best,jeff 
 that sounds sweet.  if you can get tickets for me and prentice, i'm happy to pay for them.  just let me know. 
 Jeff Dasovich Enron Corp 101 California Street, Suite 1950 San Francisco, CA  94111 
 Super. Dave will get back to you with the details.  Thanks for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 Look like the stuff? 
 ditto? 
 I assume that you don' t need Mike Day to file TW's comments.  You got it covered?  Just let me know.  Jeff 415.782.7822 
 Eldon's got a 9:20 AM time on Monday morning, if you're interested.

 FYI. SoCalGas is filing in favor of the decision adopting the settlement.  Best, Jeff 
 The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch. The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers. He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1. We have started working with large customers to refute the letter. If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo.  Best, Jeff 
 Jesus, I'm on acid.  I meant Sunday morning. 
 Here is a brief summary of the latest DA proposal floating around the Senate.  The provisions could--and likely will--change.  The leader of the Senate (Burton) is still expressing opposition to DA, so its fate remains unclear.  No suspension of DA. All customers must pay Edison undercollection, whether they've been DA or not. Customers going DA must first clear any payables to DWR for power previously consumed but not full paid for. Customers going DA must pay for DWR's stranded power costs caused by the customer leaving, UNLESS DWR has a net short position, in which case there would be no stranded costs and therefore no fees. The bill allows customers to file a complaint with the PUC regarding DWR's claims of stranded costs. Customers who choose green DA power (defined as 80% renewable) will be exempt from stranded cost fees so long as green DA load does not exceed DWR's net short position. 
 We'll continue to scour the universe for it. 
 Forgive my ignorance, but I'm assuming that "related party transactions" refers to the Fastow deals? 
 I THINK this is where I'll be this week.  San Francisco:  Mon-Thur Friday:		Palm Springs at the conference I'm speaking at with EES 
 Every Monday at 10:30 AM (Houston time), which is, more or less, a company-wide call. Every Wednesday at 1:30 PM (Houston time), which is a Government Affairs-only call.  Those are it.  If there's anything else, just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm sure that by now everyone's seen the letter that Angelides sent to Loretta last Friday.  If you haven't, let me know and I'll have it faxed to you.  In short, Angelides blames all of the financial woes of the State on Loretta and the PUC.  Specifically, he claims that by allowing DA sign-ups to extend to September 20th, the PUC may have shifted over $8 billion to "homeowners, small businesses, and other enterprises..."  Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.  The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.  To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.  In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:  Angelides is all wet--DA and "fairness" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis. Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.  Folks may have other points to make.  Seems that we'd want to keep the letter short and to the point, however.  A letter might be useful in order to 1) give Loretta some support and 2) get some counter-press in response to the Angelides tantrum.  Any thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 I'll be on. 
 FYI.  If I've missed anyone who might be interested, please forward along. Best, Jeff CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS Friday, October 19, 2001 [1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and fuel cells at [18]. [18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority (from [1]) Is the California Power Authority a dangerously out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting back some state control over electricity supplies? The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and heads of other agencies the Power Authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal to have it buy peaker output. California Energy Commission members said they are at policy odds with the Power Authority's siting plans. In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs. "The letters of intent already approved by the Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb that power given the outlook for net-short need." Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority power will be via contract, not the spot market. "Selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky," said Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in limbo and the California Independent System Operator is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order, and an Assembly investigation might jeopardize that [J.A. Savage]. [ 
 10-ish percent. 
 FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy. Best, Jeff CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers. Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority. 
 Barry:  Good to meet you last week.  I'm out of the office until Monday, but will get on this as soon as I return.  Of this group, Dynegy is involved in the State Senate's investigation.  Best, Jeff 
 This is the last straw:  Peace just called to thank us for resolving the contempt issue.  He then went on ad nauseum--and I mean nauseum--about just about everything in the world.  Unreal.  I told him that in exchange, we expected him to get rid of Bill Lockyear.  Richard:  He complained a little about Kirby.  I told him Kirby was worth his weight in gold.  Best, Jeff 
 You get a hold of Bob Williams? 
 Hey, I was wrong. I went back and checked.  DA got as high as about 16% of total load in May 2000.  On January 1 (contracry to Herr Angelides' letter), DA was about 7.3% of load.  On February 1 it was 3.5%.  Best, Jeff 
 this is true.  good point. 
 FYI.  Here's a note I sent to the large customers.  Have spoken with them since.  They are going to write a nasty letter in response to Angelides.  Also, it does not appear that the PUC can act at this meeting on the retroactivity issue--appears that due process/notice requirements prevents it.  We're double checking to make sure.  Best, Jeff 
 congratulations.  just more evidence that regulation moves with lightening speed! 
 I'd like to do everything but the decking for the deck.  We can hold off on that.  In addition, I may have some "salvaged" redwood decking I may want to add to the mix once I get ready to install the decking.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the cc.  Nice touch.  Chalk up another one for the good guys.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Please keep confidential and do not circulate.  This is just the first draft of a letter we're working with the large customers on in response the Angelides tantrum.  Only the large customers will sign, however.  I'll forward the final when they've completed it	.  Sue's working on ARM to do something akin from the suppliers side.  Best, Jeff 
 Great question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to Loretta and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.  On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.  But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.  Let me know if you'd like me to find out if Loretta thinks the letter would help her. Could find that out in pretty short order.  Best, Jeff 
 CONFIDENTIAL. Please don't distribute.  Evie's concerned that this letter might not be welcomed by or useful to Loretta.  I think it would be, but would be useful to have your/Loretta's views. Let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Immediately? 
 I should be able to find out something by this afternoon, or tomorrow AM at the latest.  I'll get back to you as soon as I hear something.  Jeff 
 Thank you.  I would have said "governor turkey." =20 
 give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change, modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one works.  when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK, of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other stuff.  just a thought.  i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.  best, Jeff 
 Thanks very much for the update. 
 can you email the most recent version of the QF buy-out presentation?  I want to forward it to Tom Beach (consultant to CCC) prior to Wednesday.  Thanks.  Jeff 
 Jeez, nice company.  Putting you up for 10 days at the Waldorf.  I love that neighborhood.  Anywho, I'll check those dates and get back to you. 
 Talked to someone at the PUC (and I'll be talking to additional folks over there).  Question:  Do we know what volumes through Blythe have been?  One thing that might be happening is that SoCal's restricting flows at Topock in order to ensure minimum volumes through Blythe.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Brad: I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you. 
 FYI.  I ran into Bryson last Friday.  He told me (insisted, in fact) that Edison was paying everyone in February.  He told me (insisted, again) that they would have all necessary approvals from the PUC in the next several weeks.  He said that once those approvals are in place, they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a February payment date--for everyone.  I said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain.  He was pretty firm.  He also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily, that a judge wouldn't go for it.  Did you know if Lay every talk to Bryson?  Best, Jeff 
 Quck question:  w.r.t. to the stipulation with Edison.  1) Do we care that D. Douglas will know what our claim (or proposed settlement amount is), i.e., do we prefer that Dan sign a confidentiality agreement?  2)  When we file the stipulation at the Commission, do we care that the universe will see the number, i.e., do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the Commission?  Not sure if this matters whatsoever. But it might.  Who's the person that needs to answer these questions?  Best, Jeff 
 Paul:  Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.  Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area. Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature. Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs). Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like. In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated. When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities. Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition. And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led. Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.  I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings:  Hope all's going well in your new venture (or semi-new venture at this point).  You finishing this semester? Anyway, I was reading this press account and was wondering if you new this fellow when you were at Lehman.  If so, any insights?  Sort of an interesting career path.  Say hi to your better half. Best, Jeff ************************************************************************************** California Power Authority Taps SFPUC's Berry as New CFO SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Berry will soon leave his job with San Francisco's public utility commission to head up finances for California 's newly formed power authority, which is authorized to issue $5 billion in revenue bonds. The board of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority on Friday selected Berry as its first chief financial officer. He will start in his new position in early November. The authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis, and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing California 's capacity to generate electricity . Berry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission, which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties, as well as hydroelectric power for San Francisco government operations. Berry has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service. He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds. Berry worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission. From 1985 to 1996, Berry was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority. He also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985. He helped develop the authority's first conservation program. In his new postion as CFO, Berry will earn $185,000 annually. Calls to Berry and the SFPUC seeking comment were not returned by press time. 
  Tom: Here's the presentation that we'll go over with you tomorrow. If you have any questions between now and then, just give me a call at 415.782.7822. What number should I call you at tomorrow?  Best, Jeff 
 at the all-employee meeting, someone just asked Lay if he was on crack.  broke the place up. jeff 
 Oh, great. Our next call will be from Steve Peace. 
 thanks. 
 Great questions. Some brief responses. We can discuss further tomorrow. 
 Molly gets all her picks from "The Living Guide to Picking NFL Winners" by Martha Stewart.  Note on p. 12 of this months version:  Martha shows how to make hanging planters out of the jock straps worn by the front line of the New England Patriots. 
 Kean, Kirby, Gibb, me.  Lots of fun.  Not.  Best, Jeff 
 Here it is.  It's somewhat quick, but I don' t know what your timeline is (hopefully quick).  Let me know what you think (hope you don't mind that I modified your title).  Any word from Loretta re: whether a letter from big customers would help in the fight against tantrums from Angelides?  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings.  In case Martin's interested...  Best, Jeff 
 Forget that, I'm expecting a new hanging planter for Christmas.  (Tee hee).  Kisses, Jeff 
 Thanks.  Sounds good.  Did you say that you're living out in west Marin now (one of my favorite places and old stomping grounds)?  I'm one of the many, the shameful, that's not finishing (though I'll only have one class in the Spring.  Take care.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm reporting this obvious attempt at collusion and pool-fixing to the commissioner!  Figures that the Commissioner's wife is in on it.  (Isn't that always the way it is?) 
 Well, not just any jock strap.  Maybe you could model a few and I can pick one.  Don't want it to clash with the furniture.... 
 Guess who?  Me again.  You thought about having your guy Jack (who's likely got the most juice of anyone in the group) go to the Governor and tell him to tell Angelides to knock it off and to back off?  Second, what do you think about sending the letter directly to Angelides--after all, he's the one who's being a chowder head--and cc'ing Loretta?  Third, I should be able to get you something on our view of RTOs.  Best, Jeff 
 dee-lish-ush dinner--the tart was especially yummy.  thanks very much.  by the way, was that a regular tart? 
 FYI.  Left him a message.  Will report back when we hook up.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you, O wise one.  I'm sure that Jack will thank you for preserving his fluids. 
 Dear folks: Hope all finds you well, given the circumstances.  I would very much like to go, but I continue to be embroiled in the energy mess and school has started (last year!).  Turns out I'm going to have to be in Southern California that Friday and part of Saturday for work.  I'm going to have to cancel.  If there are any charges, please let me know.  Hope to see all of you very soon.  Be safe.  Best, Jeff 
 thanks. 
 I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:  They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.  If you have any questions, let us know.  Best, Jeff 
 Apologies, don't know how in the heck I missed you on the list.  (You know just clawing and backstabbing my way to the top.)   Anywho, here's the note that I just sent.  Let me know if there's anyone else that I embarassingly missed.  Best, Jeff 
 Dan: Is this also information that you'd like to be kept apprised of.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 Wanda:  I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.  I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it.  Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our "contribution" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view?  If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the "netting" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you.  Please let Michael know that we'll be coming in business casual attire. Hope that's OK.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI. 
 Talked to Edison about getting a meeting with Craver.  They're going to get back to me.  Best, Jeff 
 Edison did not bring up the refund issue at all (doesn't mean that they won't, though).  Agree on the AB 1890 issue.  The clock stops in March of '02.  Best, Jeff 
 Jim: FYI. 
 Do we run the risk of them saying, Enron, on average your customers represented 5% of the load, therefore you owe us 5% of the undercollection, or $3B * 0.05 = $150M?  That's my biggest concern.  Thoughts? 
 Need to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:  Total debt = 6.35 B After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to. The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM. 
 Sorry I missed your call.  Thanks very much.  Wanted to make sure that I ha= d the correct copies for release.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's what I'll do.  I'll go back and look at the materials they sent us.  Maybe you could do the same, so at least we have an idea of what they'll claim our "contribution" is.  Best, Jeff 
 PS  Ask me how tired of this bleeping issue I am.  Hang in there. 
 Under Angelides flawed reasoning, shouldn't energy efficiency be outlawed, since every kilowatt saved means less money to pay DWR for the contracts and the bonds to fill the hole in the state budget?  Why pick on DA?  Best, Jeff 
 I asked Mike Day to make sure that we were kept in the distribution loop on this stuff.  Best, Jeff 
 What's your fax number? 
 thanks.  it's on its way.  i'll give you a call, or give me a call when you've had a chance to look at it.  i'll include steve swain on the fax. 
 Greetings: Thanks for talking the other day.  Quick question.  Are the minimum flows at Blythe set in the BCAP?  Presumably, SoCal's 100% at risk for the flows/dollars once they're set?  Or is there some proportionate sharing?  And what's the sharing, if any on the upside?  If I'm missing something, or don't have this right, let me know.  Best, Jeff 
 No, I don't think so.  Haley and Wil's vocabularies may expanded a bit, though.  Thanks again for  having them.  Very kind of you.  Best, Jeff  PS  You guys get all the cards. 
 Talked to Pescetti yesterday.  Prior to returning my call, he had received the information that Joe Kelliher had already been appointed to the open Republican spot, and therefore understands that there's no longer a Republican seat to run for. We had a good talk. I told him that reinstating DA was the most important energy issue facing California.  Best, Jeff 
 Could you forward the gas daily article?  Thanks.  Jeff 
 u still in DC? jeff 
 Could you make sure that whomever's doing the letter to the California Ds gets a copy to me and Sue (want to keep the family happy, don't you know).  Thanks a million.  Boy do we need the cash from that merger.  Please hurry.  Best, Jeff 
 You know what is more recently?  Reason I ask is that in the past, when volumes have been low, SoCal's had to "prop up" flows, i.e., keep a minimum at Blythe for "operational reasons" to serve San Diego (they said).  So (just to give them the benefit of the doubt), I was wondering if there might be something to that recently.  Pure speculation, but wondering if you had any info.  Because I certainly can't think of ANY other reason for their behavior.  I'm calling another PUC staffer today to discuss. In the meantime, are we continuing to make the request to SoCal for service?  Might be a good idea to keep doing that.  Best, Jeff 
 Yes.  I called him yesterday after the call and filled him in on all the details. So he's up to speed; but feel free to forward. Best, Jeff  Also, didn't want to put in the note, but I got the impression from Fielder that he's not real keen on extending the stipulation.  But I think we should push it, if for no other reason than to keep the PUC out of it. 
 u get message from tribolet. re: px credit call at 4 pm (CDT)? jeff 
 Thanks.  Laurie:  I'll assume that we'll meet at 7:45-8:00 at the front desk to coordinate a little bit?  Best, Jeff 
 You know, I ran into Martha once (literally) in Washington D.C. 
 I like it.......you first. 
 I actually did get them, it appear.  Apologies. 
 Hi Mark:  Any chance of meeting with you and the gang from DWR on Monday morning or sometime Tuesday?  Best, Jeff 
 no. body to body. 
 Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter  LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday.  The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said.  In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said.  Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said.  The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total.  According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market.  The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years.  Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices.  The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said.  The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric. 
 Nice presentation.  Look out Horowitz!!  My suggestions are attached.  Two other things:  1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it. There may be press there, and they may press you on them. 2) In place of the Jefferson quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S. Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."  Finally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.  Best, Jeff 
 Those were Rick's and Steffe's.  I was never sure where they came from and didn't use them, per se.  We can talk more about it. 
 on phone with DWR trying to get a meeting for Tycholiz.  will get on phone pronto. 
 Thanks. 
 you're such a kidder. 
 bumpy times.  gonna take alot of work to come back.  i'll fill you in some time. 
 talked to karen denne.  she saw presentation and agrees.  she's going to call sue. 
 Sweetheart, very sorry to hear.  You're in my thoughts and prayers and I ho= pe you're doing OK.  Sometimes, things just aren't very fair. =20 Best, Jeff 
 fyi.  sue's at home.  try her cell phone 415.902.4108.  best, Jeff 
 Sue's presentation. 
 And here are my comments. 
 FYI. 
 got your message.  one set of golf clubs--right-handed--is all that i'll ne= ed (well, that and about 100 golf lessons!).  thanks for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 His name is Sean Steele.  I'll have his number pronto. 
 Oops. It's Shawn, not Sean.  And here's what I got.  Shawn Steele 323-951-9000 (law office) 818-841-5210 (Rep. Party HQ) 
 Thank you. 
 Sorry about that.  I'll get back to you with some other dates. 
 Jim: Let Jeremy know that there will be some big dogs (i.e., large customers) coming out with guns a'blazin' on this and that we're working closely with them.  Also, Sue and I discussed, and we can't see any reason why we wouldn't want very long, very dragged out hearings on this.  The longer the issue drags on, the more exposed DWR will be, the greater the likelihood of DWR contract negotiation, and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to July 1.  In addition, hearings would (finally) force DWR to answer some questions---this time under oath, and possibly with the press present, which would be very beneficial--I'm talking to other folks to try to get Loretta make that happen.  Either of you see any reason why we wouldn't want to have hearings?  Best, Jeff 
 You ain't kidding.  Hope you and yours are OK, given the circumstances.  All the best. Jeff 
 Thanks very much.  I'll try to subscribe again. Hey, forgive me for being a snoop, but do you not wear glasses at all anymore?  Signed, Four eyes 
 I thought that might be the case.  Didn't want to be so bold as to bring it up, though.  You looked great with glasses.  You look great without them.  Thanks again for the email.  Best, Jeff 
 Hey, I can't find steve kelly's email.  can you forward this to him? 
 I'm not interested.  But is it more, or less, than you described? 
 which game is it? 
 you're fired. 
 Trying again.  Best, Jeff 
 Prentice will call you. 
 How do the 13th or 20th of November work? 
 You see this?  What the hell is with Cramer?   Date      October 25, 2001 Time      07:00 AM - 08:00 AM Station   CNBC Location  Network Program   The Squawk Box   Mark Haines, co-anchor:  Joe Kernen, what's going on?  Joe Kernen, co-anchor:  We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit, David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred million in revenues.  James Cramer, guest market commentator:  Maybe.  Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and...  Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the California utility system and profited from it.  That's my bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months, made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there we're going to discover this.  Kernen:  Let's see what happened...  Haines:  Now, wait a second...  David Faber, co-anchor:  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is that new?  Is that something--  Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor, something...  Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?  Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward thinking.  Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited partnership transactions of Mr.--  Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking about.  Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?  Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's yesterday's trading--  Haines:  Wait a minute.  Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now. That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that Fastow, after four--  Faber:  Late yesterday.  Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's interesting--  Faber:  He's the CFO--  Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.  Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships.  Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not on thin ice.  Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory.  Cramer:  This is my theory.  Haines:  OK.  Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred.  Haines:  OK.  Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.  Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market down.  Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and those who've left the company as investors over this last week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their investors, they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about.  Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go down, how would that affect energy trading?  Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades.  Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?  Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies, maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.  Kernen:  Now, why would--  Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.  Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right? Because of something that could unravel--  Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities they may have--  Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.  Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability? They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--  Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?  Faber:  They don't know.  Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited partners?  Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is what some analysts estimated.  Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.  Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves.  Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.  Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got hurt.  Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.  Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.  Kernen:  You are.  Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.  Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the utility average.  I've worried about the transportation average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this chart?  We're breaking below the--  Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.  Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?  Cramer:  I'm all fired up!  Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you going down to Houston yourself?  Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that whole city.  Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?  Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much stronger than before.  Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at this point.  That's a long way.  Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but I still think that--  Kernen:  It's no longer the--  Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.  # # # 
 Thanks.  Love to catch up on Tuesday when I get back, if that works for you.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks for the invite, but I have class.  She have a job yet? 
 Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.  Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.  That work?  Best, Jeff 
 I'll contact Lydia and you'll have materials well in advance of the meeting. 
  Hi Lydia:  Could you let me know what time in the afternoon of November 13th works with Brad's schedule?  Will need 60 minutes.  Thanks very much for your help.  Best, Jeff 
 It's going to be sometime in the afternoon on the 13th. 
 Nice job.  In line with your letter, and in response to Wood's questionnaire about rolling the suspension date back to July 1, don't you think it is absolutely necessary to have hearings in order to establish a record prior to any decision? Wood throws around the $10 billion number in his questionnaire (ruling, whatever), without any substantiation whatsoever.  Shouldn't DWR and its rev. req. be thoroughly scrutinized in the hearing room before making a decision.  Seems logical though 1) logic has prevailed much lately and 2) I'm not a lawyer, so I could be missing the boat completely.  Best, Jeff 
 Baldwin's secretary called.  He's going to check with DWR and get back to me tomorrow morning regarding whether Monday or Tuesday will work.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings: Unlucky you.  It's me again, calling about setting up a meeting with Ms Doll.  Any word?  Greatly appreciate your efforts.  Best, Jeff 
 No problem.  No hurry.  Whenever you've got it ready is great.  Best, Jeff 
 Jim:  Thanks for getting people together. There are (at least) 3 things going on here:  1) Coordinate PG&E/SCE 2) Edison "meet and confer" (on Monday?  sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th. 3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder's coordinating.  2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov't affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.  No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.  We have a number yet for the call?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi Bob:  Could you please leave on my voicemail the call-in number to discuss the meet and confer call that's happening with Edison?  When exactly is that meeting?  Is it California or Houston.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 I have class on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
 Let's try this.  It's all inter-related.  PG&E, the prehearing conference and our workout with Edison.  Can we have one call that you includes all who need to be involved?  (I'm thinking, Steffes, you, Tribolet, me. Mellencamp, Wanda, Sue). That make sense?  Let me know.  Easiest thing would  likely be to set up a call-in number (I'm mobile today).  Thanks alot.  Best, Jeff 
 The pleasure was all mine.  You did a fantastic job with the presentation (both developing and presenting it).  Likewise, it lifted my spirits in these challenging times to meet someone as talented (and fun!) as you.  Hope our paths cross again often.  Never hesitate to get in touch if there's anything I can do.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks to all of you for your help with this.  Made my participation practically effortless, and more important, alot of fun.  Great job.  Best, Jeff 
 Actually, I'm travelling tomorrow.  If we could do it between 8 and 9:30 AM (PST), that would work.  Otherwise, I'll need to do Wednesday if possible.  Best, Jeff 
 Horowitz never had a chance. 
 Really appreciate it.  Will you be attending? 
 Great.  Just to make sure.  I've got an address of 3310 El Camino, Suite 120. This correct?  Is there a number there in case something comes up?  Best, Jeff 
 3310 El Camino (Sacramento).  Suite 120. 
 Just sent you yahoo map/directions on how to get to DWR. 
 Hi Cynthia:  I'm not sure if I'm going about this correctly, but Joseph's out today, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I need to rent a car tomorrow Tuesday, Oct. 30 (pick up at 7:30 AM and return it on Wed. Oct. 31 at 7:30 AM (want to rent from the Hertz outlet on Mason Street in SF, which is where I always rent).  Is this something that you folks generally arrange, or do I just do it?  Is there a corporate account # I'll need if I do it?  Really appreciate your help.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks. 
 Hey, I've got a "devil" of an idea to try to keep our weekend from becoming "hellish."  Should we start emailing what we need to do/get?  I can go to Rainbow on Thursday night to get staples (understanding that there may be some speciality items that we can pick up out there, e.g., oysters, cowgirl creamery, knave of hearts bakery, etc. 
 Greetings:  The Commission denied it.  Work is underway to appeal the Commission's decision to the courts.  Sue Mara is taking the lead on this for us.  She can update you on where the appeal stands.  Be great to get you support for/participation in the appeal.  Best, Jeff 
 Sounds good.  My cell phone number is 415.505.6633. Jeff 
 Can we have chat again between now and COB Wednesday (like we did night before PG&E meeting) to get ourselves in order for the Edison meeting? 
 Obviously worth the time.  Great letter.  Thanks for sharing...  Best, Jeff  You folks gearing up to respond to Karl Woods questions regarding why the suspension should be pushed back to July 1? 
 Governor wants to cut costs of power Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- With an economic "perfect storm" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. "If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. "Good luck!" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. "This could save billions of dollars," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is "not targeting every contract" because the pacts have been "extremely valuable in keeping the market stable." The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing "perfect storm" of fiscal calamities. The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. Burton has called "for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts." The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. "We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'" said Calpine's Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be "very, very severe," but also "they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them," Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis "is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts." "Last spring," Heller said, "power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals." 
 You folks giving this to the press?  Might be useful. 
 You won't believe this.  Jerry Bloom left me a message.  Wants to talk, though I wouldn't get my hopes up.  I'll let you know what he says.  Best, Jeff 
 You have time to talk a bit more about what we were discussing on the call?  In particular, impact on the book of negotations around the PX credit calc going foward?  Jeff 
  There was a discussion on this morning's call regarding the status of PUC actions regarding DA suspension.  We requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel.  It is attached.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Sue Mara (415.782.7802) or me (415.782.7822).  Best, Jeff 
 I have a 3. I'll call at 4. 
 Thanks so much.  Really appreciate it.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  See you at 10. 
 FYI.  Suggested addressing it to Angelides, but they didn't want to "dignify" his letter.  They decided that, ultimately, Loretta's in charge, and addressed it to her.  Had a great talk with Sarah.  She's following up on a few things.  You may want to touch base with her re: hearings on DWR rev. req.  You ever received my (modest) edits to the Karl Wood letter?  Best, Jeff  PS Is that article you sent me re: bad contracts from today's papers? 
 Does this mean I shouldn't have talked to the Journal regarding my views of= merger?  Ooops.  I'll refer inquiries to you from now on....  Seriously, hope (given the circumstances) that all finds you well.  Best, Jeff 
 With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:  Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts. Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal. Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.  We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.  Best, Jeff 
 Couple of additional pieces of information:  In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward. It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.). So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter. Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions. Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.  Best, Jeff 
 Fielder's traveling today.  Left him a long message on his voicemail and asked him to get back to me as soon as he gets a chance.  Best, Jeff 
 Steve:  Been wanting to drop you a line to say, Hang in there.  You're a remarkable individual, and it's great working with you. As far as I'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around.  You can count on that.  (Now if we can just find something left to turn around.  Kidding.) If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Please give my regards to Ken.  Best, Jeff 
 agreed. 
 You take care.  If for whatever reason, there's anything I can do, please j= ust ask. =20 Best, Jeff 
 zero 
 apologies.  i don't know what those bills are....  Best, Jeff 
 Yep.  It's moving along.  The budget, and the R's desire to mess with Davis, are prolonging things a bit.  But all indications are that Loretta will hold DA until the 12th.  How'd the afternoon go?  Best, Jeff 
  FYI.  Not for dissemination outside this distribution.  Documents delivered to Hertzberg to follow.  Best, Jeff 
 Please keep this confidential and internal to the company.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Congratz.  Do we know for how long a decision will be delayed?  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Hedy. Barring any strange turn of events, we're likely to be OK with the language.  The budget--and the R's desire to mess with Davis--appear to be delaying things somewhat.  If tomorrow Loretta holds the DA decision till the 12th, that will buy some additional  (and necessary) time to work a deal.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore).  In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on.  That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited "appeals process" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.  Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as soon as I have more information on that.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  My understanding is that the decisions would actually go out prior to Aug. , with "effective date" in Aug., , thus providing time for the appeals process.  Do others have a similar or different view?  Do we intend to stay in touch, in view of the fact that there's been some "breathing room" provided by the PUC delaying its DA vote, and given the heavy lifting that is still needed to get the core/noncore agreement teed-up and through?  Happy 4th to all.  Best, Jeff 
 It's going to be extremely difficult for anyone who has consumed electricity to avoid paying for it.  It will be particularly difficult for Enron to exempt itself from costs incurred by the state on behalf of Enron's customers.  Prior to us pushing amendments on this bill, can we discuss on the 11:30 call today.  Harry and I have discussed this at length, and I just want to make sure that we don't blow up the whole enchilada by trying to get an amendment here.  Best, Jeff 
 Here's the proposal:  There is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all Davis has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the "state of emergency" put in place by Davis on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end. The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.) If, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 thanks, paul.  apologies, i dont' even remember seeing this.  leslie, can we discuss on thursday.  i  can update you on everything underway w.r.t. cal gas.  thursday work for you?  best, jeff 
 Yes. 
 8 AM. 10 AM. 3 PM.  Best, Jeff 
 Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.  Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments. Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to provide the specific language). I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll provide legislative language shortly . Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 thanks for everything.  really 'ppreciate it, 'migo.   and please thank karen, too.  also, would you tell her that prentice and i are willing and able (we think) to help out in any way we can in putting the fireplace stuff together----i.e., anything that doesn't require real skill, like sticking tiles on the board.  just let us know.  Best, Jeff   tah-mo 
 Thanks.  As you know, I'm in the negotiations.  It's the best chance there = is to 1) get a real market and 2) keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  Whether C= alifornia can execute on it is another story.  But we're trying damned hard= to make it happen.  IEP should support it.  Anything that you can do with = Jan would be useful and appreciated.  Best, Jeff 
 Greetings:  Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.  I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.  I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:  Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds.  In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.  Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.  I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.  In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.  With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.  Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?  Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.  Best, Jeff 
 yes. 
 Please take a look and see if you think it does what we're after.  I'd like to share with folks as soon as possible to try to get something in the bill.  Best, Jeff 
 Just talked to Fielder. U have 5 minutes to debrief?  Sending this to Kean/Shapiro/Steffes.  Jeff 
 i'd send to the big list.  i used to send what julie malinowski sent around. 
 Thanks for you comments.  I did this prior to the meeting w/Keeley yesterday.  I assume that, if this thing gets off the ground, we'll have the opportunity to get this thoughts into whatever it is that the legislature produces.  Best, Jeff

 you mean communicate the fact that mark views me as wholly expendable?  i'm hurt, mark.  best, jeff 
 FYI.  From today's Post.  Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts.  Best, Jeff ********************************************************************** Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr  07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. "We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. "You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion." The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. "What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. "There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. "It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room "billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said. 
 May you be forced to spend eternity with David Lazarus....  P.S. I'm taking next week off.  I'll be in the Middle East for martyr training.  Best, Jeff

"It's an issue that people act= ually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics."  De= mocrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House.= Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bus= h is handling energy and environmental issues.  What's more, the House of R= epresentatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and = gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed w= ith support from 70 Republicans.  "When the Republican-controlled House sou= ndly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an= opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center," sa= id Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn.  The decision to highlight energy policy= came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key c= ommittees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum = wage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and oth= er issues popular with their supporters.  But concentrating on energy polic= y first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican = issue and turn it to their advantage, aides said.  Bush and Vice President = Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From th= e moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energ= y needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden = to special interests.  "The White House and Republicans are in the 35 perce= nt end of public opinion on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who sp= oke on condition of anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for = the Republicans."  With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the N= ew Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources comm= ittee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. I= t will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in = May.  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as nex= t week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Departme= nt. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fendin= g off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling ne= ar Florida beaches and on national monument lands.  The White House helped = defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling bac= k its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge disagreements remain o= ver drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of = Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Inte= rior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge.  Democrats a= lso want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants= that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservati= on and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for spor= t utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel econo= my standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later thi= s month.  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle = extra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republ= icans such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Co= llins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.  Sen. John Mc= Cain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights= and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservatio= n measures than the White House proposes.  "He'll be very prominent in cobb= ling a centrist coalition on the issue," said Marshall Wittman, a senior fe= llow at the conservative Hudson Institute research center and a political a= dviser to McCain. "You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- enc= ouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environment= ally friendly."  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of it= s energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spend= ing for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He als= o has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for sp= ending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the= president is not backing away from his position that the United States nee= ds to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials= say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energ= y plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alas= kan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay f= or research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disappr= oval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing t= he sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals.

 You can send both, but I'd have folks keep it close to the vest.  Definitely want to make sure that none of our stuff ends up in the hands of the media. 
 Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.  Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.) Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend. Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU) In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th. July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc. The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.) All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process. 
 Gee, now that's a "rib"-tickler. 
 Thanks very much Mike.  The sense of urgency for getting this in "the mix" is not as high as it was yesterday, though we'll still need to introduce it at some point very soon.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff 
 nope. 
   California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel T= aub  Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray= Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electric= ity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a= misdirected e-mail.  The e-mail, containing data on California's power pur= chases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Da= vis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on= the office's press list, he said.  Davis is fighting disclosure of state p= ower purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contract= s. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market i= nvoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed= through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, w= hich are burdened by debt.  ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of= the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of t= he day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  Accord= ing to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity = for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to li= ght 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $14= 9.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accura= te.  Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a me= gawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloombe= rg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, a= ccording to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on= the day-ahead market.  The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-ma= rket purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying str= ategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legis= lators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days aft= er they are signed.  =09 
 gee, tough break. 
 Will do.  Best, Jeff 
 can we talk about this? 
 Sorry, but no. 
 Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.  The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session. The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.  The Legislature's options: 1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning. 2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a "waiver," which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning. 3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.  In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.  Where to from here? Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July. Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that "...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'" and "...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end."  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however. Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough. With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive. Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said: Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without "adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses." He doesn't know why "the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session." With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.  If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.  We'll report back with additional information as we get it.  Best, Jeff 
 USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.  07/06/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  (changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold. Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement. As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. "Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.

Best, Jeff ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Campaign funds will pay for spots Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, July 7, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport. Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an "information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis. "The campaign season has started early," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots running since June 19. Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, including three Davis opened this month, and that "conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices." Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions. South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square. "One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am mood." Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. "These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think he has any credibility on this issue." Davis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. "What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President Bush in 2004. Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." Reliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the ads running in California through July. Scott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a call for comment yesterday. Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. Davis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull dramatically increased. Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader. Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between supply and demand, except through strict conservation. "We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so far," Gillespie said. E-mail Robert Salladay at rsalladay@sfchronicle.com. ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Page A - 6 
 Apologies folks, but upon re-reading, I caught some ambiguities and inaccuracies in the first draft that I sent around.  Sure that  errors remain, but this version should at least be somewhat closer.  Changes are in strike-out-underline.  Best, Jeff 
 Called Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.  As you know, the Legislature closed without doing anything with Edison's bailout legislation.  The Governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks.  That has Fielder and everyone else at Edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks. Let's regroup.  Dave, perhaps we should just go ahead and start with PG&E. Thoughts?  Best, Jeff 
 Below is an update from the weekend's activities.  The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format. The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT). The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday). As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin. The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal. Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis. In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially. Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.  Best, Jeff 
 Since it was only Friday since Delainey directed me to send info directly to him, I included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking like I was disobeying direct orders 48 hours after receiving them.  Hopefully we can work something out where you distribute as you deem fit.  Hope it's not creating undue headaches.  Best, Jeff 
 i'll be participating.  thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Last time I was in Houston, an IT tech deleted everything---I mean everything---so I need to hunt it down.  Will do so immediately and get you a copy. Best, Jeff 
 Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help.  Best, Jeff 
 This looks like LA Times/Wall Street Journal material...... 
 Thanks.  I have minor, but substantive, edits to the direct access section that Dorothy did, which I believe more accurately capture the document that we previously delivered to Hertzberg and the discussions around that document.  My proposed edits will be distributed to everyone within the next 30-60 minutes.  Thanks to Delaney for all the work.  Best, Jeff 
 Ditto. 
 Sounds good.  How about first thing tomorrow morning for a call? 
 P.S.  Have discussed with Dorothy and will attempt to capture in my proposed edits our discussion.  Best, Jeff 
 may have been updated a bit prior to the presentation, but yep, that's it.  will do for now.  please forward to rick.  when i'm back in the office i'll do more searching.  thanks a bunch.  i'm assuming this is what he's referring to.  Best, Jeff 
 Folks: Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.  They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.  Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.  In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.  Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.  Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).  Best, Jeff 
 "Sacramento or Salem?"  Sort of has a nice ring to it. 
 No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.  Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  limit.  Thanks very much for the comments.  Best, Jeff 
 You're a saint. 
 Thanks Barbara: Dorothy just phoned me and I believe we're all squared away.  Can you call her and make sure that you're comfortable?  Best, Jeff 
 Hi:  Thanks for the wires story.  I talked to Dorothy and we're square.  If anyone tries to make any other changes, please let me know first or have them call me directly, whichever you prefer.  Thanks for all your help.  Best, Jeff 
 No comments.   And continued good luck with the process.  Best, Jeff 
 Religion, huh?  Interesting.  Your folks may disown you, though.  I don't know how you could think that cooking would be more fun than bond finance--you crazy?  The Pilot: I need to know exactly what the pilot is and with whom your doing it.  Yes, I need the champion's name, and fast.  The meetings will work, but I forgot, what week?  Next week or week after?  (May want to wait until plane service gets normal?)  Have fun in SC--why don't you guys live there?  Not a bad commute for you; Scott can surf; we can come down and play bluegrass!  Sell the flat, dammit.  Kisses, Jeff  PS Colleen doing OK?  I can come by after class on Wednesday--class is at Boalt, so we get out at 8:30, you know what slackers law students are.... 
 The Bond Legislation The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along. The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.  The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal. Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain. No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."  The Core/Noncore Legislative Language The negotiating group continues to work on the language. The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.  Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.  Best, Jeff 
 Heeeeeeeeeeeeee Haaaaaaaaaaawww!!!!!   Gouge dat taht moh! 
 It's a hell hole, whaddya think?  Be great if you stopped by.  Just let me know when you're going to be here.  Love to have dinner and catch up.  You involved at all with the gas infrastructure stuff that's going on at the Cal PUC.  If not, I think that you should be.  Now that Fawcett has left TW and Susan Scott's in our shop in Houston with Christie, I'm a little concerned about TW (I don't have as much time to monitor anymore).  Be great if you got involved.  Hope all is well with you and yours.  Best, Jeff 
 Appreciate it.  Take care.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Could you please forward to Bev?  More arrows for our quiver in trying to get out the truth.  Best, Jeff 
  California; Metro Desk Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show. RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS  07/10/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company  SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California. Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. "You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy."

 Mark, Congratulations on the story in the Times.  FYI.  Today's radio media (local and national) are all giving the same basic message that:  "Davis got beat up in FERC negotiations; judge sides decidedly with generators; Davis team trying in vain to spin it their way, but it's clear they lost. "  Freeman was pathetic on the radio this morning.  Interviewers weren't buying his BS at all.  Best, Jeff 
 Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments:  Under the definition of "Spot Market Service" it now reads:  This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service.  I don't understand the meaning of the phrase "or be deemed to elect."  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.  There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term. Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a "zone of comfort" around including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted to briefly flag it).  Thanks again for all the effort.  Best, Jeff 
 any sense of why all the pulling? 
 Found the final.  Don't know if it differs from the one distributed yesterday.  Best, Jeff

State reveals high-priced power deals=20 By Dale Kasler and Chris Bowman Bee Staff Writers (Published July 10, 2001)=20 The state Monday released details of its adventures in buying electricity o= n the spot market, revealing a chaotic world in which prices fluctuate wild= ly within minutes.=20 The Department of Water Resources, which has been criticized for keeping it= s power-purchasing practices a secret, released 1,770 pages of invoices and= trade confirmations that provided the most detailed look yet of its purcha= ses since it jumped into the energy-buying business Jan. 17. The informatio= n was released a week after state Controller Kathleen Connell put out detai= ls of the state's long-term power contracts over the objections of Gov. Gra= y Davis, her political nemesis.=20 The state has committed about $8.1 billion to buying power on behalf of Cal= ifornia's crippled utilities, straining the budget surplus and raising ques= tions from lawmakers and others about Davis' policies for resolving the sta= te's energy crisis. In turn, state officials have accused many suppliers of= gouging California to the tune of several billion dollars.=20 When it came to the spot market, the water department was at the mercy of a= business run amok. The state paid upward of $300 a megawatt-hour for days = in January and February -- months when electricity normally should be a lot= cheaper. Water officials said prices have dropped to the $100 range largel= y because they've signed a slew of long-term contracts, reducing their depe= ndence on spot sales.=20 "Our exposure earlier this year to the spot market was at the maximum," sai= d Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the water department.=20 The information released Monday covered the first three months of the year = and didn't include the highest price the water department has paid for elec= tricity: $1,900 a megawatt-hour in May to Reliant Energy Inc., a Texas gene= rator that owns several plants in the state. Duke Energy Corp. of North Car= olina charged even more for power in January, $3,880 a megawatt hour, but t= hat sale was made to the Independent System Operator, which runs the state'= s transmission grid.=20 The documents show that while the state's stricken utilities no longer buy = power for themselves, their sister companies have sold expensive power.=20 Through May 31, the state paid a trading arm of Sempra Energy, the parent o= f San Diego Gas & Electric, some $429 million for power. It paid PG&E Energ= y Trading, an unregulated sister company of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a= bout $23.7 million.=20 Among others, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was paid $331 m= illion through May 31; Canadian utility BC Hydro was paid $1.05 billion; At= lanta's Mirant Corp. $1.24 billion; the federal government's Bonne=07ville = Power Administration $167 million; and the Sacramento Municipal Utility Dis= trict $80.7 million.=20 Generally, the more desperate the state was for power, the higher the price= s.

M= uniz is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential.=20 "With the cost of electricity going up, you can start looking at it as a bu= siness decision, just investing your money," said Muniz. "There's virtually= no maintenance on this equipment. It just sits on your roof and converts r= ight into electricity that you're using as soon as you generate it.

"Certainly (counties) stepped up to the plate when they we= re asked to increase conservation efforts. They've done about as much as hu= manly possible."=20 Kings County leaders thought they made a great deal in 1992 when they signe= d up for Southern California Edison's interruptible load program, which pro= mises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down electrica= l services in times of shortage.=20 Then California's power crisis hit full-force this year.

Energy talks reach no settlement; state threatens suit        By Mark Sh= erman ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON - With talks between the = state and power generators stalled, California may go to court to help win = the $8.9 billion state officials believe it was overcharged for electricity= .  "I think we have demonstrated very clearly both to the FERC and to the j= udge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and will settle for nothing less,"= said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.  With negotiations at= an impasse, the administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory= Commission said California is probably owed no more than $1 billion in ref= unds.    "The numbers were too far apart," said Curtis Wagner, the FERC chi= ef administrative law judge.  California, Wagner said, may receive nothing = at all, because generators may be owed more than they have to return for an= y overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the state at between $716 millio= n and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $716 million as part of an ov= erall settlement, while California state officials sought $8.9 billion, Wag= ner said.  He said California officials had not made the case for $8.9 bill= ion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the state would go to court and may= ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split off claims of overcharges f= rom the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had time to consider those all= egations under the short timetable ordered by FERC last month.  Wagner serv= ed as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiations and will recommend a se= ttlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission ordered the talks last mont= h in an effort to resolve differences between producers and the state over = the breakdown of California's deregulated electricity market.  Consumer adv= ocates assailed the judge's recommendation and urged the state to continue = its attempt to get refunds from what they say are profiteering power compan= ies.  "It's like catching a bank robber, but instead of making him give bac= k all of it, you only make him give back 5 percent of what he stole," said = Douglas Heller, spokesman for the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpaye= r and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, however, were generally pleased w= ith Wagner's comments.  Brent Bailey, general counsel for Duke Energy, said= even if the formula Wagner recommends produces $1.5 billion in refunds, "t= hat's a reasonable amount in the context of these settlement talks."  Calif= ornia officials, negotiating on behalf of utilities, the Public Utilities C= ommission and state power buyers, accused the producers of manipulating sup= ply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers have acknowledged prices ar= e high, but blame jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power= plants, and the workings of the free market.  The bill for wholesale power= in California soared to $27 billion last year from $7 billion the year bef= ore. Davis has estimated the state could spend as much as $50 billion this = year.  The producers reiterated Monday that California's numbers are grossl= y inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators - Duke Energy, Dynegy, = Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos. - said in a statement that the= y have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  Reliant would ag= ree to no more than $50 million in refunds as part of an overall settlement= that also would have to include protection from additional legal claims, s= aid John H. Stout, a company senior vice president.  But Stout also said, "= Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains that no refunds are jus= tified."              Refunds in jeopardy as talks fail        Judge sees p= ossibility of offsets equal to the billions sought by state By Toby Eckert = COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  July 10, 2001  WASHINGTON -- Settlement talks between= California and power providers accused of electricity price gouging collap= sed yesterday, and the judge who will now hand the case over to federal reg= ulators set a course far from favorable to the state's demand for $8.9 bill= ion in refunds.  "There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of = dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief administr= ative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previ= ewing the recommendations he will make to the commission.  But Wagner, who = mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are still owed sums f= or electricity "that probably are higher than any overcharges" for which th= ey may have to pay refunds.  That opened the possibility that California co= uld see no cash refunds, only a reduction in the billions of dollars the po= wer generators and marketers claim they are owed by state entities and util= ities.  Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a "fast-track hearing= " to try to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising= from California's power crisis.  Wagner also outlined a method that he sai= d FERC should use for calculating refunds.  While his proposed formula incl= udes part of one method the state used, it contains several elements for ca= lculating electricity costs that were favored by power sellers, who maintai= n that California's numbers are wildly exaggerated.  "I would suspect that = would result in a number much below $8.9 billion," said Joe Ronan, vice pre= sident of Calpine, a San Jose-based electricity generator. "I think (Wagner= 's method) reflects more accurately what actually happened" in the state's = dysfunctional power market.  But Michael Kahn, the state's lead negotiator,= said Wagner "vindicated" California's core arguments.  "The hundreds of pe= ople who came here on the other side had argued to the mediator that there = should not be any refunds, and that position was loudly rejected," said Kah= n, chairman of the organization that manages most of California's power gri= d.  "We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be = in the multiple billions. Whatever amount of money . . . is awarded to us, = we will have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the r= emainder. So what we have here is a situation where California will get its= $8.9 billion."  Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation r= emains worrisome to them. They sought an end to investigations of their con= duct, and immunity from legal action as part of their bargaining position. = During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowhe= re near bridging their differences. Wagner said a number of power sellers h= ad put forward offers that totaled $716.1 million.  "That's a long way from= splitting the difference," he said. "In 15 days, you can't work miracles."= Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will betwee= n the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the pr= eviously closed hearings.  Each side essentially accused the other of barga= ining in bad faith and failing to put forward realistic proposals.  John H.= Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, said the= state used "biased calculations" to arrive at its $8.9 billion refund dema= nd. He also said that Reliant offered to knock $50 million off the $300 mil= lion it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state.  Kahn shot b= ack that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and never approach= ed the state.  Figures scrutinized "This is the first time we've heard any = of this information. And to give the impression that somehow there's been c= ooperation or forthcomingness, I think is misleading," Kahn said.  The stat= e's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talks.  The = $8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid opera= tor of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period when= wholesale power prices soared.  Kahn said the figure was essentially dupli= cated when the state went back and calculated what power costs would have b= een if a pricing method instituted by FERC last month had been in effect fo= r the entire yearlong period.  FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to = tame wholesale prices in the West.  In a partial win for the state, Wagner = said he would recommend that FERC use the order retroactively as a basis fo= r calculating refunds, an approach resisted by the power sellers.  But he s= aid that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October 2000, an= d should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are calcula= ted.  For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas= heat it takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market pr= ices in Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rath= er than a statewide average cost, computed monthly.  Fewer overcharges? Tho= se and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could incre= ase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of over= charges.  Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to Octobe= r would put about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.  Brent= Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy North America, = said, "We think (Wagner's) modifications are certainly a vast improvement o= ver FERC's June 19 order and also certainly over (the state's) model."  Ame= rica.  In Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis issued a statement characterizing the= electricity suppliers as pirates who refused to negotiate in good faith.  = "While in the past the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers= , they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 = billion California has demonstrated it is owed," Davis said.  Despite the h= arsh rhetoric, both sides indicated that they would continue trying to reac= h one-on-one settlements.  Ronan of Calpine said the generator was close to= making a deal with the state. Bailey said that while Duke would continue t= o push for a "global settlement" between all the parties, "We've had seriou= s settlement talks with the state over the last few days and hope to contin= ue."               State's massive outlays detailed        Energy bill exce= eded $100 million on 3 days By Jennifer Coleman  ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10,= 2001  SACRAMENTO -- On three days in May, California's daily power spendin= g topped $100 million, according to a report released yesterday by state po= wer traders.  The California Department of Water Resources report, which ad= dressed spot market electricity purchases since January, was released along= with 1,770 pages of documents that specifically detailed the first three m= onths of last-minute power purchases.  Such power buys on the spot market t= ypically get the most expensive electricity available.  The report details = the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took ov= er electricity purchases for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., San Diego Gas & = Electric Co., and Southern California Edison.  The utilities had amassed bi= llions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. S= ince then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  Th= e state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highes= t daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million. The day befo= re, the state spent $100 million.  But since May, spot market prices have d= ropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower natural gas prices, increase= d conservation which lowered demand and because of increased scrutiny by la= wmakers and investigators into possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray Davis= has said long-term contracts also drove the price down.  "It does look lik= e some of the spot market prices have gone down, but it looks like it's pri= marily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis, spokesman for Assembl= y Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot market prices "underscores que= stions about the strategy of locking us into long-term contracts, if natura= l gas prices continue to drop," Fisfis said.  Most of the long-term contrac= ts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 years.  "It's unfortunate that= it looks like we'll never get out from under these contracts," Fisfis said= .  Davis has already released details of the state's long-term power contra= cts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several new= s organizations, including The Associated Press and The Copley Press, which= publishes The San Diego Union-Tribune.  Davis released copies of those con= tracts, but wanted to delay the release of the spot market buys and short-t= erm contracts. Releasing those details too soon after the purchases would r= eveal the state's buying strategy and could cause generators to raise their= already sky-high prices, Davis said.  The number of spot market buys will = lessen, the Davis administration says, as more long-term contracts are sign= ed, reducing the state's exposure to the high-priced purchases.  The govern= or's office will release future short-term contracts and spot market buys w= ill be released on a quarterly basis, with a 90-day lag time. Second quarte= r information will be released in October and third quarter documents will = be available in January.  Davis maintains the delay is needed to protect it= s ability to negotiate further spot-market power buys.  According to the wa= ter department, Canadian Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro, has been p= aid $1.05 billion for spot market purchases as of May 31.  But Atlanta-base= d Mirant Corp. topped that list, getting $1.24 billion as of the end of May= .  The newly released short-term contracts also show what the state had to = pay when it needed power the most.  On March 19 and 20, when rolling blacko= uts hit California again, the state was forced into paying above-average pr= ices in its largest short-term contracts.  For example, Mirant sold the sta= te 650 megawatts an hour at off-peak usage times on March 20 for $345 a meg= awatt hour, more than $70 above the average price of $272.96.

State releases early spot market energy purchases        By = Jennifer Coleman ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 10, 2001  SACRAMENTO - On three day= s in May, California's daily power allowance topped $100 million, according= to a report released Monday by state power traders.  However, the source o= f those high prices was from not solely from Texas, home to many of the pow= er marketers and wholesalers Gov. Gray Davis has blamed for much of Califor= nia's power woes.  Public and private power companies such as Canada's B.C.= Hydro, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Sacramento's publ= ic utility also were high on the list.  The California Department of Water = Resources released the report, along with 1,770 pages of documents that als= o detailed the last-minute power purchases the state made on the spot marke= t in the first three months of the year.  Last-minute power buys on the spo= t market typically get the most expensive electricity available.  The repor= t details the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the sta= te took over electricity purchases for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Dieg= o Gas & Electric Co., and Southern California Edison.  The utilities had am= assed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase = power. Since then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights= on.  The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The secon= d-highest daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million. The = day before, the state spent $100 million.  But since May, spot market price= s have dropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower natural gas prices, = increased conservation which lowered demand and because of increased scruti= ny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price manipulation. Gov. Gr= ay Davis has said long-term contracts also drove the price down.  "It does = look like some of the spot market prices have gone down, but it looks like = it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis, spokesman for= Assembly Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot market prices "undersc= ores questions about the strategy of locking us into long-term contracts, i= f natural gas prices continue to drop," Fisfis said.  Most of the long-term= contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 years.  "It's unfortun= ate that it looks like we'll never get out from under these contracts," Fis= fis said.  Davis has already released details of the state's long-term powe= r contracts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and sev= eral news organizations, including The Associated Press, who said keeping t= he contracts veiled violated the state's open records law.  Davis released = copies of those contracts, but wanted to delay the release of the spot mark= et buys and short-term contracts. Releasing those details too soon after th= e purchases would reveal the state's buying strategy and could cause genera= tors to raise their already sky-high prices, Davis said.  The number of spo= t market buys will lessen, the Davis administration says, as more long-term= contracts are signed, reducing the state's exposure to the high-priced pur= chases.  The governor's office will release future short-term contracts and= spot market buys will be released on a quarterly basis, with a 90-day lag = time. Second quarter information will be released in October and third quar= ter documents will be available in January.  Davis maintains DWR needs the = delay to protect its ability to negotiate further spot-market power buys.  = According to the DWR, Canadian Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro, has = been paid $1.05 billion for spot market purchases as of May 31.  But Atlant= a-based Mirant Corp. topped that list, getting $1.24 billion as of the end = of May.  The newly released short-term contracts also show what the state h= ad to pay when it needed power the most.  On March 19 and 20, when rolling = blackouts hit California again, the state was forced into paying above-aver= age prices in its largest short-term contracts.  For example, Mirant sold t= he state 650 megawatts an hour at off-peak usage times on March 20 for $345= a megawatt hour, more than $70 above the average price of $272.96. The day= before, Mirant charged $343 a megawatt hour at off-peak in northern Califo= rnia when the average cost was $254.52.  Also on March 19, Mirant charged t= he state about $96 above the average price for power in Northern California= on a sale of 6,400 megawatt hours during off-peak times.

FERC Judge Says State Owed No More Than $1= Billion From Associated Press  July 9 2001  WASHINGTON -- California is ow= ed no more than "a billion dollars" from power wholesalers, a federal regul= atory judge said today at the end of 15 days of settlement talks in the sta= te's electricity crisis.  Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Comm= ission's chief administrative law judge, said that at the same time the pow= er suppliers probably are owed more than that.  The net effect of his preli= minary recommendation is that California probably will receive no refunds f= rom wholesalers.  Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in = refunds. The state has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said h= e will not recommend refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.  = It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary recommenda= tion would have on efforts to settle the dispute.  Both sides said before t= he judge's announcement that they expected a protracted legal battle in the= event the talks did not produce a settlement.  Michael Kahn, Gov. Gray Dav= is's representative in the talks, has said the state would seek more than t= wice the claimed overcharges if the dispute moved from mediated talks to a = courtroom.  The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are gr= ossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- Duke Energy, Dyne= gy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos.-- said in a statement that= they have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  John H. Stou= t, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company would agree= to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall settlement t= hat also would have to include protection from additional legal claims.  Bu= t Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains tha= t no refunds are justified."  FERC ordered the talks last month in an effor= t to resolve differences between producers and the state over the breakdown= of California's deregulated electricity market.  The state has accused the= producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices. The producer= s have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of n= atural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free mar= ket.  The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last= year from $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated that the state c= ould spend as much as $50 billion this year.  ----  On the Net:  Federal En= ergy Regulatory Commission: http://www.ferc.fed.us/   Copyright 2001, Los A= ngeles Times       Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppl= iers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show. RI= CH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ and DOUG SMITHS TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 = 2001  SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more divers= e group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davi= s, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records = show.  During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretch= es of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and privat= e entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid= to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by = the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.  Am= ong those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per meg= awatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & = Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe= r, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour = charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292= an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies s= ingled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., D= uke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid = for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe= r megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.  The figures co= ver the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state = during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month o= f razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies.  Davis spok= esman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at p= rivate out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the hi= ghest profits over the longest period.  "You have to look at the whole pict= ure," Maviglio said.  "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the= arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits= were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other enti= ties who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact t= hat we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or = Charlotte."  The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided t= o The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on = California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year= 's first quarter.  The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion= buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the comp= lexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high = prices are not limited to a few generators.  Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for= the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that price= s were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he= said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying pow= er in mid-January.  The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purch= ases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an ave= rage of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show.  In the first quarter of t= he year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest pri= vate companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's bigge= st power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta= -based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, c= harged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.  By contrast, a Calgary, Canad= a, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacrament= o Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.= A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification = of Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could no= t be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the = past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered= last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.  = A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, s= aid late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see= the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reac= hed Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of produc= ing the power needed by the state were extremely high.  More Power Bought T= han Projected  Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agen= cy's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falli= ng natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market.  Still, the s= tate had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more= than Davis' analysts had projected.  Hidlago said that was because of hot = weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will sho= w that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early Ju= ly.  The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in = June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to wel= l under $100 a megawatt-hour.

Copyright 2001, Los Angel= es Times       Duke Energy Asked to Allow Release of Data Power: Senator sa= ys the generator is refusing to make public some information crucial to the= price-gouging probe. Firm says it's complying. CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRI= TER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing= suspected price gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday= that Duke Energy is refusing to allow him to make public information key t= o his investigation.  Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the pr= ice bidding information from its Chula Vista plant available to committee m= embers and staffers. But under a federal confidentiality rule, the data can= not be made public without Duke's consent.  The documents concern the Chula= Vista plant, which former employees have alleged was ramped up and down to= drive up power prices during three days in January. However, state records= show that the agency overseeing the electricity grid ordered those gyratio= ns to keep the power flowing throughout the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal= thwarts the committee's investigation and efforts to enact possible remedi= al legislation because the confidential information cannot be shared with o= thers in the Legislature or the public.  Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the= Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that gives the company the authority = to decide which records it makes public and which stay secret.  "The only o= ne who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by what is provi= ded in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.  Former Employees T= ell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to ob= tain the information elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."  Th= ree former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last month = under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh= at seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergen= cy.  But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the= California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricit= y grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its exp= lanation.  Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to pro= vide a full picture of the plant's operation during the three days.  But Du= nn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging, said = Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed data, Du= ke was guilty of the same tactics.  "Duke is trying to draw the impression = that it has [provided] the full picture. But they are fully aware that we c= annot draw any final conclusions until all that data has been released. Tha= t hasn't occurred," Dunn said.  To make a determination whether the Chula V= ista power was withheld to drive up prices, Dunn said, the committee must p= ublicly examine "the bids Duke submitted from which the ISO issued orders t= o the plant." They include the expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, = he said.  Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several pla= nts in California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and = off-limits to legislators not on the committee.  Duke spokesman Tom William= s insisted that the generator is attempting to comply with the committee's = demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke would agree to make the bidd= ing documents public along with other records the committee plans to turn o= ver.  "We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that= we are leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I= don't know what we are ultimately going to do."  The committee had threate= ned to cite eight wholesale generators unless they provide pricing and bidd= ing documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, have said they would compl= y to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant, were cited.  Dunn sa= id the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are trying to= comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formally charge= d with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is the fina= l arbiter of such issues.  Although there is scant precedent for levying pe= nalties against those cited for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing seve= re fines. In 1929, the most recent case, a cement company executive was sen= t to jail.  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times        NEWS ANALYSIS Concern = Over Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows Embedded costs may yield more rat= e hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion total could complicate plans to r= escue Edison. DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 9 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Eve= n as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gray Davis prepares = for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch on a new power= plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly more daunting = task of balancing the books.  It's a task with potentially far more long-la= sting implications for state coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for = consumers' wallets.  In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by = the governor's office as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-= control electricity market are having the opposite effect politically. A gr= owing concern about the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicat= ing one of Davis' most ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial r= escue of Southern California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate = in the Legislature. Questions about the contracts come as California readie= s a complex $13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund f= or other power purchases.  Critics worry that costs embedded in the contrac= ts, on top of the billions needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead = to additional electricity rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer= advocates and business lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pact= s be renegotiated.  Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these= critics say the state should work to shorten the duration of the contracts= and lower some of the prices. They argue that the state entered into the d= eals under duress after California's utilities neared insolvency and the st= ate Department of Water Resources took over the purchasing of electricity f= or more than 25 million residents.  "They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Co= mmittee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state s= truck with independent power companies when prices were at record highs.  B= owen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing "the best deals the= y could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiati= ons took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50."  Contr= acts Open to Challenges  The contracts could be challenged in court or, mor= e immediately, before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washingto= n. There, an administrative law judge could direct that the pacts be rework= ed as part of a settlement of allegations by Davis that generators overchar= ged the state for electricity by $8.9 billion.  "We ought not to say, 'Fine= , the contracts were the best we could do,' " Bowen said.  For his part, Da= vis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.9 billion in the= form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He attributes th= e recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to conservation, the ad= ministration's effort to increase power supply and--a major factor--the lon= g-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance on the volatile daily,= or spot, market.  "You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . = . dramatically shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Califo= rnians," Davis said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30= % from May to June.  Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped nego= tiate the contracts, said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, gi= ven the recent decline in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for Califor= nia's electricity-generating plants.  Freeman also compared critics to some= one who calls the fire department to douse a blaze. "After the fire is out,= " he said, "you complain about the water damage."  The contracts have other= defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics professor Severin Borenstein, = who says the deals helped to tame the volatile spot market by reducing gene= rators' incentive to drive up prices, while reducing the state's exposure t= o wild swings in price.  "The point of signing long-term contracts is not t= o get a great price; it's to reduce risk," Borenstein said.  Still, experts= have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior Court judge in S= an Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit by news organiz= ations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Davis unseal the c= ontracts.  An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each rep= resenting Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consume= r group; and large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-bill= ion price tag announced by the administration may not account for all the c= osts. When other expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equip= ment upgrades to any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an = additional 10% to 20%.  "Once the contracts were made public," Senate Repub= lican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who ca= n read began calling for those contracts to be renegotiated."  As buyers' r= emorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly are seen as = a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront fast-approa= ching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis from morphing = into a broader financial crisis.  A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptc= y for the financially hobbled Southern California Edison must be approved b= y Aug. 15. The deadline could be tighter, because the Legislature is schedu= led to adjourn for a monthlong break July 20.  Davis' rescue plan, along wi= th legislative alternatives, languishes in the Legislature. The plan, which= has little apparent support, would require the state to buy Edison's syste= m of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and permit the utility to charge = ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3.5 billion.  Some lobbyists a= nd lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approved in March by th= e California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a kilowatt-hour the la= rgest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue generated under the = new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-term power contracts an= d repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would be the largest muni= cipal deal ever.  Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for t= he Edison rescue remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may n= eed to seek a separate rate hike to cover its costs.  As written, the contr= acts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk away from them if he= concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism persists and crosses = political lines.  Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers = Union, and Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Tech= nology Assn., rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in s= eparate interviews, they sounded similar themes.  "If there is a way to buy= our way out of these contracts, even if we have to pay damages, we'd be be= tter off in the long run," Snyder said.  Stewart, like other business leade= rs, does not advocate abrogating the contracts. But like many familiar with= the terms, he hopes that some deals can be renegotiated.  "They are proble= matic," he said.  In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricit= y prices for the next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC t= o agree within a month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by= the Department of Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.  State= Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the $13.= 4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Street i= nvestors can be assured that they will be repaid.  "The state will be out o= f cash by the end of the year without the bond sale," he said. "We will mov= e toward fiscal insolvency."  The so-called rate agreement, a draft of whic= h was obtained by The Times, would bind customers of the three big regulate= d utilities to pay more than just the principal and interest on the $13.4 b= illion in bonds. Consumers would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to p= ay taxes, fees and other as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by t= he Department of Water Resources.  Additionally, the PUC would be obligated= to approve payments for programs by which the state would pay large and sm= all customers to cut electricity use, although the Legislature has not appr= oved the programs and their details remain to be worked out. The Department= of Water Resources estimates the cost to be $800 million, spread over this= year and next.  "It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D= -San Francisco) said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would requir= e the commission to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water = Resources decides to do."  "That is giving a blank check to some bureaucrat= ic office," he said.  'Dictatorial Power' Warning  Stewart of the manufactu= rers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it would provide the water a= gency with "dictatorial power."  "As skeptical as we are of the PUC process= , at least there is a process," Stewart said, referring to the commission's= procedures to set electricity rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR jus= t tells the PUC, 'This is what we need,' and the PUC must approve it."  Oth= ers say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the extraordi= nary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the Department= of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so deeply in= to debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to consumers. = In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January create= d "the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency" beyond the jurisdict= ion of the PUC.  "There is no public power agency in California that is rev= iewed by the PUC," said Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department = of Water and Power.  *  Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angel= es contributed to this story.  Copyright 2001, Los Angeles Times        Sta= te's refund demand rejected  Judge ends rebate talks, rebukes $9 billion cl= aim  Zachary Coile, Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writers  Tuesday,= July 10, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   URL: http://www.sfgate.com/= cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=3D/c/a/2001/07/10/MN117914.DTL   Washington -- An adm= inistrative law judge, delivering a powerful message to Gov. Gray Davis and= California energy officials, cast aside the state's claim that it is owed = $8.9 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and called for furthe= r hearings to determine "hard numbers."  The judge, ending talks designed t= o settle the dispute between California and power sellers, said the state a= nd its cash-strapped utilities may owe more in unpaid electricity bills tha= n they are owed for overcharges by the generators.  The comments by Federal= Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law Judge Curtis L. Wagn= er, although a strong endorsement of the generators' position, seemed to in= dicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue before it reached the f= ive-member regulatory commission.  "There are refunds due (to California) t= hat total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wag= ner said yesterday.  "At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from = the California Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities= in the state of California that probably are higher than any overcharges t= hat (the state) may come up with."  Now, it will be up to the federal regul= ators to settle the case. But the recommendations by Wagner, who mediated t= he talks, carry significant weight with the commission and cast doubt on th= e state's chances of collecting the full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.= The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings t= o calculate what the state and the power sellers are each owed. The hearing= s would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60 = days, Wagner said.  CLOSING SESSION Wagner made his comments in the closing= session of the 15-day talks, which were ordered last month by the regulato= ry commission to try to defuse the dispute between power wholesalers and Ca= lifornia officials before it reached the courts.  The judge's message was a= sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by California leaders -- especially D= avis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime less than $8.9 billion for= California's consumers.  The governor issued a statement shortly after the= close of talks insisting that California had won its basic case that the s= tate is owed refunds.  "I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodo= logy for calculating refunds and rejected the generators' position that no = refunds are due," Davis said.  The governor's chief representative at the t= alks, Michael Kahn, called the judge's statement a "ringing endorsement" of= the state's call for refunds. Kahn said the judge's order would improve th= e state's legal position if it files suit against power sellers.  GENERATOR= S FAVORED But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.  Fo= r example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8. 9= billion for alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001 -- even though t= he regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 200= 0 could be considered.  The judge said yesterday that he would stick with t= he October date, meaning that more than a third of the state's claim -- at = least $3 billion -- would not be refunded by the commission.  Brent Bailey,= vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North America, said that= under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for $1 billion to $1.= 5 billion.  "Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California = has been saying, it's a victory," Bailey said of the judge's statement.  Bu= t Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with a = serious offer.  "Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayer= s out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good f= aith," Davis said.  $716 MILLION OFFER  Wagner disclosed yesterday that the= generators had made an offer to California: $716 million in refunds.  The = judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Big Fi= ve generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6 milli= on by a group of 15 electricity marketers, $16.5 million by six California = municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-state power sel= lers.  California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it in= cluded no cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of= the state's debt off the books.  Throughout the talks, generators complain= ed that the California team was trying to shield some California companies = and government power providers from having to pay any refunds, and trying t= o disproportionately extract sums from out-of-state power companies.  FAVOR= ITISM CHARGED According to documents and interviews, the state attempted to= remove Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison, San Diego= Gas & Electric., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and other g= overnment power suppliers from the group from which it was asking for refun= ds, even though they were paid the same high rates for power as everyone el= se.  Representatives for the power sellers said they believe that Davis mad= e a political decision to demagogue the companies while refusing to comprom= ise on the state's claims. They say the governor calculated that his reputa= tion would be enhanced by continuing to attack the generators.  "The Califo= rnia delegation did not come into these talks with any willingness to compr= omise," said Mark Stultz, vice president of the Electric Power Supply Assoc= iation, a Washington, D.C., trade group. "They went in with a dollar figure= and never budged on that figure. If you're looking for a settlement, you h= ave to be willing to compromise."  Up next 1.

Gray Davi= s celebrated the startup of a new power plant in Pittsburg yesterday -- the= latest in a string of openings Davis hopes will help California "build its= way" out of the energy crisis. The state rushed to throw as many megawatts= on line as it could when it looked like the summer would feature regular b= lackouts, and yesterday the governor said it was paying off.  "This is the = third plant I've helped open in the last 13 days," Davis said, pumping his = fist as the Calpine Corp. plant belched an impressive burst of steam. "In t= he past 13 days, we've put more power on the grid than California did throu= ghout the 1990s."  The 555-megawatt Los Medanos Energy Center and the Sutte= r Energy Center that Calpine opened in Yuba City last week bring a total of= 1,115 megawatts online. Last month, Davis threw the switch on a Bakersfiel= d plant that opened more than a month ahead of schedule.  Davis used yester= day's event to blast out-of-state generators that he maintains have gouged = the state for electricity. Yet he lauded San Jose-based Calpine as a sort o= f energy favorite son.  "They were the first to enter long-term contracts w= ith us," the governor said. Calpine is among the big energy firms being pre= ssed by the state to issue refunds for what the governor insists were overc= harges, but unlike the others, Davis said, Calpine is giving ground in nego= tiations.  "They likely will be the first to enter into settlements with us= ," he said.  Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of effic= ient new gas- fired plants that will be as much as 40 percent cheaper to ru= n than their forebears, the state will be paying well above current market = rates for the first three months of its contract with Calpine.  Calpine Pre= sident Peter Cartwright insisted, however, that the company is not making e= xcess profits off the deal. To ensure that Calpine could provide the electr= icity even if plant construction wasn't finished by its mid-July target dat= e, the company bought the needed power from other energy traders at $232 a = megawatt hour when market rates were higher, he said.  In addition to the 3= 00 megawatts it has pledged to the state, Calpine will supply electricity t= o the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other power agencies.  In t= he long term, Calpine will be selling power to California at $59 a megawatt= hour, Cartwright said.  A spokesman for the state Department of Water Reso= urces, which started buying power in January after state utilities buckled = under high prices, said Calpine's rate is well below the $70 a megawatt hou= r the state is aiming for as an average price for the long-term contracts. = Cartwright said that with its recently opened plants, along with an 875- m= egawatt facility it plans to open in Pittsburg next May, the company is doi= ng its share to ease the state's supply crunch.  "Ours are the lowest contr= acts in the state," he said. "If these plants weren't online, we'd be havin= g blackouts."  A spokeswoman from the state agency that manages the power g= rid said California is skating so close to blackouts that "every megawatt c= ounts."  "It's definitely making a difference and it will continue to do so= over the summer," said Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the Independent S= ystem Operator.

Hydro's power trading sub= sidiary to refund $125 million to settle the state's allegations that it wa= s overcharged by the Canadian power company.  The dispute will now be resol= ved by U.S. judicial and regulatory authorities.  The offer from Hydro's Po= werex subsidiary came during 15 days of settlement talks between power gene= rators and distributors, California and other western states.  The talks, i= nitiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates cross= -border power sales in the United States, concluded Monday evening without = resolution.  Hydro spokeswoman Elisha Odowichuk said that under the offer, = the Crown corporation would have been subtracted $125 million from the $290= million California still owes British Columbia for power sales.  The $125 = million was Powerex's first offer and it did not change through the negotia= tions, she said.

Odowichuk said Hydro had to = join the settlement talks to preserve its otherwise lucrative power trading= relationship with California.

Gray Davis for gouging California during the power cris= is, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of = the money went elsewhere.  Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered le= ss than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, wh= ile public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to Californi= a got the rest.  The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be= more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials= are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of= Texas.  Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not= acting against power firms in his home state. "What's going on here, pure = and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- = most of them, incidentally, located in Texas," he said in May.  Yesterday, = a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas= firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who hav= e also gouged California.  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably h= ave handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind," sai= d Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.  The latest financial information is co= ntained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7= .2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May.  About $= 5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made = a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used. = Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most = expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and = buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropp= ed as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of even= ts that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could re= cover from customers.  The numbers released yesterday show that Texas compa= nies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2= billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to tu= rn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its invest= igation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt procee= dings.  Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis.= Powerex,  a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC = Hydro, received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity.

"I think we have demonstrated very clearly = both to the FERC and to the judge that the state is owed $8.9 billion and w= ill settle for nothing less," said Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray= Davis.  With negotiations at an impasse, the administrative law judge for = the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said California is probably owed n= o more than $1 billion in refunds.  "The numbers were too far apart," said = Curtis Wagner, the FERC chief administrative law judge.  California, Wagner= said, may receive nothing at all, because generators may be owed more than= they have to return for any overcharges.  He placed the refunds owed the s= tate at between $716 million and $1 billion. Power providers had offered $7= 16 million as part of an overall settlement, while California state officia= ls sought $8.9 billion, Wagner said.  He said California officials had not = made the case for $8.9 billion in refunds.  Salazar, however, said the stat= e would go to court and may ask for $20 billion.  Separately, Wagner split = off claims of overcharges from the Pacific Northwest, saying he has not had= time to consider those allegations under the short timetable ordered by FE= RC last month.  Wagner served as a mediator during the 15 days of negotiati= ons and will recommend a settlement to FERC by next Monday. The commission = ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences between pr= oducers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated electr= icity market.  Consumer advocates assailed the judge's recommendation and u= rged the state to continue its attempt to get refunds from what they say ar= e profiteering power companies.  "It's like catching a bank robber, but ins= tead of making him give back all of it, you only make him give back 5 perce= nt of what he stole," said Douglas Heller, spokesman for the Santa Monica-b= ased Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.  Power generators, howeve= r, were generally pleased with Wagner's comments.  Brent Bailey, general co= unsel for Duke Energy, said even if the formula Wagner recommends produces = $1.5 billion in refunds, "that's a reasonable amount in the context of thes= e settlement talks."  California officials, negotiating on behalf of utilit= ies, the Public Utilities Commission and state power buyers, accused the pr= oducers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive up prices.  The producers = have acknowledged prices are high, but blame jumps in the price of natural = gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings of the free market.  T= he bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year f= rom $7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated the state could spend a= s much as $50 billion this year.  The producers reiterated Monday that Cali= fornia's numbers are grossly inflated. Attorneys for the five major generat= ors -- Duke Energy, Dynegy, Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos. --= said in a statement that they have made a "very substantial global settlem= ent offer."  Reliant would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds as = part of an overall settlement that also would have to include protection fr= om additional legal claims, said John H. Stout, a company senior vice presi= dent.  But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and re= mains that no refunds are justified."

The c= ounty Health Department report found that 52 industrial facilities have ade= quate backup power plans.  The report to be presented to the Board of Super= visors today was prompted by a freak traffic accident that knocked out powe= r at Richmond's General Chemical Corp. plant. When the plant powered back u= p, a cloud of sulfur trioxide and sulfur dioxide was released.  Contra Cost= a hazardous materials director Lew Pascalli said that there is always a pos= sibility that a plant's hydraulic or mechanical systems could fail but that= those chances are slight given the growing number of power plants coming o= nline and the state's successful conservation effort.  He also said industr= y has done a good job preparing for outages.  "The industry is doing a good= -faith effort in this particular instance to make sure that nothing happens= ," Pascalli said.  County officials relied on industry records in determini= ng the adequacy of the different plans, such as having multiple electrical = leads feeding a source regulating hazardous materials.  Denny Larson, spoke= sman for the group Communities for a Better Environment, said the report re= lied too heavily on industry self-reporting.  "Unfortunately, the conclusio= ns of the report can't be backed up by the facts," Larson said. "Oil and ch= emical plants in Contra Costa have repeatedly had toxic releases due to pow= er failures over the years."  The 52 facilities include chemical plants, oi= l refineries and small shops that produce limited amounts of hazardous mate= rials.  For many of these businesses, the loss of power would shut down the= ir operations and make it impossible for substances to be released.  Larger= facilities, like oil refineries, have either their own backup generators o= r contracts with cogeneration plants that could supply all or most of their= power independent of the electricity power grid, according to the report. = Plans are also in place to conduct partial shutdowns at plants running on = reserve power during a blackout.  General Chemical said all electrical feed= s to the chamber processing chemicals are automatically pulled in the event= of loss of power. A backup generator will automatically come online to kee= p operations stable.  Dow Chemical has a contract with a Calpine power plan= t to supply it with electricity.

The judge o= verseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put the re= funds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion dollars. His= estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power suppliers dur= ing negotiations. The offer was rejected by California officials.  But it w= as unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would prevail, and= California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed to court. At= stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimately have t= o pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system collap= sed.  Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will = recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating = back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor= s such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the e= nergy suppliers had advocated during the talks.  Michael Kahn, who headed t= he California negotiating team, said the state would contest some aspects o= f the formula. But even without changes, Kahn said he was confident the for= mula will result in more refunds than Wagner estimated.  ``We think the num= bers even using the judge's formula are going to be in the multiple billion= s,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System Operator, which ru= ns the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9 billion dollars. If= we don't get all of it from the commission . . . we'll still get the remai= nder of the money'' through the courts.  Amount in dispute  Power industry = representatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.  ``We haven't gone = and run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere near the $8.9 billion= ,''' said Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy = North America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky number that nob= ody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate number.''  Wagne= r acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula, saying = he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the suppliers= .  The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last mon= th when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity= prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that und= er pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the = power suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigat= ion.  But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal, par= ticipants said.  ``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on = one end and you saw $716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to= splitting the difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties ge= nuinely wanted to settle. Others didn't.''  Wagner now has until Monday to = make his recommendation to the five-member commission, which will make the = final ruling on refunds. To date, the commission has ordered $125 million i= n refunds for periods since last Oct. 2.  Wagner said Monday that he will a= sk that a special hearing be set up in the next 60 days to get the detailed= information from the state and power suppliers needed to determine a refun= d total using his formula.  The state may not end up with any cash, as any = refund total could be applied to the several billion dollars California and= its utilities still owe many of the power suppliers.  Reflecting the tone = of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Monday blamed power supp= liers for the failure of the talks and challenged the commission to resolve= the situation.  ``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepay= ers out of billions of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good= faith with our team in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past= the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have th= e opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California= has demonstrated it is owed.''  Davis may go to court  At the opening of a= new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis told reporters tha= t he's prepared to take the power generators to court if FERC doesn't order= the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of $8.9 billion doesn'= t represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates put the figure as = high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about how those figures = were calculated.  John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy W= holesale Group, said the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.= 9 billion figure.  California officials and several suppliers said they wou= ld continue to negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Ca= lpine said his company is close to a settlement with the state.  Power supp= liers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energy commissi= ons' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner said he w= ill do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed for it. W= agner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan that power s= uppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State officia= ls wanted it to cover up to May 2000.  $3 billion difference  The state's $= 8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001. Factoring refunds = beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion in overcharges the= state says occurred in the earlier period.  Among the changes to the commi= ssion's formula that Wagner made was to revise the way the prevailing elect= ricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants the price limit determined f= or each hour of each day. The commission's formula sets a price limit durin= g Stage One power emergencies that remains in effect until the next emergen= cy.  But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University ec= onomist Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge w= ill produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.  ``That's the methodology= the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the California ISO on market iss= ues. ``By using the marginal unit for each hour, you'll get refund numbers = on the order of what the state estimated.''

The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts a= nd other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy mar= kets, according to documents that the state agreed to release last week ami= d a legal dispute over public access to the data.  In roughly the first fiv= e months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2 billion to Atlanta-based M= irant, the most any company was paid for electricity, followed by $1 billio= n to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro in British Columbia. It also pa= id $331 million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  The docu= ments raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen= around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the stat= e's purchases have come from government-run power generators in California = and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are from the No= rthwest.  Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, ha= s put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies = based in President Bush's home state.  The figures are tucked inside 1,770 = of pages of invoices that Davis has resisted divulging, saying disclosure w= ould encourage suppliers to charge more. The state, which last month releas= ed information on its long-term electricity contracts worth $43 billion, ag= reed Thursday to release the first quarter details.  Short on explanation  = The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Wate= r Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major ut= ilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the pric= e of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for wha= t prompted the decrease.  In January, for instance, the average price for p= ower on the spot market was $321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $33= 2 and dropped to $271 in May.  One megawatt powers about 750 homes.  Davis = spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's assert= ions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the out-of= -state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant shift of= money out of California.''  But the documents fail to shed much light on w= hether, as the administration contends, the price drop was due to long-term= power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year. Critics contend= that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit t= he state to pay high prices for many years.  Used for support  Republican o= fficials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis,= a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power generators even as = the price of power on the spot market was coming down, partly because of th= e declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants.  ``It's more cle= ar than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,'' said Assemblyma= n Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt the ratepayers= for the next five or 10 years.''  The newly released bills highlight the v= olatility of California's energy market, where the price per megawatt hour = ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any given day, the records show, the prices f= rom seller to seller varied widely, with some of the highest prices being c= harged by public utilities and companies outside Texas.  On one day in Febr= uary, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was charging $165 per mega= watt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was charging nearly $500 and= Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was charging up to $575.  The state= 's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power, including = the spot market and contracted power.  The state began buying power in mid-= January on behalf of the state's major utilities, which were unable to borr= ow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity.  San J= ose-based Calpine Corp., which is building several new power plants around = California including one in South San Jose, did only $29 million worth of b= usiness with the state in the first five months of the year, according to t= he figures.  The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas &= Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. were on the ropes financia= lly. PG&E later went into bankruptcy.  On Monday, state lawmakers took anot= her shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing E= dison.  While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison = will not win the necessary support in the Legislature, lawmakers have creat= ed several working groups to come up with alternatives.  Compromise plan  O= n Monday, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, unveiled the latest compro= mise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses= from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the E= dison bailout.  The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, o= wed about $1 billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive= about $300 million in Edison debts. Edison would be asked to swallow $1.2 = billion -- about a third of its debt. And big users would be asked to pay o= ff the remaining $2 billion in debts, possibly by paying higher prices for = power.  In exchange, large companies would be given the opportunity to buy = power on the open market, a system that would allow many of them to sign ch= eap energy deals.  Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday a= fternoon, but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receiv= e in the Legislature.

July 10, 2001  By DENA BUNIS and JOHN HOWARD The Orange County Registe= r  WASHINGTON The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California i= s owed maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the= $8.9 billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis.  And even at that, said Judge Cu= rtis Wagner, the electricity sellers are owed so much more in unpaid power = bills that in the end California might not see one red cent.  Wagner announ= ced his recommendation to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after tw= o weeks of fruitless negotiations between all the parties to California's e= lectricity crisis. With no settlement, the matter is now in the commissione= rs' hands.  Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 mill= ion in refunds, an offer the state rejected. "I don't think it's 8.9 (billi= on dollars)," he said afterwards, "because I haven't been shown that it was= ."  For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds= is a dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased pow= er. And the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of wardi= ng off future rate increases.  "California will get its $8.9 billion," insi= sted Michael Kahn, head of the state's delegation and the California Indepe= ndent System Operator. Kahn brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory = in the judge's assertion that the state is owed some refunds, a concept the= generators have been unwilling to embrace up to now, he said.  Since the t= alks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week Duke Energ= y offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed their refun= d offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the company wer= e dropped.  But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that = California is no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price goug= ing by power companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks= began.  And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the= FERC. If unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for ye= ars.  "You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink," Wagner sai= d during an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommen= dation. He has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points du= ring the often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators= and tried to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unpreceden= ted Sunday session.  "The numbers were too far apart," Wagner said.  While = Kahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's commen= ts, state Sen. John Burton, D-Francisco, called them "barely better than a = jab in the eye with a sharp stick." Burton agreed with Kahn that the state = has to do all it can to get more than that.  And Davis backed up his team. = "Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there we= re overcharges made because the market was broken," Davis said. "Remarkably= , the energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibi= lity to the people of California and own up to their profiteering."  Power = generators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though John Stout,= vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's "fundamental position= has been and remains that no refunds are justified."  Brent Bailey, genera= l counsel for Duke Energy, called the judge's recommendation, "a fair one."= Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis' failed= energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced= themselves from the state's refund request.  "I don't believe there really= exists a true justification for that number," said Assemblyman John Campbe= ll, R-Irvine. "I've never considered that anything more than a wild number = to throw out there."  The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of = overcharges because they are using different assumptions about how to compu= te the complex pricing structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the ma= jority of the generators' methods.  To start with, the state is asking for = $8.9 billion, but about $3 billion of those alleged overcharges happened be= tween May and October 2000, a period FERC is not looking at. FERC issued tw= o refund orders in March, finding that power companies had $124 million in = overcharges during power alerts. But the state is challenging that finding,= saying there were overcharges beyond those limited times. And the state is= also asking FERC to reconsider allowing refunds for May to October 2000.  = How energy panel affects California  Six months ago, few people had heard o= f FERC. Now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency charged wi= th making sure that the nation's power markets are running smoothly and tha= t wholesale prices are "just and reasonable," rolls off the tongue.  The fi= ve commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their home = state's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks that co= ncluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's ele= ctricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term pow= er contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months. FER= C's chief judge, Curtis Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.  WHAT WAS A= T STAKE?  For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis said was the amo= unt power companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's findi= ng? There should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.  For the generators:= More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for unpaid power bills. W= agner's finding? Generators are owed more money than the refunds they owe C= alifornia. He did not specify by how much.  For California consumers: A sta= ble electricity market. Until the refund issue is settled and power prices = are stabilized long term, what the future holds for rate increase remains u= ncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement. Consumers still in limbo.  HOW D= ID WE GET HERE?  In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The = state began appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the = utilities were running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the el= ectricity they sold. Rolling blackouts began.  Starting in January, the sta= te began buying the power, replacing the near-bankrupt utilities. Politicia= ns from Sacramento to Washington increased the pressure on FERC to cap rate= s. More than $27 billion was spent to buy power for California last year, c= ompared with $7 billion the year before. The price tag could reach $50 bill= ion this year.  On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps expert= s say could moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but = the caps have caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some = power off the market.  WHAT'S NEXT?  The FERC commissioners will receive Wa= gner's report within a week. In it, he will suggest they hold a fast-track = formal hearing that would last no more than 60 days.  If they agree, after = that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and other California mark= et issues.  If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagr= ee, they can contest FERC's decision in court. Such legal proceedings could= last many years.                State reveals details of power purchases  = Report shows last-minute energy buys in first three months of 2001.  July 1= 0, 2001  By JENNIFER COLEMAN The Associated Press  SACRAMENTO On three days= in May, California's daily power allowance topped $100 million, according = to a report released by state power traders.  The California Department of = Water Resources released the report Monday, along with 1,770 pages of docum= ents that also detailed the last- minute power purchases the state made on = the spot market in the first three months of the year.  The report details = the department's electricity spending since Jan. 17, when the state took ov= er electricity purchases for Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Diego Gas & El= ectric Co., and Southern California Edison.  The utilities had amassed bill= ions in debts and were no longer creditworthy enough to purchase power. Sin= ce then, the state has spent nearly $8 billion to keep the lights on.  The = state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The second-highest = daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.  But since May= , spot-market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate weather, lower n= atural gas prices, increased conservation that lowered demand and because o= f increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into possible price man= ipulation. Gov. Gray Davis has said long-term contracts also drove the pric= e down.  "It does look like some of the spot-market prices have gone down, = but it looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fis= fis, spokesman for Assembly Republicans.  The slight reduction in spot-mark= et prices "underscores questions about the strategy of locking us into long= -term contracts, if natural gas prices continue to drop," Fisfis said.  Mos= t of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20 year= s.  Davis already has released details of the state's long-term power contr= acts after losing a court battle with Republican legislators and several ne= ws organizations.  But Davis wanted to delay the release of the spot-market= buys and short-term contracts until now to keep the state's buying strateg= y secret.According to the state, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. got $1.24 billi= on as of May 31 for spot-market purchases.  Canadian Powerex, the marketing= arm of BC Hydro, has been paid $1.05 billion.  The newly released short-te= rm contracts also show that on March 19-20, when the state had rolling blac= kouts, the state paid above-average prices in its largest short-term contra= cts.  For example, Mirant sold the state 650 megawatt-hours at off-peak usa= ge times on March 20 for $345 a megawatt-hour, more than $70 above the aver= age price of $272.96.                 Tuesday, July 10, 2001        Ghost o= f Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol  Gray Davis is following footsteps of= former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos     JOHN M.W. MOORLACH  Mr. Moorla= ch is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector.   A recent L.A. Times poll= found that Californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers fr= om a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's subsidizing of the actual cost= s for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that ever= ything is fine. It is not.  The state has been spending an average of $57 m= illion, a medium-sized city's annual budget, per day for electricity. Now C= alifornia is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed = on its shareholder-owned utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankr= uptcy and another on the precipice. At this pace, it will not be long befor= e the state will be staring a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face.  Tha= t's why I'm gnawed by this "d?j? vu" sensation. The similarities and parall= els between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are frightening. H= ere's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer Robert Citr= on, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. The "expe= rts" and the "politicos" were comfortable with the investment scheme.  No w= onder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieti= es. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was i= nvesting and what his "exit strategy" would be. Guess what? The unexpected = happened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of borrowing suddenl= y exceeded the revenues being generated.  It caused the investment pool to = implode and Orange County taxpayers realized a $1.64 billion loss. In spite= of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the county's leadership, he= ignored it. The rest is history. In a half-pregnant deregulation scheme, t= he state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge. It also eli= minated the availability to acquire electricity through the use of long-ter= m contracts.  Guess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for = electricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It d= epleted the available funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are = imploding. In spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray Davis t= o avoid or minimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also his= tory.  It gets worse. Davis doesn't allow for the immediate raising of reta= il rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess= what? The expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves!= Nearly $9 billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled!  And in = the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced and onl= y compound this financial nightmare. Gov. Davis has done what no Libertaria= n or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He has retu= rned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of California= by subsidizing their electricity bills.  Bravo! It may not be the most equ= itable way of refunding taxes, but has anyone ever thought up a more effici= ent method? But, that's not all. He wants it back! Davis now wants to borro= w some $13 billion to replace the spent reserves and purchase even more ele= ctricity at rates in excess of the retail prices! When does this train wrec= k in slow motion stop?  And how do we pay off these bonds? Davis did not wa= nt to raise rates last summer or this past winter. But now he will to pay o= ff this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant uti= lity rate increase. The ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davi= s is gone about his expensive brilliance. And this elected official wants t= o purchase the power grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say= "no."  If we don't show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond= buyers will also say "no," unless they receive an attractive interest rate= . Just ask Edison International about attractive interest rates. It just su= bscribed $800 million in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. Davis wa= lked into his position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangi= ble legacy to show for it. No reserves. No improved highways. No new school= s. No infrastructure improvements. Only interest payments.  Wasn't that Cit= ron's legacy? If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent, the citizens of Cali= fornia will pay an additional $4.4 billion in interest costs. Over 15 years= it's $6.7 billion. And therein lies the true legacy of Davis, squandering = the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting from his = indecisiveness and lack of leadership!  It is so tragic that the perpetrato= r of this colossal mess is still in denial and continues to play the "blame= game." Orange County played the "blame game," too. But it had obvious perp= etrators and succeeded in a court of law in securing a significant amount i= n retribution payments. I'm not so sure California will have a similar resu= lt.

The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving= the yearlong dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which= the mediator may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of ab= out $1 billion. California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it = would seek that much and more, through the courts if necessary.  Although e= lectricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the power crisis = that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikely to be= resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity should hav= e cost during the last 13 months.  The power market has been mired in an ac= counting gridlock. The state claims that generating companies began grossly= overcharging for electricity -- with prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 2= 0 over year-before levels -- beginning in late spring last year. Generators= say they are prepared to pay some refunds, but argue that California 's es= timates of overcharges are radically inflated.  The mediator in the settlem= ent talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an administrative law judge for the fed= eral agency, who said today that the negotiations had failed to reach the c= omprehensive voluntary settlement he had sought.  Mr. Wagner said he would = recommend to the agency's commissioners that they convene a 60-day evidenti= ary hearing that would impose an administrative solution. He also said he w= ould suggest a method for determining fair prices for electricity .  Under = federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''just and = reasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last year th= at California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently began= imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations o= f past overcharges systematically.  While the scope of any refunds remains = uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks appeared more favorable for generators than= for Western states, which have collectively pressed for as much as $15 bil= lion in refunds.  Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California sho= uld have paid for power since last September, when the commission began mon= itoring California energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroact= ively apply a price control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated t= hat he supported a way of calculating the costs of power generation that is= closer to the method favored by power companies than to the one put forwar= d by California officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recom= mending could require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''mayb= e a billion'' dollars.  California officials gave a positive cast to the ju= dge's statements, calling them a step forward because he formally acknowled= ged that companies would have to pay some refunds. They also noted that wha= tever the level of federally mandated refunds, they would have the option o= f seeking more in court.  ''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' s= aid Michael Kahn, who represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talk= s. ''If we don't get it all from the commission, we will get the remainder = in the courts.''  Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did = not provide refunds in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue= generators for $18 billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generato= rs, mostly out of state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said,= speaking at the ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California= .  Representatives of several generating companies said that during the se= ttlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500 m= illion. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge w= ould result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their = offer than to California 's demand.  Still, several executives said they no= w hoped to reach individual settlements with the state that would end the t= hreat of prolonged litigation and allow them to collect several billion dol= lars they say they are owed by the state and its leading, financially press= ed utilities, which ran up huge debts to suppliers in the last year.  ''We = remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state that = will put this problem behind us once and for all,'' said Brent Bailey, vice= president and general counsel of Duke Energy.       Financial  Energy Refu= nd Talks Fail In Calif.; Federal Agency's Judge To Propose Settlement Peter= Behr    07/10/2001  The Washington Post  FINAL  Page E01  Copyright 2001, = The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved  California consumers were over= charged by as much as $1 billion by electricity suppliers since October, a = federal administrative judge said yesterday after state officials and power= suppliers failed to reach an agreement on the disputed charges.  Gov. Gray= Davis (D) and California power officials wanted $8.9 billion in refunds da= ting back to May 2000, when the state's energy crisis began.  A group of ge= nerating companies headed by units of Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc= . and Williams Cos. offered refunds of $716.1 million in the past week, goi= ng back to October. The companies said refunds should be offset by the larg= er amounts they are owed for unpaid power deliveries to the state.  "The nu= mbers were too far apart," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal= Energy Regulatory Commission, told reporters after two weeks of closed neg= otiations ended yesterday. Wagner acknowledged that his refund number was i= mprecise and said further hearings before FERC are needed to pin down the f= igure.  Calpine Corp. of San Jose and possibly one other supplier are expec= ted to reach individual settlements with the state, the judge said.  "A lot= of the parties genuinely wanted to settle and others didn't," Wagner told = reporters. "There's an old southern saying," said the 72-year-old Tennessea= n. "You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."  He declin= ed to say which side balked, but previously he had blasted California offic= ials for not modifying their initial demands.  Wagner said he will send his= own refund formula to FERC's five commissioners within a week. His formula= essentially will reflect what he thinks reasonable electricity prices woul= d have been in the state at various times since October, considering fuel c= osts and other factors. Charges over those levels would be subject to refun= d, if FERC agrees.  The judge's recommendation is likely to carry considera= ble weight with FERC's commissioners, according to energy analysts. Earlier= this year, FERC tentatively ordered $125 million in refunds for the first = three months of this year, an amount that Davis called far too low.  Facing= increasing political pressure from Congress, FERC -- with two new members = appointed by President Bush -- has taken a harder line on California 's pow= er prices.

"We will have a viable claim in state court and other jurisdictions for = the remainder," Kahn said. " California will get its $8.9 billion."  But th= e state's own expert witness, economist Eric Hildebrandt, chief market moni= tor for the California grid, testified before Wagner that the out-of-state = generators and other nonpublic power suppliers would owe about $3.7 billion= using FERC's pricing formula of last month -- less than half the $8.9 bill= ion goal.

Sch= mitt    07/10/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  (Copyright (c) 2001, = Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  WASHINGTON -- State officials and power-company= executives failed to meet a federal deadline for settling $8.9 billion of = disputed California electricity charges, as a federal mediator overseeing t= he talks suggested the state's demand was excessive.  Cautioning that he ha= dn't done formal calculations, Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the chief administrati= ve law judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, put the level of = potential refunds at "hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe a billion doll= ars." He also said any sums due the state could well be offset by monies it= s insolvent utilities owe in unpaid power bills.  Mr. Wagner said he would = recommend to the commission that any refunds be calculated only from Octobe= r -- the state had been seeking rebates calculated from May 2000 -- in line= with an earlier FERC jurisdictional ruling. That decision alone would shav= e $3 billion from the $8.9 billion claim.  Mr. Wagner, who is expected to i= ssue formal findings in the next few days, said he would recommend that the= FERC hold an evidentiary hearing to assess the correct method for figuring= refunds.  The collapse of the talks doesn't preclude individual deals late= r between energy companies and the state, which has accused them of overcha= rging for power during the past two years. Yesterday, some industry lawyers= indicated a willingness to keep bargaining, and Mr. Wagner said two "parti= al" settlements were in the works.  Yet, absent any such solution, the over= charge issue -- a flash point in the California power crisis -- is apt to b= e resolved in protracted legal and regulatory proceedings, which could drag= on for months or even years.  The negotiations began June 25, with a deadl= ine set for midnight last night. But late yesterday, participants indicated= they were billions of dollars apart, with basic differences over everythin= g from the disputed charges to doubts about whether the FERC, which ordered= the talks, could enforce a deal because of the industry's questions about = the reach of the agency's authority.  "We haven't reached a settlement. We = really haven't come close," said John Stout a senior vice president of Reli= ant Energy Inc.'s wholesale-power group. Reliant had offered to pay Califor= nia about $50 million to extricate itself from the fight. That is more than= a third of the Houston company's operating profit during the relevant peri= od, he said, although far shy of the more than $375 million California soug= ht from Reliant.  Mr. Wagner said the industry offered a total of $716 mill= ion to settle the matter.  The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the = agency's authority and credibility. The FERC, a onetime regulatory backwate= r, has come under intense scrutiny of late for its largely hands-off monito= ring of deregulated California markets. The commission has ordered some com= panies to pay refunds, but they have been relatively small -- such as a $12= 4 million rebate covering wholesale electricity bills in California in Janu= ary and February.  California Gov. Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FER= C members will take a much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to = act quickly on the judge's call for a hearing and other findings.  Yesterda= y, Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov. Davis at the sett= lement, declared he was "gratified" by Mr. Wagner's findings, saying they v= alidated the state's claims to some refunds, a concept the industry had rej= ected at the talks' outset. "We've had a ringing endorsement of the idea of= refunds and we'll get back lots of money," he said, adding that what the s= tate doesn't recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court.  But power genera= tors, who derided the state's request for a huge refund as "ludicrous" and = "unsound," felt vindicated by yesterday's proceedings. "The state came away= with far less than its expectations," said Robert Loeffler, an attorney fo= r a unit of AES Corp. of Arlington, Va.

   Published Tuesday, July 10,  2001     State discloses spot power  buys  By Andrew  LaMar TIMES STAFF WRITER   SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power  sales of $922,000 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District to more than $1  billion of power sold by Atlanta-based Mirant power company.  All told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per  megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of  agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices.  In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.

 got your message.  talk to you at 5 pm your time.  best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Something's wacky with your server.  I got Rick's note, but ain't received your original.  And you are, indeed, awesome, MRS. Hunter.  Best, Jeff 
 Worse, there was no attachment in Rick's note.  Could you forward to me the final.  Thanks a gazillon.  Best, Jeff 
 You're fired. 
 FYI.  Please keep confidential until further notice.  Important to note that this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the specific language.  It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the Legislature as soon as possible.  In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed "rate agreement" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's "revenue requirement" next week.  I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.  It's going to get very interesting from here.  Best, Jeff 
 Great first cut.  Thanks very much.  Keep 'em coming.  Best, Jeff 
 Left him a message earlier.  Haven't heard back yet.  I'll call him again first thing in the AM.  He's probably busy getting his number changed.  Best, Jeff 
 Folks.  I'm working on it, but it's going to require quite a bit of work.  Please chk your emails later this evening for the next draft.  I'll page folks--those with pagers, that is--to notify when I've emailed it.  Scott, please inform Hedy and Bev.  Best, Jeff

  LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis  Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones   By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country, raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a megawatt-hour - about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances in which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's cash-strapped utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing the LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from Jan. 18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those charged by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized repeatedly as price gougers.  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that the LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became Davis' top energy adviser.  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's two largest utilities.  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators."  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return calls for comment.  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.  Power To Sell   According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling power to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed in throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but only needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as much as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators were charging.  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt and will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in an interview last year.  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid, the LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001 by as much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the utility.  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying the costs of producing electricity were extremely high.  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement talks between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous sums selling surplus power to California at the last minute.  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires  07-10-01  1557EDT  (AP-DJ)--07-10-01 1557EDT :TICKER: EIX PCG SRE :SUBJECT: EUTL CA COBO MU PETR Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones and Company, Inc.

 Business&Finance: ESB ownership of network is questioned - Competition Authority says separation of national grid from core company does not go far enough. Arthur Beesley reports  11/13/2000 Irish Times 18 Copyright (C) 2000 Irish Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)  The Competition Authority has questioned the ESB's ownership of the electricity network in the newly deregulated power market.  In a paper submitted to the Department of Public Enterprise, the body said the separation of the ESB's National Grid operation from the core company did not go far enough to ensure fair competition.  It said arguments in favour of the ESB retaining the transmission and distribution system ignored the 'overwhelming conclusion' that a generation company which owns such assets 'will naturally favour itself' at the expense of customers and reliability.  The paper has not been published yet. It is believed to state, however, that the ESB's retention of its 'non-competitive' transmission and distribution assets and its 'competitive' electricity generation business was unwise from a competition perspective.  The National Grid, which controls when individual power stations feed electricity into the network, was separated from the ESB when 27 per cent of the market was opened last February.  In theory, this meant the ESB could not favour its own generation stations over more efficient competitors when deciding which plant to switch on and off as demand for power fluctuates.  But the authority's response to the Statutory Instrument behind the separation - which renamed the National Grid as Eirgrid - said more should be done to ensure the market operates fairly.  The paper said: 'Some argue that as long as there is an independent operator of the underlying transmission system, ownership of the transmission system can remain in the hands of an upstream generation operator.  'In accordance with this line of argument, the shift of operational control of electricity transmission to Eirgrid would mean that discrimination in dispatch [of power] and other operations would not be possible. However, the Competition Authority considers that this argument ignores the overwhelming conclusion that the generation company that owns the transmission lines will naturally favour itself.'  The Statutory Instrument followed complex talks, which led to an agreement between the ESB, its trade unions and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Ms O'Rourke.  When Eirgrid was formed, the ESB retained ownership and responsibility to develop and maintain the high-voltage national transmission system and the low-voltage local distribution network.  The authority says these, too, should be separated from the ESB to ensure the competitive market functions fairly, according to a person familiar with its paper.  This would ensure equal access to the power network and an objective, transparent, non-discriminatory treatment of all electricity generators in the market, it said.  The paper argues the ESB has an incentive to allocate as many costs as possible to the operation of the transmission and distribution system.

 Greetings.  The reference is specific to statements that we made when FERC first issued it's proposed order on Nov. 1 regarding how to fix the mess in California.  We said (and FERC was a little cranky about this) that we were pulling 300 MWs of power plants that we'd planned to build in California on the basis of the price cap proposal included in FERC's proposed order.  It was in the press.  So it was narrowly confined to the power plant proposals. Calpine subsequently announced that it, too, would pull the peaking plants it had planned to developed.  I think that they announced the same amount would be pulled---300 MWs.  If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call.  Best, Jeff    Cynthia Sandherr 11/14/2000 05:40 PM

 Nov 16,2000  California Power Plants Get Jolt As Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut  By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity.  The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk.  That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S. burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than gas and generally has been costlier.  In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies last summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now, they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical problem and into a gas problem.  One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas and electricity affect each other. "We don't just need new generating plants and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too," said Terry Winter, chief executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies.  "You can't look at these things in isolation."  The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company, San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas, and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when  they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power plants here need to operate.  The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer.  What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and not big power plants.  The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, but especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal units to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8% from a year ago.  "Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation," said John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in the Northeast, based on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.  High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was $228 per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the price a year earlier. 
 Lisa:  Sorry, but Joseph's gone on vacation for the week.  I think that the size of the group is going to require that we do this offsite.  We use the "Park Hyatt" in San Francisco.  Could you check with Paul and let him know that I think that we need to go offsite, given the size of the crowd, and if he agrees, could you go ahead and check into getting a room at the Park Hyatt?  As always, I'm greatly indebted.  If there are any problems, or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to give me a call.  Best, Jeff    Lysa Akin@ECT 11/16/2000 10:37 AM

 Despite Its Depressed Stock, Commerce One Prepares for Blastoff By Joe Bousquin Staff Reporter 8/31/00 1:15 PM ET URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1062174.html  Poor Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq). Despite its best efforts, including Wednesday's 21% gain, it's still less than half the stock it used to be. Trading at about $63 a share, it's well off its split-adjusted high of $165.50, reached near the end of last year. Meanwhile, archrival Ariba (ARBA :Nasdaq), at about $150 a share, has steadily been marching back toward its all-time high of $183.31. It has jumped 47% since reporting its earnings on July 12. But as Wednesday's move may indicate, it may be Commerce One's turn. People are beginning to pay attention to the strength of its partnership with Germany's SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR). An exchange that Commerce One is helping build for the big automakers is about to crank up. And perhaps more importantly, some observers are beginning to see some value in Commerce One's focus on so-called direct B2B, which involves buying and selling major supplies like steel for cars instead of office supplies. Issues Aplenty Of course, there are still plenty of issues facing Commerce One, the same issues that have held its stock down. For instance, it carries the stigma of being a concept stock because no one knows whether those same big industry exchanges actually will work. Its sluggish stock also puts it at a disadvantage to chief competitor Ariba when it comes to making acquisitions to grow. But for now, there are signs that sentiment is shifting in Commerce One's favor. Gavin Mlinar, an analyst at Sands Brothers, sees three short-term positives for Commerce One. (He's the analyst who had the gall to downgrade Ariba on valuation concerns. His firm hasn't done underwriting for either company.) Mlinar says the word on Wall Street is that Commerce One, along with its new best friend SAP, will announce two new online exchanges in the coming weeks. (TSC's Adam Lashinsky recently wrote a column about the partnership between Commerce One and SAP.) While those sorts of announcements no longer guarantee a moon shot for a company's stock, they could show that the partnership is working. Two weeks ago, they announced new exchanges in the mining and energy industries. Commerce One declined to comment about the possible exchanges. Blastoff On top of that, Covisint, the mega-exchange that Commerce One is helping build for the auto industry, is slated to begin operations at the end of September, which could give the first indication of whether these exchanges actually work. Then there's the coming completion of Commerce One's acquisition of consulting firm AppNet (APNT:Nasdaq). Investors initially reacted negatively to that deal. But since then, it's become clear that there aren't enough consultants in B2B to go around, so the deal will give Commerce One its own army of geeks to plug in its software. "There's no doubt that investors are in a good position with" either Commerce One or Ariba, Mlinar says. "But it's a matter now of who has the near-term operational catalysts. I think there, it's Commerce One." Beyond those short-term catalysts, others say Commerce One has been positioning itself smartly for the long term, especially with its focus on the direct business. "We think the big play here is in direct," says John Biestman, director of investor relations for Commerce One. "While we will continue to service the indirect procurement side, we are hitting at the heart of where we think B2B will be, which is direct goods. We want to be the best-of-breed player there." Ariba has also made headway there, but its focus has primarily been on the indirect business, in part because it's easier to get companies to buy things like paper and pencils online than material that actually goes into the manufacturing process. But with companies becoming more comfortable about buying and selling online, they're now looking to the direct business as a way to save more money. With big customers like GM (GM:NYSE) and Boeing (BA :NYSE) and its partnership with SAP, Commerce One could be ready to exploit this growing comfort. Direct vs. Indirect "What's happening is the marketplace is beginning to understand the difference between direct and indirect," says Ben Smith, a consultant for A.T. Kearney. (His firm hasn't done consulting for Commerce One.) "Picking a [software] solution for one doesn't necessarily include the other." Smith points back to Commerce One's partnership with SAP. For years, the German software maker has been concentrating on the complex kind of software that helps businesses build things. If a firm can successfully plug that in to software designed to buy the building blocks -- like Commerce One's software -- it could have a winning combination. "The SAP partnership legitimizes Commerce One in the direct materials space," Smith says. "It gives them much more depth from the product standpoint than they can possibly build on their own." Of course, Ariba isn't letting this business just slide by. It's working with partners i2 Technologies (ITWO:Nasdaq) and IBM(IBM:Nasdaq). But this is Commerce One's focus. So if companies do begin to use direct B2B, Commerce One will be ready and waiting.

 Sure Sue has filled you in, but just to be certain, my understanding is that Dan Douglas, attorney for WPTF, is going to meet with the AG (not sure when) in an attempt to narrow the scope of the subpoena.  Dan also plans to begin drafting responses to the subpeona.  Since we are a member of WPTF and therefore presumably covered by the subpoena, seems important that our attorney's coordinate with Dan.  Sue, if I've mangled anything, let me know.  Best, Jeff

 Rob: Here's a quick and dirty list of some lessons from California that Alberta may not want to repeat.  Steve, let me know if I've missed any messages we're using to describe California's woes (or mangled any, for that matter.  If you have any questions, don't hestitate to get in touch.  Best, Jeff 
 Great presentation, but the message seems a little blurred. 
 OK.  It's done.  Got two places.  One sleeps 8 and is big and is where we can have the party.  The other sleeps 6 and is very close by.  Right on the beach, so surfing will be a must.  Who is on your list for invites so far? 
 Dave/Sandi:  FYI.  In Joseph's absence, his fill-in asked that I take a call yesterday from the Mayor's office.  They called to confirm the meeting set up for Dave, Mike Day and Bev Hanson on Nov. 29th at 4 PM to discuss the serious electricity shortage in SF.  Best, Jeff 
 Chuckles is a must invite.    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 11/17/2000 05:49 PM 
 Counting on Paul.    Susan J Mara 11/17/2000 06:25 PM 
 I'm adding my two cents.  Here's 3, but not 4.  Few things.  1) I considered that everything was "material."  That reasonable?  2) Dylan, I struggled with the ban on preservatives, but ultimately decided it was unusual, not extraordinary, since the book sez that any write down of inventory is unusual, as opposed to extra.  But a case for extra can still, be made I think.  3) I did not include the 1994 litigation expense associated with the ban, since it seems to me that it's merely an expense that they would have taken in 1994, as opposed to a "potential litigation outcome" that they'd make an allowance for---I could be wrong, though.  4) Finally, I assumed that the depreciation-related gain was already included in the 1995 "income from continuing operations" number, and consequently included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet, rather than make it an explicit line item in the income statement.  I'll look at Kim's #4 and if I have any comments, I'll add them to hers and circulate.  Best, Jeff      Kimberly Kupiecki <kkupiecki@arpartners.com> 11/18/2000 06:54 PM 
 OK.  Having taken a second look at the spreadsheet I sent yesterday, here's a revised sheet (there was a math error in the original), and my adds to Kim's #4.  Most significant issue:  the discrepancy between Kim's and mine is that Kim's assumes that the $9,5 million includes pluses from things like dep/gain on sale, while mine assumes that it doesn't (i.e., Kim subtracts them, I add them).  No big deal, we just need to make an assumption and go with it. There's a couple of other differences that are identified in the answer to #4--again, just need to make the call either way.  Best, Jeff 
 Rumor on the street that the legislature may make a last minute play to change the make-up of the governing boards (at least for the ISO) from the current stakeholder make-up to one made up of appointees of the governor. 
 My understanding is the same.  Content looks good.  Message points been developed in the event they're needed?  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 11/20/2000 08:07 AM 
 Will have any comments to you pronto. 
 See attached.  Just a couple of typos corrected in strike-out-underline. Question:  Thought I'd included the gain on sale as "unusual" as opposed to "extraordinary."  If we leave it out, are we assuming it's already included in the $9.5MM?  If so, we might want to include a note at the bottom of the spreadsheet like, $9.5 MM figure includes $750,000 gain on sale of certain assets completed in 1995."  Or am I just totally out lunch on this one.  Thanks.  This one was a little messy.  You did a great job of pulling it together.  Best, Jeff 
 My suggested edits are in CAPS. 
 FYI. 
 I like it.  Give it one final read through for final refinements.  Then send to bay guardian, sf weekly, pacific sun (marin), (and the east bay has a weekly mag, too, the name of which escapes me--might be out of berkeley). Any of these would give good exposure, and likelihood of someone of your caliber getting in is pretty high. 
 get better. 
 No problem.    Kimberly Kupiecki <kkupiecki@arpartners.com> 11/20/2000 01:02 PM 
 Hi, Marcie.  I've added two things to the end of the update:  PG&E/Edison sue the PUC in federal court to recover procurement costs. Edison files proposal with PUC to declare rate freeze is over and establish a new rate freeze at 110% of old rate freeze that would last for 5 years.  I don't have all the details to fill in, though some of the details might be available from the PG&E/Edison websites, and Sue and Mona might have additional info.  Hope this helps.  Best, Jeff 
 will do. 
 Might be useful to observe how others react prior to responding.  The good senator may have to fight over the surplus with a lot of teachers looking to spend the $$s on school books.  That fight could get interesting if the backdrop for the debate is a CEC report that sez "no problem, we're in charge."  I'm sure we'd be willing to build a few plants for $2 billion...    Susan J Mara 11/20/2000 02:10 PM 
 my pleasure. 
 No, you're correct.  In the spreadsheet, there were three sorts of "items": discontinued ops, unusual items, extraordinary items, and accounting changes.  The sale of the assets came about in the attempt to "trim the fat" (or manage earnings, you make the call).  Here's the line item from my spreadsheet:    It came right after the entries for the "unusual loss from the government ban."  I included it with the "unusual" items (right after discontinued ops and right before extraordinary items.  Big question is, is it included already.  I assumed not, since (though it's confusing), the problem makes is sound like none of the additional "agenda items" were accounted for.  I don't think it's a huge deal, though.  The questions left a lot of room for ambiguity.  Best, Jeff    Dylan Windham <dwindham@uclink4.berkeley.edu> 11/20/2000 02:16 PM 
 I agree completely, which is why I think the *$(*#-ed case is confusing.  Let it go.  Leave as is.  Think about it no more.  See you tonite.  Jeff 
 great time.  thanks a million.  sorry i had to do homework for some of it. what would you like me to cook/bring for friday?  i make a mean oyster stuffing.  and my homemade cranberry sauce is ok, too.  just let me know.    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/20/2000 11:57 AM

 These performance reviews may push me right over the edge.  Good talking to you earlier.  Sounded like the Paul I know and admire.  You sounded energized.  Looking forward to having you around more.  One thing.  Please don't count December out as a possible start time for the special session.  Anything can happen.  Book your hotel room early.  Best, Jeff 
 the damned book costs $100!  i've borrowed yours.  you know where to find it. 
 There's a place for working and re-working.  There's also a a very important place in art--writing in particular--for spontaneity and whim.  I'd do a tweak here and a snip there, but quickly and only around the edges, and submit it as a film review.  It's novel, it's fun, and exposure'd a good thing.  Things are good.  Going to be weary for the next 3-4 weeks until schools out, though.  Best, Jeff    "Scott Laughlin" <scottwl@hotmail.com> 11/20/2000 04:15 PM 
 Rick:  Just want to let you know that I missed the boat a bit in coordinating my reviewers with Paul.  In my first attempt to input them in the system, I hesitated including you for the simple reason that I'm certain you have countless other reviews to do already, and, frankly, I feel that you're an integral part of my review whether you're formally on the list or not.  When I went back to make my final additions to the list, the systerm was already closed--Paul had approved the first round, which I guess shuts it down.  It's likely not appropriate for reviews to happen outside the system, but I wanted to let you know that, from my perspective, it would be great to receive from you.  I'd value it a lot.  And I think we've worked closely enough together over the last year for you to have a basis for reviewing me. But again, I'm of the view that irrespective of the list, you partake in my review of necessity, and I don't want to add any additional burdens to an already loaded schedule.  No big deal, just wanted to let you know.  And I'm having a field day filling out your review. ("Rick discriminates unfairly against neon-colored shirts.")   Seriously, I was quite pleasantly surprised to have ended up as one of your reviewers.  Best, Jeff 
 I threw out the green shirt.  Swear to god.    Richard Shapiro 11/20/2000 05:18 PM

 Forgive the tardiness.  As soon as I come up from air from completing a tidal wave of performance reviews, I'll give a full report.  Bottom line:  His message is a very good one.

 Doesn't strictly qualify as an origination opportunity, but through a contact, I've met with some folks who have some pretty nifty network hardware/software that offers some interesting possibilities w/respect to network performance (optical routing technology).

 Internet B2Bs Rose Hard and Fell Hard Once Before. Time for Act Two? By Joe Bousquin Staff Reporter 8/30/00 9:22 PM ET URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1060952.html  Beware the booming B2Bs. Several business-to-business stocks rocketed upward Wednesday on little news as the Nasdaq waffled for most of the day. While some market watchers said investors were betting on a strong quarter, many analysts couldn't explain increases of 15% or more in stocks like Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq), Ventro (VNTR:Nasdaq), PurchasePro.com (PPRO:Nasdaq) and Clarus (CLRS:Nasdaq).  Big Day for B2B Several of the stocks rallied Wednesday on little news.   "You've got me," says Bill Epifanio, B2B analyst at J.P. Morgan. "They're all going nuts on nothing." Since earnings season ended, sentiment about B2B stocks has shifted back to the rose-colored variety in this sector. While this change is based on the concrete results that companies like Ariba (ARBA:Nasdaq), i2 Technologies (ITWO:Nasdaq) and FreeMarkets (FMKT:Nasdaq) delivered, investors also may want to pause and reflect. After all, it was only this past spring that investors grabbed any B2B stock within reach on hopes of unlimited growth, only to have them come crashing back down. Focus "Before, we were buying stocks on promises of what they could be, and that's when it got out of hand," says Eric Upin, B2B analyst at Robertson Stephens. "Now, you've got to focus on which stocks are delivering lots of growth and revenue." Upin looks to Ariba and i2 Technologies as examples of companies that are actually delivering. (He rates both a buy, and his firm hasn't done underwriting for either.) Ariba recorded $153 million in deferred revenue in the most recent quarter. Deferred revenue is money that a company collects before it actually delivers a product or does its job. It's a good signal, because if people are willing to pay before a company gives them something in return, it means there's strong demand. Ariba was up $8, or 6%, to $152.50. i2 is considered a strong player in supply-chain management software, and it has a partnership with Ariba and IBM (IBM:NYSE). It climbed $11.13, or 7%, to $168.75. Reaching? But in a possible indication that investors may have just been reaching for any B2B stock, Ventro finished up $2.69, or 21%, at $15.50 on no news. This is the same company that upset analysts and investors with a poor second-quarter performance, with just $1.8 million in net revenue. "Investors need to be more careful regarding which of the B2Bs they select," adds David Hilal, a B2B analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey. "When B2B was at its highest, any company that used that acronym seemed to perform well. Now, you have to dig deeper and figure out which ones are the real players in this new economy." Meanwhile, one of the most interesting subplots Wednesday involved Commerce One. On no real news -- there was talk about an already announced deal -- Commerce One shot up $10.88, or 21%, to $63.25. There's been a lot of chatter about the company lately. Gossips love to talk about how its partnership with German software maker SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR) might lead to a merger. Then there's the persistent rumor that the two companies will soon announce two more Internet exchanges for major industry groups. On top of that, Covisint, the big auto exchange that Commerce One is helping build, is setting up to launch near the end of September. Lump that in with the fact that Commerce One's stock has slouched in Ariba's shadow lately, add a dash of Wednesday's positive sector sentiment, and you've got the most active stock on the Nasdaq Wednesday. It traded more than 27 million shares, whereas it usually trades 6.6 million. Ready to Bolt Gavin Mlinar, an analyst at Sands Brothers, says the stock has been setting up for a move for a while. "September is a big month for them; they have so much on the table for a potential lift," Mlinar says. He's been crowing about Commerce One since mid-August, when he said the company was starting to look more attractive than Ariba on a valuation basis. And overall, Mlinar contends that conditions were right for a B2B run. "The emphasis and momentum has clearly been building lately," he says. "There wasn't much, on a broad basis, since April, and now we're seeing a total rotation into these names." Which is just what some observers are cautioning against. 
 thanks.  would it be a violation of interstate commerce to keep press from alberta from crossing the border into the states? 
 ok.  i'm on for stuffing and cranberry sauce. 
 Sure this is just what you needed.  Best of luck.  Best, Jeff 
 neat!  don't worry, i'm excited to cook!!!!  i'll try to do it in advance!!!!  but if i can't, i'll need to cook at your place!!!!  that ok?!?!?!!!!!!  see you soon!!!!!  Best! Jeff!   P.S.  it's 3:14 PM!!!!!!    Nancy Sellers <Nancy.Sellers@RobertMondavi.com> 11/21/2000 05:09 PM 
 I'd leave a voicemail with Sandi (she's taking voicemail on her trip) and ask her if she'd like for you to contact them. 
 got your message.  a hearty congratulations on the portland general approval from ferc.  i'm chained to my desk doing reviews.  best, Jeff 
 Hey buddie: Give me a call tomorrow.  Want to catch up on a few things.  Thanks a bunch. Best, Jeff 
 Alberta? 
 I'm not sure which is worse, the story, or the timing.  You psyched about the FERC approval?  And is there a story behind the sale of Sierra's power plants? 
 Now wait one darn minute, lil' lady (do you hear John Wayne's voice?).  The price cap in California remains--that's right, remains--at a lofty $250/Mwh. Thank you, Government Affairs.  Seriously, seems reportable, given that at one point it had moved to a time-differentiated cap.    Susan J Mara 11/21/2000 05:47 PM 
 pls call at 415.782.7822.  thx, jeff

 Agree that we should decline to participate.  I also got a call from IEP regarding the press conference and strongly encouraged them to signicantly diversify the group to include customers, consumer groups, and the like.  Haven't heard about the meeting on the first with the governor's staff. Interesting that the administration is choosing to meet with folks on the day that the report is released.  For the same reasons that we wouldn't want to be grouped with generators at a press conference, we may not want to be grouped with generators when the staff disseminates the report's words of wisdom.     David Parquet@ECT 11/21/2000 06:50 PM 
 If there is a deal shaping up, it's happening by and large through the auspices of IEP.  We've thus far decided to maintain an arm's length relationship with IEP, choosing not to get too close to the generators.  If we want to influence any deal they cut, we'll need to assess how closely aligned/associated with them we want to be.  Further we distance ourselves, less likely we'll be cut in.  That said, Sue and I have been participating in IEP's (interminable) conference calls and actively weighing in to influence what they do.  There was considerable discussion on the last call about developing some sort of "price cap" proposal that could form the basis of a deal, but no discussion whatsoever regarding refunds of any kind.  There were differences of opinion about the benefits of doing a deal on a cap----Williams is dead set against it, Dynegy & Reliant seemed considerably more pliable.  We reminded folks that there are many other things apart from caps that California could do to "fix" the problem (e.g., site plants, forward contracts, retail market, core/noncore split, etc.), which might obviate the need for caps altogether.  We also recognized the political nature of the situation and expressed a willingness to discuss a cap that might be acceptable, but pointed out our general concerns with caps.  That last meeting provided the impetus for the 28th press conference, at which (hopefully) a large number of stakeholders with urge the Governor and the PUC to get off the dime and do something concrete that can help---develop a rational policy for forward contracting by the IOUs and abandon the "PUC as counterparty" policy that currently exists.  Again, haven't heard a peep about any deal on refunds.  Will check around, though.  Best, Jeff      Richard Shapiro 11/22/2000 07:46 AM 
 I'll check with Smutney.  Can you two check with your Dynegy and Reliant contacts in Houston?    Richard Shapiro 11/22/2000 07:46 AM 
 I'm available.    Richard Shapiro 11/22/2000 06:18 AM

 I'd prefer to wait on the call.  I'll be distributing my suggested refinements to and speakers for Rob's "Option 3" by COB today. 
 What's the latest tally in Florida?  It gets increasingly important every time Richardson opens his gawd-fersaken mouth.

 Here are IEP's comments on caps.  It's from a draft circulated last Friday,= =20 but just spoke with Smutney, and he said that the comments did not change= =20 substantively .  Very briefly, "IEP is generally opposed to caps, but if=20 FERC's going to go with a soft cap, 1) there's a lot of clarification neede= d,=20 2) it needs to include "upward ratchet," a la Heber and 3) it must be linke= d=20 with other reforms (i.e., forward contracting, siting, retail markets,=20 etc.)."  The comments do not explicitly address the level of the cap.  They= =20 also call for a technical conference.  Anything to add, Sue? ***************************************************************************= *** *************************************** B. Issues Concerning Implementation of the =01&Soft Cap.=018 =20  IEP has concerns about the implementation of the =01&soft cap=018 proposal.= IEP=20 has not and does not support price caps because it impedes the operation of= =20 the market and distorts price signals.  Such mechanisms should have no plac= e=20 in competitive markets in the long-run.  The Staff Report notes that caps d= o=20 not work. Citation; Also MSC,   IEP is concerned, as are others, that the= =20 soft cap proposal will fail to attract new investments in supply or foster= =20 meaningful demand response.   It is particularly problematic in terms of=20 attracting new capacity that will operate as peaker units for a limited=20 number of hours when weather-induced demand cannot be met from less expensi= ve=20 units or imports. Notwithstanding the apparent opinion of SMUD otherwise,= =20 there are demands which materialize only for a fraction of a percentage of= =20 the total hours of a year, and therefore some resources will only be=20 dispatched a short number of hours to meet that need.  These resources tend= =20 to be fast ramping, less efficient units that are not designed or intended = to=20 operate as =01&baseload=018 facilities.  Hence the suggestion that they =01= &just=20 operate more=018 to recover their costs is misplaced. =20 The soft cap also appears to be especially problematic to power marketers w= ho=20 make wholesale purchases for subsequent resale but who may not own the=20 underlying physical generation assets.  These entities have a major role in= =20 the marketplace in terms of bringing demand and supply together and they se= ek=20 return on the risks they undertake.

This=20 unintended consequence must be avoided or the markets will be hobbled. =20 IEP echoes the concern articulated by the CAISO that the soft cap proposal= =20 may divert or require additional ISO resources.    It will clearly compound= =20 the settlement processes at the CAISO as transactions above the soft cap wi= ll=20 require additional tracking and segregation to allow for potential=20 =01&unwinding=018 should the bids be disallowed.  It will also require some= form of=20 new software to provide for potential calculation of the weighted averaged= =20 prices suggested in the November Order, presumably in 10-minute increments,= =20 to blend with the market clearing prices established in the various markets= . =20 Moreover, if that averaged price associated with bids above the cap is=20 modified often, then CAISO will be required to =01&re-run=018 settlements o= r=20 undertake subsequent settlement adjustments.  It is possible that these=20 efforts=01*which are suggested as temporary measures in the November Order= =01*would=20 take away from CAISO=01,s efforts at developing solutions to longer-run pro= blems=20 in terms of software modifications/development.  At first blush the details= =20 regarding implementation of the soft cap proposal are not straightforward a= s=20 currently described, and any further exploration this approach will at leas= t=20 require a =01&technical conference=018 to clarify the mechanics and to ensu= re that=20 it can be done in a reasonable manner. =20 IEP could only support the soft cap proposal if it is part of a negotiated= =20 package of inter-jurisdictional programs, and provided that it is subject t= o=20 an pre-established unidirectional escalation mechanism, or a similar one-wa= y=20 mechanism that is tied to the development of new capacity within the WSCC. = =20 The inter-jurisdictional elements must include: ? establishment of standards applicable to potential refunds based on=20 allegations of market power abuse in FERC jurisdictional markets;=20 ? definition of durable reasonableness review standards applicable to=20 wholesale purchases by the load serving utilities such that they will no=20 longer be discouraged from entering bilateral arrangements on a forward bas= is; ? establishment of a =01&road map=018 by the California Commission that del= ineates=20 a firm timeline=01*with milestones=01*for the review and resolution of reta= il=20 market issues including market-based demand responsiveness; ? establishment of a =01&road map=018 by this Commission, in consultation w= ith the=20 CAISO, that delineates a firm timeline=01*with milestones=01*for the review= and=20 resolution of implementation issues associated with the Commission=01,s=20 subsequent order in this docket as well as other outstanding proposals such= =20 as generation interconnection rules and congestion management; ? establishment of firm sunset date, not to exceed 2003, to bound the=20 duration of soft cap, and implement a unidirectional escalation mechanism,= =20 not subject to subsequent lowering, which is based either on a=20 pre-established schedule or tied to increases in installed capacity within= =20 the WSCC.

 Hey: Just wanted to let you know that I've received all the SDG&E stuff and that you can count on me to completely drop the ball.  Kidding!  I'll take care of it.  I'm still awash in reviews and may not ever leave the building, which is why I'm not responding as promptly as I should.  Best, Jeff 
 Jim:  Have a great Thanksgiving with your family.  It's a great pleasure doing business with you.  Best, Jeff 
 Well, this shows the direction in which the "new" Commission is heading.  The very good news, though, is that  TW's proposal was included in both settlements (now that's hedging!).  Thus,  the benefits to TW were preserved under both proposals.  Congratulations.  That's fantastic--hard work that paid off.  We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.  We should discuss.  Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.  Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.   But we have a knack of making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here, whatever turns up at the end.  Best, Jeff 
 I'll be in D.C. Can't wait to see you.  Best, Jeff

 are you offering a finder's fee?  i'm cheap.    Jacqueline Kelly <JKelly@FairIsaac.com> 11/22/2000 03:00 PM 
 Thanks, all.  I'll get a compiled answer out later today. 
 Aleck:  I'll take a look at it.  If I have any comments, I'll forward them along. Also, I may forward along some very slight changes to the numbers on the ISO's RFP "experience," should you decide you want to incorporate those "lessons" into your presentation. I'll provide any amendments to those numbers by tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 OK folks, here it is.  Sorry for the delay, but those pesky questions ended up being more detailed than I anticipated.  Please take a quick look and let me know if there are any comments---more ambiguities than usual in this one. I'll await comments and finalize this evening.  Jimmie/Dylan--my apologies, but last Wednesday evening, I found out that I have to be in LA for a meeting tomorrow.  If I make it to class at all tomorrow, I won't get there until after the break.  Could one of you print out the case and bring it to class?  If not, don' t sweat it, I'll email him an electronic and turn in a hard copy to him on Tuesday. Sorry for any hassle.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks.  I'll soften the expropriation language.  I don't think they can disclose the $1 million on the product liability case, since the entire package appears to be one  negotation, all the pieces of which likely have to be agreed to, or no settlement.  But you're point's well taken and I'll try to acount for it in the answer.  Finally, I can't see disclosing the fact that I'm infringing on someone's patent in my annual report.  Seems like I'd have a hard time defending myself in court if they sued me, if I'd admitted it to it in my annual report.  If I don't see you tomorrow, have a good week.    Christine Piesco <christine.piesco@oracle.com> 11/26/2000 05:10 PM 
 see you at the freight.  best, jeff 
 Greetings Professor:  I'm in charge of managing our collective responses to this week's case and have been called out of town on business at the last minute.   As a result, if I make it to class at all tomorrow, I unfortunately won't make it until after the break.  While I think one of my teammates will bring a hard copy to class tomorrow, I wanted to plan for any mix-ups (contingencies?) by emailing a copy as well.  Best, Jeff 
 Folks:  Here's the final.   I incorporated some comments from Christine and emailed a copy to Aceves.  Jimmie/Dylan let me know if one of you can bring a hard copy to class tomorrow.  If not, he's now got an electronic copy, and I'll drop off a hard copy on Tuesday.  Hope to see you (for at least half the class) tomorrow.  Best, Jeff 
 You're the man.  I got some comments from Christine (sort of).  See most recent email.  I emailed it to Aceves, but if more changes come in, I don't see any problem telling him to disregard the email and use the hard copy you turn in tomorrow.  Thanks a million.  Greatly appreciated.  I owe you one. This one was really a hot potato.  First Kim, then me, now you.  Best, Jeff 
 Can get that number.  You want it pre "Blue Book" or pre AB 1890, or both. 
 $1 million.  p.s. the plant i was talking about is:  "hairy vetch"  or "purple vetch." i'll look for some.  you should, too.  if you find any, make sure it's "organic" and hasn't had any chemicals added to the seeds.  thanks again for a fantastic time over Thanksgiving.  I had a lot of fun. 
 Ferget it.    Cameron Sellers <cameron@perfect.com> 11/27/2000 04:20 PM 
 Folks.  Let me throw out a proposal.  I believe that we should immediately draft a very brief letter or press release that explains why the PD is misguided and will lead to very bad energy policy for the state, and why our settlement is the right one and why it's good energy policy for the state. The letter should be signed by everyone who signed the settlement.  It needs to be released by the end of this week.  Absent this kind of action, nothing's going to turn this thing around.  Spending time and money writing "comments" will be a waste of time and money.  We'll need to do a lot more, but I think we have to start this way or fold up our tents now.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff    Colin.Cushnie@sce.com 11/27/2000 08:54 PM 
 Greetings Linda:  Let me open by saying welcome, and by apologizing for the fact that California has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy.  Just wanted to pass along some info.  I'm sure you've seen Senator Feinstein's comments to FERC.  And I think you're aware that she held a meeting in California with a group of stakeholders (including Davis staff) on the day before FERC's recent workshop at which Steve testified.  She stated at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to place a price cap on the entire WSCC market.  Economists in the room expressed their strong misgivings about caps, but Feinstein seemed fairly focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation.  Not sure where it will go, but wanted to pass it along.  Best, Jeff 
 I'm not buying and goddam banjo.  I can't stand the noise those freakin' things make.  ferget it.   we kid!  I think that's it's a swell idea.  you can totally count me in on pitching in.

 FYI. 
 If there is going to be a play come the first of the year to meld California's PX and ISO, Skilling may want to consider pre-empting that agenda (and most of this is not new; already included in previous messaging points we've developed internally):  It's the gas industry, stupid---for profit transcos is the answer. California's big mistake was replacing one monopoly--the utility---with another--the PX.  PX's are not necessarily bad things.  But PXs with a monopoly is a very bad thing. Forcing the IOUS to buy everything from the PX was irresponsible. "Put everyone on a variable rate mortgage" story. Decision makers openly admitted that they put in place a strucuture designed NOT to encourage retail choice and competition. Decision makers actively urged families and businesses NOT to switch to providers offering an "insurance policy" (i.e., fixed price deals) against the volatile and risky power exchange price. When you combine the supply shortage, the PX monopoly, the nonexistant retail market and decision makers' attempts to discourage choice, you get a debacle--that's what California set itself up for, and that's what it got. Putting the PX inside the ISO will only infect the wound that's already been inflicted. The real answer is....(we've developed these points already).   This is quick and dirty and can be made much more punchy and articulate, but wanted to get the notion out there given our time constraints.  Best, Jeff 
 not sure, but i assume that the bluegrass songbook is mine.  is it for guitar? 
 I'll need to ponder.  I'll try to get back to you pronto. 
 FYI.  We have this report? 
 Hi David:  Thought that you might be interested.  Best, Jeff 
 Well, he launched today.  Have you seen the materials from the press conference that he launched today?  I think this is actually a good thing--makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison, makes our support in the process more important, and sets Harvey up as the Ralph Nader equivalent in the election to fix California's broken system---a potential spoiler. 
 Hi.  Well, wouldn't you know it.  I'm not driving tonite, but I bet that we could hitch a ride back with Anil.  I'm not sure, but I think that he's got class tonite, too.  I'll search him out before class or after that break and see if I can set it up.    Carolyn Vavrek <cvavrek@deloitte.com> 11/28/2000 02:41 PM 
 Oh come on.  I heard that you're a ghost writer for Harvey's proposal!  Kidding.  Seriously, it's been great discussing these issues on panels with you lately.  I have a picture of the two of us from the Berkeley conference I'll pass along to you.  I really think there's a way out of all this without dropping a nuclear bomb on all of the hard work folks have done thus far to restructure the industry.  Look forward to working on it.  Best, Jeff  P.S. Don't have TOO much fun dangling the initiative in front of the likes of Peace and the IOUs.     Mike Florio <mflorio@turn.org> 11/28/2000 05:53 PM 
 Hi Aleck:  How did your talk go?  I hope well.  If you're refering to the PX study on whether to have an "as-bid" or "single-price" auction, the PX is in the preliminary stages of having a report prepared.  What they've done is assemble a "Blue Ribbon" panel of economists (as reported in the press accounts you've seen) to examine the issue and report back.  I'm not aware of a report having yet been completed by the panel and submitted to the PX. Have you heard differently?  I'll poke around.  Best, Jeff 
 Thanks, Delaney.  See you on Friday.  Quick comment:  Though just about everything's uncertain these days, folks seem to think that Legislators are likely to get very active just as soon as they arrive in Sacramento (next week?).  Seems that a key--if not dominant--part of the agenda ought to be how this group can (quickly) come to agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the Legislature and the Governor as a pragmatic and positive way out.  Sure you folks are very focused on this, but it struck me that the agenda looks pretty ambitious for a 3-hour meeting.  In any case, just a thought that I wanted to share.  Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts.  Best, Jeff

 left a message.  sense is likely won't release till post-press conference. will keep trying.  jeff 
 Hmmmm, I think you're right.  Looks like the more we can get done tonite, the better.  Perhaps, if we can wrap the analysis up this evening, we can do some serious divvying up of assigments at the end of the meeting.  Then folks can go off and complete the assignments between now and Sunday, which should make Sunday's activities pretty light.  That make any sense?

 In particular, would be nice to know how much of the "wealth transfer" went to the likes of LADWP, other CA munis, Calpine, and the federal government (e.g., BPA, Salt River).

 Let's discuss further, but I believe that the tariff would be a "generic" one for network service, with the price, terms and conditions dependent upon the size and other attributes of the customer.

 PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.  As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis. In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron. The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market. The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious). Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts. The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access. Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any "out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts. All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.  We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.  Thanks, Jeff 
 Glad to hear that there's a meeting set up.  My apologies again.  I'm very wrapped up in trying to help solve California's electricity crisis.  Don't hesitate if there's anything else that I can help out with.  Best, Jeff    mail@joesdesk.com 06/19/2001 06:18 PM 
 Glad to hear it.  Let me know, once you've met, if there's any there there.  Best, Jeff    Joe Kishkill 06/19/2001 06:36 PM

You MUST keep this strictly confidential----I've know Colleen for years. She's a sweet dear friend of mine.  But she's driving me fucking crazy.  I am very happy that you two are buddies and having fun together and that she's being such a big help with your wedding.  But it's going to be best for you and me and Colleen and Scott and Tony Blair and Oprah Winfrey and Sammy Soza, and everyone else, if my contact with the wonderful Ms Silva is minimized in the immediate future.

 Anyone in the market for a $400 hammer?  Alan:  I'd like to use the info ( i.e., "we think the contracts are $XX billion out of the money") in the context of the negotiations that I'm in and I'd also like to tell Hertzberg---it will provide a powerful and compelling case to do something about the contracts in order to 1) save the State's rear end and 2) ensure that the core/noncore structure remains alive. I wouldn't hand out any paper showing any analysis.  How long would it take to refine?  Best, Jeff    Alan Comnes/ENRON@enronXgate 06/19/2001 07:01 PM 
 Recall that at 4:05 PM on Wednesday, June 27th, we are scheduled to see the Giants clobber the bums. 
 Please don't use this yet.  Refinements are underway by Alan Comnes, but wanted to give you a flavor for how underwater the DWR contracts are (if marked to market today).  Jim's got it , too.  Based on recent curves, $21B of the DWR contracts are stranded.  Will give you the update once it's done (likely tomorrow).  Best, Jeff

 Problem is that core has enough through utility retained gen and QF contracts and "noncore" is going to market, so they don't need any of it, which means it's both above market and not needed.    Phillip K Allen/ENRON@enronXgate 06/20/2001 10:09 AM 
 Greetings:  This item will be up for discussion in the California negotiations tomorrow beginning at 10 AM.  We're going to have a call to discuss it tomorrow from 9 AM to 9:30 AM PDT.

 Jay: I'm comfortable with our participation.  Best, Jeff    Jay Ferry@EES 06/20/2001 03:43 PM 
 FYI.  Hertzberg and Keeley were in the negotiations this morning.  We gave him an earful about this coming down the pike, and the fact that the contracts (which are too expensive and which no one wants) are driving everything and unless something gives, we can pack it up, go home and turn the keys over the Freeman and his bozos at DWR.  The Sacramento types are mobilized on the issue and Hertzberg said that he's going to meet with the Governor and call Loretta.  We meet again tomorrow at 10 to discuss the need to get rid of the contracts and to keep DA alive. I'll report back with any pertinent info.  Best, Jeff

Best, Jeff   Enron CEO gets pie in the face from a protester   ? 06/21/2001 Associated Press Newswires    Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. ?  ? SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A Texas energy executive got more than boos and jeers before starting a speech on California's energy crisis, he got a pie in the face. Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., was nailed with a pie by a protester at the beginning of his speech at the Commonwealth Club of California. ?   Enron has come under fire after accusations from Gov. Gray Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply. Enron has denied such claims, and joined other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities owes them billions in unpaid bills. Davis acknowledged that Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which has declared bankruptcy, and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron, Duke Energy, Mirant and Reliant Energy about $2.5 billion for past electricity sales. State officials countered that wholesalers charged as much as $9 billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May 2000. The feuding groups are to meet in a single room next week under a federal order to try and work out agreements that could determine how billions of dollars will be divided. 
 I'll be off on Friday, but will be checking in for messages and will be equipped with pager.  Best, Jeff

 Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis Energy advisers have ruthless reputation Ken Garcia Saturday, June 23, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/06/23/M NN116485.DTL No matter how much you try to spin the facts, the truth usually topples out. This will explain why Gray Davis is suffering from a reality blackout, because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader, who, quite equitably, is suffering his own power crisis. Why Do You Think They Call Him Gray has an unrelenting black-and-white problem. How can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy crisis sooner, his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response to spend $40 million in public funds to purchase future electricity without offering consumers the details of the pact? The truth is, he cannot, although he has tried mightily. And to that end he made one of his biggest mistakes yet -- no small feat when you consider he is at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in California's history. Rather than tackle the issues head-on, Davis did what he has always done: use consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his problems. It's a game Bill Clinton perfected but at which the governor is a mere weekend hobbyist. Davis' decision to hire two former Clinton-Gore spin doctors to explain away his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summer's threat of rolling blackouts. If only, in this case, he could have kept his critics in the dark. While the state's taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills, Davis was pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power suppliers in the Lone Star state who have been soaking California ratepayers dry. It is obviously true that the Bush administration has been reluctant to help the nation's most populous state because it voted for Al Gore in November. And time will probably show that the power companies in Texas and beyond were being Snopes-like in their dealings with the Golden State. But there is no getting around the fact that Davis severely exacerbated California's energy plight through his own inaction -- as evidenced by our sweltering soul mates in San Diego who were experiencing blackouts and spiraling electricity costs early last summer. Yet why suffer the facts when it's so much easier to just scramble them? When the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and Davis' popularity ratings began short-circuiting, he brought in Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, who had been as ubiquitous in the scandal-ridden Clinton administration as the stain on a certain intern's dress. The pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the press each day that they earned the label "masters of disaster" -- which may be why Davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to envelop him. If only he had considered the accompanying stink. Lehane and Fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing less than ruthless, partisan hired guns, happy to attack anyone standing between them and a monthly paycheck. Unfortunately for Davis, the rhetorical hit men's salaries are being paid by California taxpayers, who are none too happy that they will be socked with billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of Davis' lack of leadership. So although Lehane and Fabiani's $30,000 monthly consulting fees may look paltry to a governor who has contributed to California's lost billions, it looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats, sometimes known as California's 30 million-plus residents. The hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group from Sacramento that alleges Lehane and Fabiani are violating the state Political Reform Act because the gunslingers have also worked for Southern California Edison as consultants -- a generally accepted no-no for public officials, even those who worked in Washington. And State Controller Kathleen Connell, a fellow Democrat, has rightfully refused to pay state funds for the Clinton-Gore castoffs, because she said it is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy -- not politics - - as required by law. Until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of ethics, it's fair to say Connell is on pretty firm ground. Or as one member of a tax protest group put it: "We are adding insult to injury to have the governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough for damage control." Damage control is not supposed to incite more damage, but right now Davis is a metal helmet in an electrical storm. His arrogant treatment of state voters, his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his way out of trouble has left even die-hard Democrats searching for a more palatable replacement. That decision will come next year when Davis is up for re-election. And the millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas. Since the governor is involved, it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale. But by the time the spin doctors are through, it may start to sound more like an urban legend.

 If it's no cost to Enron, and if he's good and willing to commute to SF, and if it would be beneficial to the Company, we could certainly use the help and put him to work on interesting things.  But do we we want to infect someone with the lunacy of California regulation and then potentially infect the UK?  Seriously, we can make it work if folks think that it makes sense.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  Can we get a copy?  Best, Jeff   Officials criticize energy report Posted at 8:06 p.m. PDT Thursday, June 28, 2001 BY CHRIS O'BRIEN  Mercury News   California's energy crisis is expected to increase unemployment, reduce production and aggravate an already weakening economy, according to researchers at the University of California-Los Angeles. The impact, however, will likely depend on how state officials choose to deal with the failed deregulation scheme. The authors of the report released Thursday come down heavily in favor of lifting price controls and dramatically increasing the price consumers pay as a way to reduce the economic fallout. ``California's economy is sufficiently large and dynamic that it will weather the current power crisis without being derailed,'' the report says. ``However, our analysis reveals that this impact can be moderated by an approach that does not shift today's problems to tomorrow.'' The study, ``Short Circuit: Will the California Energy Crisis Derail the State's Economy,'' came under fierce criticism from Gov. Gray Davis' office. Steven Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said many of the assumptions used to produce the report are either outdated or flat wrong. ``It deserves its rightful place sitting on the shelf gathering dust,'' Maviglio said. ``Like any crystal-ball report, it's essentially irrelevant.'' Edward Lamer, a UCLA professor, and Christopher Thornberg, a visiting professor at UCLA, collaborated on the report with a team of researchers from the Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The study concludes that California's gross state product will be cut by anywhere from .7 percent to 1.5 percent in 2001 as a result of the energy crisis. In addition, energy problems will increase unemployment by .5 percent in 2001 and 1.1 percent in 2002. The report predicts consumers can expect 112 hours of rolling blackouts this year. However, the report argues that the impact could be dramatically reduced if the state would raise the price consumers pay for energy to match the wholesale costs. This could reduce blackouts to 12 hours, lower the debt and interest the state will have to pay for electricity and encourage investment in the state to increase energy supplies. But Peter Navarro, a management professor at the University of California-Irvine, was skeptical of the report's findings. He said it was almost impossible to build models complex enough to take into account all the factors that affect energy prices in the state. In addition, he said the report seems to assume that there is no manipulation of the current market, which Navarro argues could be distorting prices as well. ``How do you justify raising retail rates to 45 cents for power that costs a nickel to generate when there is some evidence that the market is flawed?'' Navarro said. ``This report seems to have an industry point of view and an industry agenda.''

 i  wish.  leaving to return to SF in a little bit.  should be back in town around 2 PM.  best, Jeff    Joseph Alamo 06/29/2001 12:04 PM 
 Let's discuss further.  I've been in close contact with Chris on this.  I'm not sure that we necessarily need a "presentation" on the issue.  Speaking only for California, policy makers and industry participants know a) that there's a problem and b) that the magnitude of the problem is significant, and there's not a heckuvalot of leg work that needs to be done on that front.  I would suggest that we continue to work on analysis internally, and spend some time discussing further the extent to which we need a presentation for external consumption.  As everyone's aware, this issue is a very complicated one and sensitive one for Enron and we need to be very careful w.r.t. how we approach it.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff

 Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore).  In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on.  That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited "appeals process" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later. This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.  Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as soon as I have more information on that.  Best, Jeff    Susan J Mara 07/03/2001 11:27 AM 
 FYI.  My understanding is that the decisions would actually go out prior to Aug. , with "effective date" in Aug., , thus providing time for the appeals process.  Do others have a similar or different view?  Do we intend to stay in touch, in view of the fact that there's been some "breathing room" provided by the PUC delaying its DA vote, and given the heavy lifting that is still needed to get the core/noncore agreement teed-up and through?  Happy 4th to all.  Best, Jeff 
 It's going to be extremely difficult for anyone who has consumed electricity to avoid paying for it.  It will be particularly difficult for Enron to exempt itself from costs incurred by the state on behalf of Enron's customers.  Prior to us pushing amendments on this bill, can we discuss on the 11:30 call today.

 Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.  Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments. Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to provide the specific language). I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll provide legislative language shortly . Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.  Thoughts?  Best, Jeff    James D Steffes 07/03/2001 02:36 PM 
 chk fax machine for Sher's bond language.  See email, too.  jeff 
 thanks for everything.  really 'ppreciate it, 'migo.   and please thank karen, too.  also, would you tell her that prentice and i are willing and able (we think) to help out in any way we can in putting the fireplace stuff together----i.e., anything that doesn't require real skill, like sticking tiles on the board.  just let us know.  Best, Jeff   tah-mo 
 Thanks.  As you know, I'm in the negotiations.  It's the best chance there is to 1) get a real market and 2) keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  Whether California can execute on it is another story.  But we're trying damned hard to make it happen.  IEP should support it.  Anything that you can do with Jan would be useful and appreciated.  Best, Jeff    David Parquet@ECT 07/05/2001 12:12 PM

 Greetings:  Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.  I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X. The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.  I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:  Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds.  In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.  Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.  For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.  I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.  In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.  With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.  Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?  Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.  Best, Jeff 
 Please take a look and see if you think it does what we're after.  I'd like to share with folks as soon as possible to try to get something in the bill.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  From today's Post.  Davis seems to continue to put distance between himself and the contracts.  Best, Jeff ********************************************************************** Financial California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks Peter Behr ? 07/06/2001 The Washington Post FINAL Page E01 Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. "We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. "You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion." The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. "What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress," according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. "There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. "It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room "billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.

 Senate Majority Leader Eager to Push Energy, Environmental Issues James Kuhnhenn  ? 07/06/2001 KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Knight Ridder's Washington Bureau    Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM) ?  ? WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's approach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle wants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda, before other initiatives popular with Democrats. Daschle's aides and party strategists say the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, draw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation and alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' charges that it has ignored the country's energy needs. Activists on both sides see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sign.    "With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you go with," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's an issue that people actually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics." Democrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House. Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bush is handling energy and environmental issues. What's more, the House of Representatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed with support from 70 Republicans. "When the Republican-controlled House soundly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center," said Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn. The decision to highlight energy policy came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key committees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum wage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and other issues popular with their supporters. But concentrating on energy policy first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican issue and turn it to their advantage, aides said. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From the moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energy needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden to special interests. "The White House and Republicans are in the 35 percent end of public opinion on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for the Republicans." With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources committee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. It will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in May. The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as next week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Department. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fending off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling near Florida beaches and on national monument lands. The White House helped defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling back its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge disagreements remain over drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Interior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge. Democrats also want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservation and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for sport utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel economy standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later this month. The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle extra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republicans such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservation measures than the White House proposes. "He'll be very prominent in cobbling a centrist coalition on the issue," said Marshall Wittman, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute research center and a political adviser to McCain. "You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- encouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environmentally friendly." The White House already has reacted to the criticism of its energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spending for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He also has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for spending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget. But the president is not backing away from his position that the United States needs to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energy plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alaskan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay for research into alternative energy sources. In addition to public disapproval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing the sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rolling blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and last week John Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call for new oil refineries. That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for quick solutions. "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a political scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Like the patients' bill of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, energy right now "is low-hanging fruit," he said.

 Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the "core/noncore" proposal in California.  The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.  Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.) Work done by the "Plan B" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend. Because no proposal is "comprehensive," a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, "Plan B," Edison MOU) In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a "conference committee," comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th. July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc. The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a "thought piece" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the "thought piece" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.) All of this is still up in the air, however.  As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process. 
 Thanks very much Mike.  The sense of urgency for getting this in "the mix" is not as high as it was yesterday, though we'll still need to introduce it at some point very soon.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff    MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com> 07/06/2001 01:12 PM

    California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel Taub Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a misdirected e-mail. The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list, he said. Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accurate. Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day-ahead market. The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.

 USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.  07/06/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  (changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement) SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million for power already sold. Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the announcement. As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under the contracts, will be elevated to "administrative priority status," a claim which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors. Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now, Calpine said. The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state with a series of rolling blackouts. Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour. The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's power plants are qualifying facilities. These types of facilities represent more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities. "Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these affordable and reliable energy resources," Calpine senior vice president James Macias said in a statement.

Best, Jeff ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Campaign funds will pay for spots Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, July 7, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport. Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an "information void" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis. "The campaign season has started early," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots running since June 19. Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an "energy update," where the governor informs listeners that "we" have licensed 16 new power plants, including three Davis opened this month, and that "conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices." Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed "Flex Your Power" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using state money to finance his political ambitions. South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square. "One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack," South said, "is that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am mood." Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own. "These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public service ads, very much are political ads," Stutzman said. "The reason they may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think he has any credibility on this issue." Davis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com, which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show "The West Wing." The Sheen photo dominates the home page. "What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it," said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President Bush in 2004. Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis and saying the state was suffering from "Grayouts." Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as Reliant Energy of "unconscionable price-gouging." Reliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the ads running in California through July. Scott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a call for comment yesterday. Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls. But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy. Davis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull dramatically increased. Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy supply, more drilling and nuclear energy. The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader. Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a "conservative, market- oriented message" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between supply and demand, except through strict conservation. "We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so far," Gillespie said. E-mail Robert Salladay at rsalladay@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Page A - 6 
 Apologies folks, but upon re-reading, I caught some ambiguities and inaccuracies in the first draft that I sent around.  Sure that  errors remain, but this version should at least be somewhat closer.  Changes are in strike-out-underline.  Best, Jeff 
 Below is an update from the weekend's activities.  The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format. The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT). The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday). As expected, some in the group are attempting to "recontract" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin. The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal. Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis. In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially. Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.  Best, Jeff 
 you have made me very happy. 
 Since it was only Friday since Delainey directed me to send info directly to him, I included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking like I was disobeying direct orders 48 hours after receiving them.  Hopefully we can work something out where you distribute as you deem fit.  Hope it's not creating undue headaches.  Best, Jeff 
 i'll be participating.  thanks.  Best, Jeff 
 Last time I was in Houston, an IT tech deleted everything---I mean everything---so I need to hunt it down.  Will do so immediately and get you a copy. Best, Jeff 
 Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help.  Best, Jeff    Richard Shapiro 07/09/2001 01:46 PM 
 This looks like LA Times/Wall Street Journal material...... 
 Thanks.  I have minor, but substantive, edits to the direct access section that Dorothy did, which I believe more accurately capture the document that we previously delivered to Hertzberg and the discussions around that document.  My proposed edits will be distributed to everyone within the next 30-60 minutes.  Thanks to Delaney for all the work.  Best, Jeff 
 P.S.  Have discussed with Dorothy and will attempt to capture in my proposed edits our discussion.  Best, Jeff    Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 07/09/2001 03:48 PM 
 Legislative package only delays pain, critics warn By Craig D. Rose UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER September 1, 2000 Consumer and political leaders -- as well as Sempra Energy's chief executive -- said yesterday that the three electricity bills before Gov. Gray Davis do nothing to fix the fundamental cause of soaring bills. The cause, they say, is that power generators can continue to charge what most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity -- and consumers ultimately face the daunting task of paying them. No matter if all of the bills are signed, the leaders say California's power market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers. And while San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s hard-pressed customers may pay less now, they will pay back all or nearly all the savings -- plus interest -- beginning in 2003. "The governor's bill postpones the pain, but the pain is still there," said Maureen O'Connor, a former mayor of San Diego who has been active in seeking relief from the soaring bills afflicting SDG&E's 1.2 million electricity customers. The rate bill promoted by Davis and now awaiting his signature will have SDG&E's customers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, or 70 percent more than what they paid as recently as May. Power companies, however, will continue to charge the customers as they have; presently, they're charging about 21 cents per kilowatt hour for SDG&E customers. The difference between 6.5 cents and whatever prices above that level emerge from the state's volatile power market will be recorded as IOUs for each customer in so-called balancing accounts. A second bill before the governor could provide up to $150 million in state money to help pay the balancing accounts, but the bulk of the IOUs will almost certainly be paid by SDG&E customers themselves when they become due in 2003 or 2004. A third bill before the governor would speed the construction of power plants. So while the rate bill lets customers pay less now than they owe, it obligates them to pay the balance with interest later. The situation creates the potential for a troublesome compounding effect: The higher electricity prices grow, the more is set aside in the balancing accounts -- and the greater the wallop to customer wallets when the accounts come due. Based upon prices now paid for future electric deliveries, Sempra Energy estimates customers will owe $664 million by 2003. IOUs of that magnitude, said SDG&E, will require that customers pay a surcharge of $40 monthly for a year on top of whatever they are already paying for their power bills. Keep in mind that typical residential bills at this time last year were about $55; they now stand at about $130. Consumer advocates say it's likely power prices will remain at levels that will lead to huge debts for customers under the Davis proposal. "The generators have shown themselves to be unconscionable in extorting profits," said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, a San Francisco-based consumer group. Hoge said the bills that emerged "seemed the best a corrupt system could spit out." She added that TURN and other groups will shift their focus to pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restrain the electric generating companies and wholesale power markets. FERC, she said, must legally determine if charges from generating companies are reasonable. TURN and other groups will also press for re-regulation of the industry and will begin to explore municipally owned generating plants. Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network supports the Davis bill, although he said it won't fix "the almost irreparably broken California energy system." "The problem is that California's electricity customers have been subjected to market prices in a dysfunctional energy market," Shames said. "It's a market controlled by the sellers of power and their cronies." But Shames said the Davis bill provides at least temporary protection against further rate shocks, and he expects taxpayers across the state will ultimately assist SDG&E's customers in paying their electricity bills. But Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which has called for re-regulation of the industry, opposes the rate-cap legislation. "This keeps ratepayers and taxpayers on the hook for the costs," said Court, who added that the bill also locks in near doubling of power rates compared to last year. Stephen Baum, chief executive officer of Sempra, said the bill puts SDG&E -- a Sempra subsidiary -- in the position of financing the difference between what power companies charge for their power and what it collect from customers over the next three years. The balancing accounts, Baum said, could grow so large that they will challenge Sempra's ability to borrow to cover them. "The problem is with the wholesale markets," said Baum, who today becomes chairman as well as chief executive of Sempra. "This legislation does nothing but postpone a big bill." He added that Sempra believed the bill included ambiguities that could be illegal if not later clarified by the California Public Utilities Commission. "If (the PUC) can't or won't, then I think the legislation is legally flawed and can't stand," Baum said.

 may have been updated a bit prior to the presentation, but yep, that's it. will do for now.  please forward to rick.  when i'm back in the office i'll do more searching.  thanks a bunch.  i'm assuming this is what he's referring to.  Best, Jeff 
 Folks: Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.  They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding "spot market service" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as "an option to elect."  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a "backstop," in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.  Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any "stakes in the ground" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.  In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., "what to do about DA in the interm?"  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.  Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.  Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).  Best, Jeff 
 "Sacramento or Salem?"  Sort of has a nice ring to it. 
 No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.  Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost limit.  Thanks very much for the comments.

 The Bond Legislation The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts. But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along. The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so Republican votes are necessary. The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.  The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal. Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain. No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to "give it a chance."  The Core/Noncore Legislative Language The negotiating group continues to work on the language. The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning.  Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.  Best, Jeff 
 Hi.  Thanks for the note.  Couple of things.  Prentice is going to do Xmas with us this year cuz her family will be out of town.  So we should absolutely include her, but I think she really wants to be included in the "picking" so that she gets someone's name.  If you'd like to pick the names and let people know, I'm completely comfortable with that.  (Confidentially, I have a great idea for Mike, so if, by chance, I get him as a pick, that would be great!)  Also, let me throw this out.  You know that if I didn't live in a 1-bedroom apartment, I'd host (and hopefully, we'll be having Xmas at my place in Mendocino a few years down the road).  Steve and Charry really carry the load all the time.  Have you considered opening presents and having dinner at your place?  I'd be happy to take care of the meal, and hang around to clean up afterwards.  No big deal, just a thought.  Alternatively, we could absolutely have it at Prentice's apartment, which is plenty big enough, and will have a big beautiful tree, etc.  So give that a thought.  Might be nice to do it in the city, and we'd be happy to host it there, too.  Now, the important stuff.  What do Katie and Michael want/need for Xmas?

 It's a hell hole, whaddya think?  Be great if you stopped by.  Just let me know when you're going to be here.  Love to have dinner and catch up.  You involved at all with the gas infrastructure stuff that's going on at the Cal PUC.  If not, I think that you should be.  Now that Fawcett has left TW and Susan Scott's in our shop in Houston with Christie, I'm a little concerned about TW (I don't have as much time to monitor anymore).  Be great if you got involved.  Hope all is well with you and yours.  Best, Jeff

 California; Metro Desk Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show. RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH TIMES STAFF WRITERS  07/10/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company  SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California. Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. "You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with "moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy."

 Mark, Congratulations on the story in the Times.  FYI.  Today's radio media (local and national) are all giving the same basic message that:  "Davis got beat up in FERC negotiations; judge sides decidedly with generators; Davis team trying in vain to spin it their way, but it's clear they lost. "  Freeman was pathetic on the radio this morning.  Interviewers weren't buying his BS at all.  Best, Jeff 
 Only couple brief comments on the version that includes Edison's comments:  Under the definition of "Spot Market Service" it now reads:  This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service.  I don't understand the meaning of the phrase "or be deemed to elect."  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.  There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term. Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a "zone of comfort" around including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted to briefly flag it).  Thanks again for all the effort.  Best, Jeff 
 any sense of why all the pulling? 
 Found the final.  Don't know if it differs from the one distributed yesterday.  Best, Jeff

Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chief=20 administrative law judge, said that at the same time the power suppliers=20 probably are owed more than that.  The net effect of his preliminary recommendation is that California probabl= y=20 will receive no refunds from wholesalers.  Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in refunds. The state= =20 has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said he will not recommen= d=20 refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.  It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary=20 recommendation would have on efforts to settle the dispute.  Both sides said before the judge's announcement that they expected a=20 protracted legal battle in the event the talks did not produce a settlement= .  Michael Kahn, Gov.

The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are grossly=20 inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- Duke Energy, Dynegy,=20 Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos.-- said in a statement that the= y=20 have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."  John H. Stout, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company= =20 would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall= =20 settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal= =20 claims.  But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains= =20 that no refunds are justified."  FERC ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences betwe= en=20 producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated=20 electricity market.

RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ and DOUG SMITHS TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse grou= p=20 of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who h= as=20 aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show.  During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of= =20 power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private=20 entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid t= o=20 Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the= =20 Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.  Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per= =20 megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas= &=20 Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe= r,=20 the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour=20 charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292= =20 an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies=20 singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc.,= =20 Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid= =20 for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe= r=20 megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.  The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased= =20 by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more= =20 than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencie= s.  Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest= =20 barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have=20 reaped the highest profits over the longest period.  "You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.  "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the=20 generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%= =20 above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are chargi= ng=20 us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting=20 ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."  The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times o= n=20 the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's=20 electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first=20 quarter.  The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in th= e=20 first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's= =20 energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited= =20 to a few generators.  Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the=20 reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year= .=20 "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs sin= ce=20 his agency began buying power in mid-January.  The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 = in=20 January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour t= o=20 $271, the reports show.  In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded= =20 those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, o= ne=20 of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per=20 megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, = a=20 total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.  By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a=20 megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average=20 charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.  A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of= =20 Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not b= e=20 reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past,= =20 the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered=20 last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.  A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,= =20 said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to se= e=20 the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reach= ed=20 Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing= =20 the power needed by the state were extremely high.  More Power Bought Than Projected  Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,= =20 coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas= =20 prices, have begun to tame the state's market.  Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,=20 about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.  Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply proble= ms=20 in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of stat= e=20 projections in June and early July.  The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June= =20 and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well und= er=20 $100 a megawatt-hour.

Firm says it's complying. CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 10 2001  SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price=20 gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy= =20 is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigatio= n.  Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding informatio= n=20 from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But= =20 under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public withou= t=20 Duke's consent.  The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have=20 alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days i= n=20 January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the=20 electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing througho= ut=20 the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation a= nd=20 efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential=20 information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public.  Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tha= t=20 gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and= =20 which stay secret.  "The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by wh= at=20 is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.  Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers  Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the informati= on=20 elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."  Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last mont= h=20 under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh= at=20 seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.  But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=20 California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity= =20 grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its=20 explanation.  Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full= =20 picture of the plant's operation during the three days.  But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging,= =20 said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed dat= a,=20 Duke was guilty of the same tactics.  "Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full=20 picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions= =20 until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said.  To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive= =20 up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke=20 submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the= =20 expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.  Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in=20 California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and=20 off-limits to legislators not on the committee.  Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to=20 comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke= =20 would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records t= he=20 committee plans to turn over.  "We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we ar= e=20 leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't= =20 know what we are ultimately going to do."  The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they= =20 provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, ha= ve=20 said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant,= =20 were cited.  Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are=20 trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formal= ly=20 charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is th= e=20 final arbiter of such issues.  Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited= =20 for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines.

DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER  July 9 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Even as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gra= y=20 Davis prepares for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch= =20 on a new power plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly= =20 more daunting task of balancing the books.  It's a task with potentially far more long-lasting implications for state= =20 coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for consumers' wallets.  In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by the governor's office= =20 as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-control electricity=20 market are having the opposite effect politically. A growing concern about= =20 the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicating one of Davis' mo= st=20 ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial rescue of Southern=20 California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate in the Legislature= .=20 Questions about the contracts come as California readies a complex=20 $13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund for other pow= er=20 purchases.  Critics worry that costs embedded in the contracts, on top of the billions= =20 needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead to additional electricity= =20 rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer advocates and business=20 lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pacts be renegotiated.  Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these critics say the sta= te=20 should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the= =20 prices. They argue that the state entered into the deals under duress after= =20 California's utilities neared insolvency and the state Department of Water= =20 Resources took over the purchasing of electricity for more than 25 million= =20 residents.  "They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen=20 (D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state struck with independent power=20 companies when prices were at record highs.  Bowen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing "the best deals th= ey=20 could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiation= s=20 took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50."  Contracts Open to Challenges  The contracts could be challenged in court or, more immediately, before the= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. There, an administrativ= e=20 law judge could direct that the pacts be reworked as part of a settlement o= f=20 allegations by Davis that generators overcharged the state for electricity = by=20 $8.9 billion.  "We ought not to say, 'Fine, the contracts were the best we could do,' "=20 Bowen said.  For his part, Davis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.= 9=20 billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He= =20 attributes the recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to=20 conservation, the administration's effort to increase power supply and--a= =20 major factor--the long-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance o= n=20 the volatile daily, or spot, market.  "You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . . dramatically=20 shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Californians," Davis= =20 said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30% from May to= =20 June.  Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped negotiate the contracts,= =20 said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, given the recent declin= e=20 in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for California's=20 electricity-generating plants.  Freeman also compared critics to someone who calls the fire department to= =20 douse a blaze. "After the fire is out," he said, "you complain about the=20 water damage."  The contracts have other defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics=20 professor Severin Borenstein, who says the deals helped to tame the volatil= e=20 spot market by reducing generators' incentive to drive up prices, while=20 reducing the state's exposure to wild swings in price.  "The point of signing long-term contracts is not to get a great price; it's= =20 to reduce risk," Borenstein said.  Still, experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior=20 Court judge in San Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit= =20 by news organizations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Dav= is=20 unseal the contracts.  An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each representing= =20 Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group; a= nd=20 large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-billion price tag= =20 announced by the administration may not account for all the costs. When oth= er=20 expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equipment upgrades to= =20 any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an additional 10% to= =20 20%.  "Once the contracts were made public," Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte = of=20 Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who can read began calling for=20 those contracts to be renegotiated."  As buyers' remorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly= =20 are seen as a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront= =20 fast-approaching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis fro= m=20 morphing into a broader financial crisis.  A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptcy for the financially hobbled=20 Southern California Edison must be approved by Aug. 15. The deadline could = be=20 tighter, because the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a monthlong=20 break July 20.  Davis' rescue plan, along with legislative alternatives, languishes in the= =20 Legislature. The plan, which has little apparent support, would require the= =20 state to buy Edison's system of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and=20 permit the utility to charge ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3= .5=20 billion.  Some lobbyists and lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approve= d=20 in March by the California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a=20 kilowatt-hour the largest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue= =20 generated under the new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-ter= m=20 power contracts and repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would b= e=20 the largest municipal deal ever.  Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for the Edison rescue= =20 remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may need to seek a=20 separate rate hike to cover its costs.  As written, the contracts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk= =20 away from them if he concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism= =20 persists and crosses political lines.  Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers Union, and Jack=20 Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn.,=20 rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in separate=20 interviews, they sounded similar themes.  "If there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts, even if we have t= o=20 pay damages, we'd be better off in the long run," Snyder said.  Stewart, like other business leaders, does not advocate abrogating the=20 contracts. But like many familiar with the terms, he hopes that some deals= =20 can be renegotiated.  "They are problematic," he said.  In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricity prices for the= =20 next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC to agree within a= =20 month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the Department o= f=20 Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.  State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the= =20 $13.4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Stre= et=20 investors can be assured that they will be repaid.  "The state will be out of cash by the end of the year without the bond sale= ,"=20 he said. "We will move toward fiscal insolvency."  The so-called rate agreement, a draft of which was obtained by The Times,= =20 would bind customers of the three big regulated utilities to pay more than= =20 just the principal and interest on the $13.4 billion in bonds. Consumers=20 would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to pay taxes, fees and other=20 as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by the Department of Water=20 Resources.  Additionally, the PUC would be obligated to approve payments for programs b= y=20 which the state would pay large and small customers to cut electricity use,= =20 although the Legislature has not approved the programs and their details=20 remain to be worked out. The Department of Water Resources estimates the co= st=20 to be $800 million, spread over this year and next.  "It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco)= =20 said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would require the commission= =20 to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water Resources decides= =20 to do."  "That is giving a blank check to some bureaucratic office," he said.  'Dictatorial Power' Warning  Stewart of the manufacturers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it= =20 would provide the water agency with "dictatorial power."  "As skeptical as we are of the PUC process, at least there is a process,"= =20 Stewart said, referring to the commission's procedures to set electricity= =20 rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR just tells the PUC, 'This is what = we=20 need,' and the PUC must approve it."  Others say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the=20 extraordinary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the= =20 Department of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so= =20 deeply into debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to=20 consumers.

With no settlement, the matter is now i= n=20 the commissioners' hands.=20 Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 million in=20 refunds, an offer the state rejected.

Kahn=20 brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory in the judge's assertion tha= t=20 the state is owed some refunds, a concept the generators have been unwillin= g=20 to embrace up to now, he said.=20 Since the talks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week= =20 Duke Energy offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed= =20 their refund offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the= =20 company were dropped.=20 But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that California i= s=20 no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price gouging by power= =20 companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks began.=20 And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the FERC.

"I've never considered that=20 anything more than a wild number to throw out there."=20 The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of overcharges because th= ey=20 are using different assumptions about how to compute the complex pricing=20 structure.

 Published Tuesday, July 10,  2001     State discloses spot power  buys  By Andrew  LaMar TIMES STAFF WRITER   SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power  sales of $922,000 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District to more than $1  billion of power sold by Atlanta-based Mirant power company.  All told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices.  In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.

 FYI. In bizarre times, help can sometimes come from bizarre places.  Granted, we're likely to disagree strongly with Hogan's continued obsession with Poolco, but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be helpful---I've read the Joskow paper, but haven't yet had a chance to review the Hogan piece.  Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the Joskow/Kahn "analysis"  (remember it's Ed Kahn, not Alfred Kahn).  Seems that it would be very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power included in the paper done by Hogan & Co.  If, in the end, there ain't nothing useful, so be it.  But seems like there's little downside to exploring it.  Jim, my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper.  Might want to include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull Seabron Adamson into the thinking, too.  Ultimately, may be preferable to have any assessment of Joskow and/or Hogan to come from economists, rather than directly from us.  Best, Jeff 
 FYI.  Please keep confidential until further notice.  Important to note that this was delivered with the understanding that NO ONE has agreed to the specific language.  It was a quick turn around (at Hertzberg's request) to get the original, negotiated agreement into Legislative language (i.e., Martian) as soon as possible so that Hertzberg could try to move on it in the Legislature as soon as possible.  In addition, the Commission is likely to come out with its proposed "rate agreement" sometime this week, and is likely to release DWR's "revenue requirement" next week.  I heard from the Gov's financial advisor that Edison and DWR EACH want 2 cents out of the PUC's recent 3 cent rate increase.  It's going to get very interesting from here.  Best, Jeff 
 Great first cut.  Thanks very much.  Keep 'em coming.  Best, Jeff 
 Kean going to need to see the letter and comment before it goes out?  Jeff 
 Folks.  I'm working on it, but it's going to require quite a bit of work. Please chk your emails later this evening for the next draft.  I'll page folks--those with pagers, that is--to notify when I've emailed it.  Scott, please inform Hedy and Bev.  Best, Jeff

 LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis  Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones   By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country, raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a megawatt-hour - about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances in which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's cash-strapped utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing the LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from Jan. 18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those charged by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized repeatedly as price gougers.  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that the LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became Davis' top energy adviser.  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's two largest utilities.  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators."  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return calls for comment.  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.  Power To Sell   According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling power to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed in throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but only needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as much as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators were charging.  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt and will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in an interview last year.  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid, the LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001 by as much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the utility.  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying the costs of producing electricity were extremely high.  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement talks between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous sums selling surplus power to California at the last minute.  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires  07-10-01  1557EDT  (AP-DJ)--07-10-01 1557EDT :TICKER: EIX PCG SRE :SUBJECT: EUTL CA COBO MU PETR Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones and Company, Inc.

Best, Jeff ************************************************************************* Power purchase bills exceed $7.5 billion Published Tuesday, July 10, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News BY MARK GLADSTONE, NOAM LEVEY AND DION NISSENBAUM  Mercury News Sacramento Bureau   SACRAMENTO -- Six months after jumping into the electricity business, the Davis administration on Monday provided the first detailed glimpse of California's daily power purchases, showing more than $5 billion in payments, much of it to government-owned utilities and private companies that state officials have branded as price gougers. The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts and other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets, according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a legal dispute over public access to the data. In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2 billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro in British Columbia. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have arisen around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the state's purchases have come from government-run power generators in California and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are from the Northwest. Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, has put much of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in President Bush's home state. The figures are tucked inside 1,770 of pages of invoices that Davis has resisted divulging, saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge more. The state, which last month released information on its long-term electricity contracts worth $43 billion, agreed Thursday to release the first quarter details. Short on explanation The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Water Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major utilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for what prompted the decrease. In January, for instance, the average price for power on the spot market was $321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $332 and dropped to $271 in May. One megawatt powers about 750 homes. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's assertions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant shift of money out of California.'' But the documents fail to shed much light on whether, as the administration contends, the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by the state earlier this year. Critics contend that the Davis administration panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for many years. Used for support Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks against Davis, a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down, partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many plants. ``It's more clear than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,'' said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years.'' The newly released bills highlight the volatility of California's energy market, where the price per megawatt hour ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any given day, the records show, the prices from seller to seller varied widely, with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and companies outside Texas. On one day in February, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was charging $165 per megawatt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was charging nearly $500 and Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was charging up to $575. The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power, including the spot market and contracted power. The state began buying power in mid-January on behalf of the state's major utilities, which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing enormous debts for electricity. San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which is building several new power plants around California including one in South San Jose, did only $29 million worth of business with the state in the first five months of the year, according to the figures. The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. were on the ropes financially. PG&E later went into bankruptcy. On Monday, state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a plan to rescue financially ailing Edison. While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison will not win the necessary support in the Legislature, lawmakers have created several working groups to come up with alternatives. Compromise plan On Monday, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, unveiled the latest compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help finance the Edison bailout. The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, owed about $1 billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive about $300 million in Edison debts. Edison would be asked to swallow $1.2 billion -- about a third of its debt. And big users would be asked to pay off the remaining $2 billion in debts, possibly by paying higher prices for power. In exchange, large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on the open market, a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy deals. Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday afternoon, but it remains unclear how much support the framework will receive in the Legislature.

 Dan Walters: Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality continues   (Published July 11, 2001) California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis, to wit: The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than it can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of dollars to cover the debt. There is a strong possibility, perhaps a probability, that when summer's heat truly descends, there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners demand more juice than California can generate or buy. One major utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has filed for bankruptcy protection and a second, Southern California Edison, is on the brink of joining it. There is, however, a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin, media leaks and made-for-television buzz words -- and it is rapidly becoming dominant, while the real situation fades into the background. This week's comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality and everything to do with the virtual version. Gov. Gray Davis and other officials demanded $8.9 billion in refunds from the generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past year, alleging that California is, in Davis' words, "being gouged and ripped off." But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air -- an arithmetic exercise by the state power grid's traffic controller not intended for a refund proceeding. And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealistic, Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity. "There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed. But that's a far cry from the $8.9 billion that Davis insists is due. "If you think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds, we will see you in court," Davis said Tuesday. Why is Davis being so belligerent? Because it's good politics. Ever since he began berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off California, Davis' approval ratings have been climbing. If he settled for substantially less -- the power generators probably would agree to a couple of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter -- Davis would be embarrassed. Politically, he's served by continuing to portray himself as fighting for California and against the out-of-state generators. That it's more political construct than reality is indicated by another event this week, Davis' release of state power purchase data from early in the year -- numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do it. Davis and his minions have been accusing Texas-based generators and power brokers of particularly egregious price gouging -- clearly playing on Californians' instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texan George W. Bush is a co-conspirator. But the power purchase records -- which were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee -- indicate that less than 10 percent of California's power purchase dollars were going to Texas and the private sellers, in general, charged the state less than such publicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not, however, deterring Davis from continuing to operate, at least for public consumption, in the melodramatic virtual world. One cannot, however, ignore reality forever. The likelihood of a pro-generator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for Davis, or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from slipping into bankruptcy court. The Legislature has refused to act on the Edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utility's debts would be slimmed down by FERC. This week's farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will stall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the utility into bankruptcy court later this summer. That's part of that nasty old reality that cannot simply be wished away.  The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com . 
 You bet.  Got your and Fran's messages.  If you'd like to discuss by phone, I'm in all day.  Otherwise, I suggest that we do take the following next steps:  Just as soon as you have the proposal and list of participants drafted (which I hope will be very soon), please forward to me. Then, as quickly as possible, I'd like to have a meeting to discuss and finalize the proposal.  It would be very useful if Laura Tyson could be in on that final meeting, and, of course, any other of the participants that you'd like to invite.  We're are somewhat behind the eight ball due to the delays thus far in getting this thing off the ground.  If we're going to do it, it's going to have to come together quickly, and the report will have to be developed very quickly, too.  Hope that will be possible.  I'm assuming at this point that you and I are proceeding ahead absent Mitch and Carl, since they have sensitive issues with their clients that we can't seem to overcome?  And I'll inquire about the need for expert witnesses in the class action suit  and get back to you.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  You may have read that Calpine is close to reaching a deal with the state on its overcharges (about $240MM).  Note from structuring's analysis that Alan sent around that Calpines share of the stranded costs is about 45% of the total amount of stranded costs arising from the DWR contracts.  That is, of the $9.5B (present value) of stranded costs, the Calpine contracts account for about $4.4B  So, in exchange for settling on $240MM, Calpine gets $4.4 B.  Nice work if you can get it.

  State energy contracts must be paid off by users in system  By Ed Mendel SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 12, 2001   SACRAMENTO -- California businesses are being hit by big electricity rate increases, some as high as 100 percent, and they would like to be able to shop around for cheaper power.   But state regulators are poised to ban customer choice, or "direct access" as it has come to be called, because they want to make sure that enough customers remain with utilities to pay for state power purchases.   After a month of closed-door talks, the revelation that the state has signed $43 billion worth of long-term power contracts at above-market prices helped scuttle an attempt to work out a compromise in the Assembly.        * <http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/reports/power/20010712-9999_7m12correct. html> For the record: Power story correction  * <http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/reports/power/20010712-9999_1n12enron.ht ml> Senate panel, energy firm fighting tough   <http://www.signonsandiego.com/images/trans_1x1.gif>  "If the intent of the big customers is to leave the small customers paying for those contracts, we are going to fight like hell," said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network.   Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, said large business users were offering to pay off the back debt of Southern California Edison, estimated at $3.5 billion, in exchange for direct access.   "I thought we were making a lot of progress until the information on the contracts came out," Stewart said. "We really don't have a way of dealing with those contracts."   Now Stewart is suggesting that direct access be slowly phased in over a period of years and that the long-term power contracts be renegotiated, perhaps with some being switched from the state to big-business users.   The manufacturers association and the California Chamber of Commerce helped organize a business coalition, Californians for Energy Action, that wants a cheaper alternative to power purchased for utility customers by the state.   "Many large and small California businesses have seen their electric bills double," says a newspaper ad being run by the coalition this week. "These cost increases are a burden that will cause consumer prices to increase, some businesses to fail and jobs to be lost."   A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission for PG&E and Edison customers in May fell heaviest on business users. The PUC said that the average residential increase was about 50 percent, while the average business increase was about 75 percent.   Legislation that authorized the state to begin buying power in January for the utilities, who were crippled by a failed deregulation plan, bars rate increases for residential customers who use up to 130 percent of the baseline, the minimal amount deemed necessary for a household.   Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San Francisco, and other legislators have argued that large businesses should bear most of the burden of the failed deregulation plan because it was business, not residential consumers, who pushed for deregulation.   Alan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said that forcing businesses to bear a "disproportionate" rate increase will cost everyone through higher prices for goods and services and possibly a loss of jobs.   "If government didn't allow implementation of deregulation in the right manner," Zaremberg said, "then we all have to find a solution. We are all in this together, and that's residential and business alike."   The legislation that authorized the state to buy power also directed the PUC to ban direct access power purchases, if the loss of rate revenue from the departing customers would harm the ability to pay off a power bond.   The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in September or October to repay the taxpayer-supported state general fund for power purchases. The bond would be paid off by ratepayers over 15 years.   Last week, the Senate rejected a bill by Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, on a 19-12 vote that would have allowed businesses to shop for power if they paid an "exit fee" to protect the bond payments. Business groups said the fee was too large and would not result in lower power costs.   "I cannot carry a direct-access bill that makes it harder to sell the bonds or that shifts costs from large users, who leave for cheaper power, to smaller users and residential ratepayers," Bowen said.   Burton and Bowen have both criticized Gov. Gray Davis' plan to keep Southern California Edison from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in bankruptcy. They say the plan, which includes the state purchase of the Edison transmission system, is too generous to Edison.   Both Burton and Bowen have suggested that an Edison bankruptcy may not be a calamity. But in the Assembly, Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, launched a drive for an alternative Edison rescue plan that was based on gaining business support by offering direct access.   Hertzberg asked a former Democratic assemblyman, Phil Isenberg of Sacramento, to try to work out an agreement among the various special interest groups: business, labor, consumers and generators.   The basic plan considered by the Isenberg group would have left "core" customers -- residences and small businesses -- in a regulated system receiving power at stable prices from the generators and contracts retained by the utilities.   Businesses and other large users, the "non-core" customers, would be free to shop around for low-cost power by 2003 if they agreed to help pay off the Edison debt.   The Edison rate increase for large users would be limited to 50 percent. The PUC would create a "balancing account" to track costs, issuing a refund if too much was collected or raising rates if revenue fell short.   Business and generator groups told Hertzberg last week that they reached agreement on a general framework, with the exception of the state purchase of the Edison transmission system and some other issues. But the consumer and labor representatives opposed the framework.   Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network said in a dissenting statement that an across-the-board allocation of state power costs would be "clearly unfair" and cause residential users to subsidize direct-access customers.   Hertzberg said he is considering some of the ideas in the framework presented by the Isenberg group and may make a proposal in a week or two.   "We are looking at all the possibilities," Hertzberg said. "We are trying to do some form of direct access within the current contract structure." 
 Talked to Dave.  In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he sees it.  It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key points: Based on an expectation that the "expedited siting" bill would help site plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.  The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm requirement. The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or 2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting). In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO (which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of going to the market, thus killing the economics. On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that "...it be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and maintain the plant," it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is (i.e, before the project has been approved), and, it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks prefer).  In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.  Point 2 in bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public.  If any questions, let me know.  Bruno has emailed the price cap and the "general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap" bills, and faxed the siting bill.  Best, Jeff

 FYI.  California takes it in the chin from the FERC judge.  Best, Jeff 
 Thank you SO much.  This is it.  Really appreciate it. 
 here it is.  sorry, thought it had been forwarded this to you previously.  best, jeff 
 Please forward to others who need this information.  As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.  Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group. The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is attached) are:  Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill) Transmission sale at 2X book. Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by customers 20KW and above. Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, investigations, etc.) The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts and what the payment structure will look like.  Reaction and Timetable Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility. Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed Republicans are strongly opposed Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access. Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. AB82XX does not address this issue. Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "modified MOU." Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their "modified" MOU this weekend or early next week. The Assembly will hold an "informational" hearing on the bill tomorrow (Saturday) to get members up to speed The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on Tuesday. The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working  Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in Sacramento.

 Calif DWR Seen Asking PUC To Order 25% Rate Increase Fri By Jason Leopold  07/13/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This article was originally published earlier Friday.)  LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources, the agency purchasing a bulk of the state's power needs in lieu of the three investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%.  This is because there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream to cover a $13.4 billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public Utilities Commission told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday.  PUC President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue a draft decision Friday either endorsing the rate hike request or calling for an audit of the DWR's current revenue stream before she makes a decision, aides in her office said.  If the PUC determines that there are not enough funds in the current rate structure to cover the bond sale, it will have no choice but to order the rate increase, according to the legislation that put the state in the power buying business.  Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in just two months, if approved by the PUC, the commissioners said. "Back in May when we ordered the first rate increase, we said we may be forced to do it again by the summer," one commissioner said.  "It's unfortunate, but it shouldn't be a shock to anyone. The state has made an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up whenever it's needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds."  Lynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment late Thursday.  Separately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has drafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday or Saturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity to finance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts, aides in his office said. Moreover, Keeley's plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who use the least amount of power. Details of the plan are still sketchy, aides said.  Possible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For State  The 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billion annually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected to generate $2.5 billion. However, it is still unclear if that is enough, the commissioners said.  Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissioners said. Since January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricity on behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric.  The state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, which must be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power.  In addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensure there is
