I think this is ignoring the facts surrounding comparative advantage and not letting resources sit idle. 

Agricultural land is a valuable asset and will not generally be let sit fallow if you don't have protectionism. It will generally prompt farmers in western countries to specialize into areas where they have the greatest level of comparative advantage (likely in crops that are suitable for high capital, low labour production), but there's no sense in leaving millions of acres fallow.   Nobody would have incentive to do that in a free market economy. 

To your example of war, I think it's not very appropriate, in that basically no wealthy country could maintain its internal economy today without international trade.  There's no way Belgium or Luxembourg could possibly feed themselves for instance. And tying huge portions of your economy to the preparation for a pan-european war is silly. In NY that would require the defendant knew or reasonably should have known the person was an officer. I imagine it's similar in NJ, since usually it's a felony enhancement, which would be very strange not to have a scienter requirement for. That has a good chance of backfiring and causing the kid to hire counsel to fight the whole thing. Plus the way you phrased it made it appear that such a charge could actually succeed, which is needlessly scary to OP. I said succeed, not be forthcoming. You can't just say that someone might get charged with a crime of which they're not guilty without pointing out that they're not in fact guilty, at least based on the disclosed facts. It's bad advice that's needlessly scary. 

And of course I can't guarantee that OP's brother wouldn't be charged with assaulting an officer. But if the facts given are True, it does not sound like he's guilty of that crime. There are three big reasons for Greece not to leave the EUR that I can see.

* **Banking crisis**

If it looks like Greece is going to leave the Euro, everyone in Greece will try to move as much of their money outside of Greek banks as possible.  This happened when Tsipras called the referrendum a few months ago.  Enormous amounts of capital flowed out of Greece for safer harbours.  That will happen again.

The only way to avoid that is to do it completely by surprise, which will mean an extremely messy rollout and a totally undemocratic process.  If Parliament has to debate the measure, that WILL cause a crisis.  

* **Massive inflation**

Yes, I agree Greece needs some inflation.  But a hastily installed New Drachma will give far more inflation than needed.  The Greek government will be totally unable to peg the Drachma to any reputable currency, and the fact of how many drachmas the government will need to print to cover its debt guarantees that it will cause a massive inflation.

As well given the immense anti-austerity sentiment in Greece, plus the huge drachma-denominated increase in anything imported, the Greek government will immediately start running enormous deficits.  This will require either borrowing at onerous interest rates, or printing money directly into the treasury.  The latter would be my guess, and it's a recipe for persistent high inflation for years to come.

* **Political repercussions**

Assuming Greece repudiates its debt (and redenomination is repudiation), there will be massive political fallout.  There is a decent probability that Greece will be involuntarily removed from a number of institutions of the Eurozone.  The most dangerous for this would be removal from the Schengen Area (the free travel zone).  If this happened, that would be a body blow to Greek tourism, as well as a massive loss of liberty of travel for Greek citizens.  &gt;Sure, the rollout is probably going to be pretty messy. But couldn't you alleviate the situation by putting controls on banking, such as banking holidays so that people couldn't move their assets overseas while the new currency is implemented?

That policy is incredibly costly.  It essentially shuts down the formal economy for the entirety of the banking holiday, forcing people to make informal arrangements to buy things such as food, medicine, gasoline, etc.  Greece just did a 2 week banking holiday related to the referendum.  It was a nightmare, with the lives of ordinary Greeks massively disrupted, and probably several percent knocked off Greece's GDP.  A long bank holiday will kill business in your country, and possibly kill people too.

Also, a short bank holiday doesn't buy you much.  Properly implementing a new currency takes *years.*  If you try to condense that to two weeks, it will be a disaster.  A few things that will go wrong:

* Payments systems will completely malfunction.  The entire Greek banking system is integrated with the ECB's computer systems for money management.  Pulling out of that unilaterally and quickly is almost impossible.  The Bank of Greece does not have an independent accounting and payments system in place.  Plus you need to deal with all the transactions pending and automatically drafted during the holiday.  And you need to loop in credit card processors, ATM network operators, etc.

* No cash.  You cannot design and print enough cash in 2 weeks for a country.  You *especially* cannot do so for high-security bills of the type that most western countries demand to prevent counterfeiting.  The Greek government will likely end up producing not enough and easily counterfeit banknotes.

* Legal chaos.  There are an enormous number of contracts which are specifically denominated in Euros.  Mortgages, credit cards, invoices, quotations, really everything.  Redenomination will make all those contracts ambiguous, with the potential that the lenders will be paid back in Drachma, not Euros.  Redenominating all private debt will completely ostracise the Greek legal system from the world, resulting in Greek businesses being unable to make contracts under Greek law, and a wholesale seizure of Greek assets overseas.  Not redenominating will mean a massive debt deflation as Greek individuals and businesses owe in Euros and are paid in worthless Drachma.

&gt;Even though it might help some sectors, inflation is going to be tough I agree. But the alternative, when things get real bad, is seeing wage cuts, massive layoffs and unemployments, benefits cut dramatically, etc. Obviously inflation is just a cover because real wages and benefits will basically still be cut by inflation. But inflation will be more accepted by people than just an outright cut in nominal wages/benefits/etc. Isn't it a better idea to chose the more politically acceptable course of action so there's less turmoil/protests/disruption? Also the Greek government probably would not want to peg the drachma to a currency. Currency controls that way overvalue a currency usually lead to disaster, so by letting the drachma devalue after it's initial introduction there won't be huge issues (well there will be, jut not because the gov is spending so much trying to keep the exchange rate up).

My two central points here are that there will be much more inflation than you think, and much more turmoil than you think.  The Drachma will probably immediately see a haircut of like 50-300% on the EUR, followed by ongoing inflation of likely over 25% a year for the first few years.  We're talking total disaster levels of inflation.  

A little inflation is tolerable and a good thing, but I am saying that because the Greek government has absolutely nothing with which it can back up its currency, and will likely have to resort to printing into the treasury due to being unable to borrow, it will have way, way too much inflation.

As to the turmoil and chaos, the stuff I said about what happens when you do a quick bank holiday and try a new currency above are pretty chaotic sounding to me, and given that Greece literally just went though a punishing banking crisis, we know that another one is likely to be similarly bad.

It is the question of whether the course of action undertaken was so deviating from what we morally expect from people that it should be criminally punished.

The alternative to an act of killing being self defense is that act being murder or manslaughter.

While it may not always be the best course of action overall, using deadly force in self defense is not something we generally consider so morally bad as to be worthy of locking you in prison for years.Sorry SirThrocken, your comment has been removed:

In order to pass a bill, you need to get a majority of the legislature on your side, and everyone's votes are public.  As such, it makes sense to form coalitions of people who have similar legislative goals and who agree to work together to pass bills.  These coalitions naturally become parties.

You can't ban people from forming parties, since it's just an agreement to work together and call yourselves by a certain name.  If you tried to ban parties, you'd fail.  If you did manage somehow to ban parties, they'd instantly re-emerge under another name "political clubs" or something.

If you banned all political associations whatsoever, you would have a totalitarian dictatorship.  That's why "one party state" is often used as a synonym with a totalitarian or unfree country.  I'll take parties over that.&gt; Or delete this post and make a new one with a more specific claim.


We strongly discourage this sort of behavior.  Do not do this.It's actually not clear that a 100% tax on income would be constitutional.  That amounts more to a taking than an income tax, and would potentially trigger the takings clause of the 5th amendment, which prohibits taking private property for public use without just compensation.

1.  The government shouldn't charge for access to faster lanes, because it is public infrastructure.

2.  The government shouldn't contract out toll collection by giving a large chunk of the money to the contractor.

Do you agree that these are totally separate issues?  That is, you could have situation 1 with a wholly government run HOT lane, or you could have situation 2 with something where charging money is appropriate (e.g. municipal owned parking lots).Can you explain why you think the sum is greater than the parts?  What is the interrelationship of the two things which creates extra badness.  Because I see them as more or less totally separable, and would like to argue them separately.Wait, are you conceding it or not conceding it?  Because you say you're conceding it, but then make a counterpoint.I'm removing this for the moment because it's a repost of a CMV you put up earlier.

So that might not work.&gt;I believe this is the root of many of our political problems, and that it at least contributes to an ineffective Congress, party-line voting, and refusal to take rational positions in office.

I don't think your diagnosis of the cause of these problems is accurate.

First, as far as the effectiveness of Congress, the pressure to do things like shutdowns is not coming from big money donors, especially those representing corporate interests.  Big money donors hate this kind of crap.

The pressure is coming from primary challengers, often with little money, who rage against the machine.  See, for instance the college professor who unseated Eric Cantor (House majority leader) in a primary with no kind of money.

The problem for the effectiveness of Congress comes from the fact of hyper-partisan districts meaning primaries become the only meaningful elections, combined with the fact that the US doesn't have a system for loss of confidence in the same manner that parliamentary democracies do.

As to party line voting, that is something that happens in basically every legislature.  It is also becoming *less* common, as can be seen by John Boehner's inability to wrangle his caucus.  This largely has to do with the abolition of earmarks, which removed the ability of leadership to promise pork barrel projects in exchange for votes.

Refusal to take rational positions in office is way too vague and mostly boils down to "I disagree with their positions." So I don't think you can really attribute that to anything other than disagreeing.I don't think you can both say that party line voting and bipartisan support of industry are ascendant.  They're mutually exclusive phenomena.  Either we're getting more partisan splits on these sort of bills (implying there is less gridlock) or we're getting less (implying there's less party-line voting).

And while corporate donors do try to lobby for favored regulations, that's not a uniquely American phenomenon.  Industry-friendly laws get passed all the time in countries with much stricter campaign finance laws than the US.  Generally politicians want to curry favor with businesses who employ lots of people in their districts, and want to get more employment in their districts.

I don't think the level of donations we have going on now is particularly great, but you're treating campaign finance change as if it's a cure all.  There are much deeper structural questions in the American political system relating to separation of powers, multiple gatekeepers on legislation, gerrymandering, federalism, and genuine geographic political polarization which explain far more about the problems of governance in America than campaign laws.

So yes, reform campaign finance laws, but it won't do nearly as much as you think.  Corporations will still spend money on lobbying, will still supply members of Congress with talking points and draft bills.  Parties will still exist and be partisan because they want to be elected and need to distinguish themselves.  Backbenchers will still get whipped with threats from leadership. Politicians will still fear intra-party challenges, and be able to use our Constitutional system to foster gridlock when it suits their political interests.

I want to push back on this point.  US law specifically prohibits Snowden from making this defense.  The programs being illegal is not a defense under the law to an espionage charge.  If Snowden or his lawyers tried to make that case to the jury, they would be prevented from doing so.

I want to be clear how far this would extend.  If Snowden's attorneys tried to do this, the government would raise an objection, and the court would order them to stop.  If they persisted, the jury would be removed from the room, and the judge would likely sanction his attorneys, up to and including by disbarring them.

If Snowden tried to do this personally, it would differ in that instead of being disbarred, Snowden would be removed from the courtroom, and placed in a separate room by video feed.  If he tried to make prohibited arguments about the programs legality, his mic and video would be cut off.

The law provides zero protection for whistleblowers in cases like this.It was deleted for violating Rule 1, which requires that top level comments challenge some aspect of the OP's view.  We do that to prevent posts from just becoming "reinforce my view."Why couldn't you have brought up these points in the top level reply? I know you know the rules better than that.I actually have found Canadian Tire furniture to be both bad and expensive.  My b/f and I were looking the other day for an end table, and they had cheap veneered pressboard ones starting at like $100.It depends.  For a set of solid-wood chairs?  You'll still save money.  The difference is that there are now widely available chairs made of cheaper materials (such as steel tubing) which undercut you.

That's a good thing for consumers overall.  It adds another option for those on a budget, while those who want chairs made of higher quality material can still get them.IKEA is not the pinnacle of expensive high-quality manufacturing.  The person you're responding to was saying that if you were to go buy the best beds on the market today, they'll be even better than your bed.

For instance, [here is a nice looking hand-carved four poster bed](https://www.restorationhardware.com/catalog/product/product.jsp?productId=prod690079&amp;categoryId=cat1600008) available today.  You can get it in exactly the size you want, upholstered how you want, finished how you want.  You can also get 100 similar beds depending on your taste and design choice.  

The menu of choices alone today to let someone get exactly the bed they want is a huge quality improvement.Hand-carved beds from 100 years ago are probably worse than ones today.

First, they're probably not going to have joints which are as accurately made, because machines are simply better at doing precise cuts.  Old beds tend to creak in ways new ones don't because of this.

Second, they'll have way, *way* more options than old beds did.  You can get a bed with a lower profile today because it's better engineered, whereas in the past, you'd have needed thick visible beams to support it.  You can get the same quality bed lighter, and/or able to be disassembled.  The latter is particularly nice if you want to get the bed into a tricky room, or want to move ever.

You can also have the bed made with the wood you want, to the size you want, and with a bunch of other choices, without losing any structural integrity or adding outrageous extra cost.You probably could undercut the Walmart table and chairs if you had the equipment.  It's not as common of stuff to have in a home shop as a table saw (plus you still need the table saw) but not 100% impossible.

I will push back on the premade meals thing a bit.  That might be True if you're very bad at cooking, or maybe if you're cooking for one.  But if you're feeding a family, you generally do *far* better by shopping for groceries and cooking yourself.

I'm all for capitalist innovation, but I recognize that it hasn't yet made cooking obsolete. Especially because if you're good at it, the quality/price package you get from cooking yourself vastly exceeds the package you get from buying premade foods.I think you're overlooking a much  more dangerous possibility: Turkey invoking NATO to force us to fight Kurdistan.  If Kurdish forces invade Turkey (or Turkey runs a False flag op to make it appear so), Turkey can invoke Article 5 of NATO to force the US and European allies to go to war with Kurdistan.  We would either have to fight them, kick Turkey out of NATO, or dissolve NATO.

Option 1 is defeating to the goal you have here.

Option 2 is a disaster to US strategic interests, considering how much of our middle eastern operations depend on Turkish bases.

Option 3 is a worst case scenario for what happens when NATO doesn't actually defend a member state against invasion - everyone seeing the alliance as not True mutual defense, but just a fair weather friendship.Can you clarify what you said then?  I didn't intend to overstate it.  I thought you were saying that in a substantial percent if not majority of cases, premade meals could undercut home cooking for the same meal.  Is that not accurate?I think you're sidestepping a bit here by talking about a potential advantage without directly engaging the disadvantages I'm highlighting.

Even without an invasion or False flag, what if this prompts Turkey to leave NATO?  Wouldn't that be much more of a disaster for us than the benefit that comes from carving out Kurdistan?At a minimum, that would cause Turkey to withdraw ALL support from US airstrikes emanating from Turkish bases, as well as potentially sealing their border to refugees, prompting mass death.  It  would also put the US government on the Shia Iraqi government's shit list.  That would mean basically cutting off our two biggest allies for fighting ISIS.  If the US wanted to persist in its ISIS containment policy, it would mean flying in from Greece over Lebanon.

Likely as well it would embolden ISIS to go after the now weakened Iraqi government and make gains in that area.

This strategy will end up weakening the US, weakening the Iraqi government, strengthening ISIS, and fracturing the area even more than it is already.  The US needs to build support from as many groups as it can.  Everyone hates the Kurds.  Picking them to support means everyone else we need would turn on us.You mean after the persistent Sunni guerrillas who have been fighting since shortly after the fall of Saddam and whom a wholesale US occupation for 7 years couldn't fully suppress are defeated?

Yeah, get back to me when that happens.I have never been to Tokyo and can't speak to it (and I know food prices in Japan are weird and high).  I can speak to NY though, and I think a burrito is cheaper made at home unless there's just one of you.  And that is almost entirely due to the fact that you can't buy like 2.5 ounces of steak, or 1.5 ounces of avocado.I don't think a theoretical discussion is terribly useful is all.  

As to that specific hypothetical though, trying to carve out such a region is likely to reignite conflict.  It means that sectarian carveouts are now on the table.  And the areas of Sunni militancy you just suppressed are going to be re-emboldened to demand just such a carveout for themselves.  And if you don't give it to them, ISIS might come back under a new banner.I wasn't clear.  You're saying ISIS in NW Iraq/W Syria gets suppressed, and shortly after that we give Kurds some sort of autonomous region in N. Syria.  My point is that the Sunni elements in NW Iraq and W Syria are going to then say "hey, we want the same deal you just gave the Kurds."  And if/when you don't give it to them, they'll restart ISIS under a new name.  If you do give it to them.  It will just be ISIS under a new name.

If we don't do anything for the Kurds, they'll fight for themselves still.  Maybe carve out some turf by force.  Likely using their area of effective control in Northern Iraq as a base from which to expand.  But because we didn't hand it to them, we aren't tied to the means by which they get it.To be clear, who exactly is winning the Syrian civil war here?  Assad?  The Free Syrian Army?  ISIS?And in what universe is Assad going to agree to this?  Assad is not an ally of the US and we can't tell him what to do. 

Also, you're saying the US shouldn't screw over the people who supported us.  Unfortunately that's not possible.  Not screwing the Kurds screws the Iraqis and Turks.  In a realpolitik standpoint, we need the Turks and Iraqis far more than we need the Kurds.

The best we can do is let the Kurds fend for themselves and hopefully they'll be able to forcibly stop anyone else from rolling over them.  Sorry hortonhoo, your submission has been removed:

I didn't have strong opinions on North Korean history before that, and was pretty well convinced they were communist, so not exactly what a delta is for, but still wanted to say thanks.

Do you have any particular expertise on the matter if I may ask?  You seem quite familiar with the history.If you're going to reuse the same ingredients in different dishes, you can usually get around the "unless there's only one of you" factor.  But it becomes more of a pain in the butt.  Plus fresh ingredients only last so long.  If you buy a 10-pack of large tortillas, you might not have that many burritos or quesadillas before they go bad.

Moreover, it requires more up front spending.  Let's say I have $10 in my pocket and no ingredients.  I can't buy burrito ingredients at the grocery store because they'll cost more like $15.  They'll make more than 1 burrito, but that doesn't help me too much as I'm severely budget constrained in this moment.  But I can buy a burrito from a shop for under $10.  So I may end up getting a $10 burrito from a truck or something.

But if there are two of us and we have $20 together, we can buy burrito ingredients from the store, have 2 burritos, and pocket the $5.&gt; I am employed by a company. All of the ideas, designs, patents and work produced while employed by the company belong to the said company.

This isn't necessarily the case by default.  It is the case because your contract with the company says so.  Couples hiring a wedding photographer are free to sign a contract saying whatever they and the photographer agree on.

Perhaps the photographer would offer them a 5% discount for retaining copyright to use in their portfolio, and the couple, not caring about copyright, accepts that deal.  Why shouldn't such deals be allowed?

*edit: typo*Why is it crazy that owning more rights costs more than owning less?  Copyright is a property interest.  If you want more property, you need to pay more money.  

All I did in my first post was frame it as a discount rather than a surcharge.  But $500 discounted to $400 if you give up rights is not at all different from $400 with a $100 surcharge to own the rights.&gt;When I call a plumber to replace a pipe, he doesn't tell me that he owns the pipe and I get to use it for personal use, but if I sell my house, he gets to sell the pipe separately.

This sort of thing is a deal which happens though.  Not usually with pipe, but with heavy equipment lease arrangements are quite common.  It is again whatever the contracting parties agree on.&gt;I do want to be that change - but I am running into a wall and everyone looks at me sideways - how dare I suggest to take something away from "the artist"

It's not a question of "how dare you take something away from the artist" but that you're asking for something more valuable and don't want to pay more money.  Most couples don't care about the copyright, and as such the "standard" deal is to get a lower price and no copyright.

If you want to negotiate a different deal, you're free to do so, but "I want more ownership but don't want to pay more money" is not a deal most people will accept.  It's like going to a restaurant and asking for the recipe to be bundled in with the price of the entree.  You could ask for the recipe, but don't be surprised when they direct you to the $30 cookbook on sale at the hostess desk.&gt;Why do commercial rights cost more, they are the same pictures, and the guy wouldn't have them to sell if I didn't pay him to take them to begin with.

Right now, you're paying the photographer in a combination of money and right to use this in their portfolio.  Both of those are valuable to the photographer.  If you want to remove the latter compensation, the photographer will likely demand more money.&gt;Because what you are doing is diving the piece of pie into more pieces, and charging more for it.

&gt;Saying there are publishing rights, printing rights, commercial rights, viewing rights, etc. All you are doing is coming up with more rights, so you can sell them back to me.

These are the rights that exist under the law.  They are not exclusive to wedding photos and extend to all areas of copyright law.  The wedding photographer didn't invent them.

You absolutely can sign a contract that extends to all aspects of the copyright and all intellectual property rights whatsoever.  It's quite easy to draft and I'm sure you can find a template on the internet.  But the other side will want more money for signing that.

&gt;The example I gave earlier, I pay you to paint a portrait of me. When you are done, I get to keep the portrait I have the rights over it, because I paid you to do it, and you agreed to sell your skills and time and do that for me, in exchange for the money.

Again, depending on the contract.  I might agree to do the portrait for less if I were allowed to show a reproduction of it in my portfolio.You just have unusual preferences.  It's fine to have unusual preferences, but don't be surprised when defaults aren't set up for them.  Most people just want some nice photos they can put in an album, hang on the wall, and share on Facebook.  They don't care that the photographer will use them for advertising.

As such, the default deal caters to them, with lower prices and the photographer keeping rights.

That norm isn't irrational though.  It doesn't really impact me if my wedding photos are used for the photographer's marketing.  It's not being "sheep," it's a potentially rational balancing of money and property ownership.

Some people have reason to care.  If I was a famous person for instance, I might not want my image used to bolster someone's career whom I really don't want to endorse forever.  Or maybe I want to use them for some weird commercial purpose, or want to remain hyper-anonymous.  In those cases, I can make a custom deal.It's not taking you for a fool or double dipping.  It's just a negotiation.  The right to use your pictures in their portfolio is legitimately very valuable to a photographer.  If you want them to not have that right, you need to pay them a substantial amount of extra money above what you would if you gave them that right.

If you just want to be able to edit them, or have raw originals, that probably shouldn't cost you too much.  Tax avoidance sometimes results in companies taking undue risks.  For instance, [a leveraged buyout was recently used to allow Dell to repatriate a lot of overseas income](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/02/dell_goes_private_leveraged_buyout_will_help_dell_pay_investors_while_minimizing.html) and pay it out as interest (a business expense) as opposed to dividends (subject to 35% corporate income tax).

However, the deal required loading up Dell on debt.  If future revenue streams don't meet expectations, it could force Dell into bankruptcy, even if Dell would have been fine without doing the leveraged buyout.

Taking long term risks just to (legally) dodge taxes isn't very good behavior in my books.I work in law.  Apart from law, my formal background is in philosophy and economics.

I am aware of taking strategic risks.  It isn't inherently bad, but I think the way many public companies are currently governed creates extreme near-term bias which prompts companies to make bad long-term decisions, including decisions such as these.

Avoidance activity is generally defined as activity you would not undertake but for the tax advantage.  Sometimes that will be sensible if the tax advantage is very large.  But sometimes it will not be.  The Dell case is one where I think the deal substantially hurt the firm's long term prospects for a one-time gain, and did so in a way that helped largely institutional investors who could dump their shares into the buyback without getting front-run like they normally do, as opposed to investors seeking long term value from an ongoing firm.

For more on near-term bias and malinvestment, I'd suggest [this piece.](http://www.expectationsinvesting.com/TCO/EconomicsofShortTerm.pdf)&gt;Disagree, are you saying people are only having kids for a tax break? or buying homes for that reason?

No, I am saying that they're not engaged in tax avoidance, unless they wouldn't have done those without the tax break.  Putting money into an IRA?  That's tax avoidance.  Tax avoidance != tax breaks.

Some people will do those things for the tax break.  The first time homebuyer credit, the property tax deduction and the mortgage interest deduction might make buying a home more affordable than renting for many people, whereas they'd otherwise rent.  In those cases, it's avoidance.  If they would have bought the house anyway, then it's just a tax break.

&gt;But in terms of talking about tax avoidance, my stand is that its okay to do so, it is legal after all.

In another comment, you said that you wanted to be convinced that it was morally bad (at least sometimes) even if it was legal.

Here, you're implying that it's moral to do whatever's legal.

Do you believe someone can undertake an action that is both legal and immoral?

&gt;But might not be the best decision, thats another topic.

If you ascribe to a utilitarian moral philosophy, not making the best decision is immoral.I think my definition jibes very well with yours.  If you would have done the thing anyway, it does not modify your situation in any way, and isn't avoidance.

Avoidance isn't when you file for a deduction, it's when you do a thing in the real world so that you qualify to file for that deduction.They often run worse.  For instance, a GPS app optimized for older phones would have put the text in large letters because the screen resolution was quite poor.  Optimizing for newer phones will have smaller text because the resolution is high enough for it to be just as legible.

As well, they may load more map around you (great for if your signal is spotty, but makes lower-memory phones crash), may calculate alternate routes on the fly before they're needed (very useful, but again a memory hog) or default to satellite imagery instead of a vanilla map.It also depends how long you want it to last.  A 100 pound phone today will work fine, but probably be slow as crap in 2 years when GPS apps have gotten even MORE memory heavy (to show you where the gas stations along your route are, and keep your friends informed of where you are, or whatever other features they add).

Separate issue is one of batteries.  Batteries tend to degrade over time, and so an older phone will probably have lost some of its ability to hold a charge.  That's an annoyance.

Of course it isn't totally necessary to get a new phone.  And if that's your standard for "a waste of money" I can't change that.  But it has some perks, including the phone tending to last longer both from being able to stay on the cutting edge, and from hardware not degrading.&gt;The biggest problem I have with that idea is that it's pretty hard (though not technically impossible) to ban someone only from posting, but not from commenting...

I think this might actually be possible.  I know there's an approved submitter list which lets people post in lieu of whatever filters we have.  I think there might be an inverse to that list.&gt;In reality the battery issue is important however phones comfortably go from morning to evening comfortably. 

Depends who you are.  A lot of power users constantly need to charge their phones.  One of my friends was on his phone so much that it very consistently died while we were out and about.  He recently upgraded to a late model phone specifically because it had the battery life he wanted.That's a good example and I guess I'll award a technical !delta since it is a circumstance where you are cosigning, even though you're actually just paying for the car. 

Though I don't know if the interest on a car loan is really worth the credit score boost. Even with a cosigner, you're probably paying hundreds of dollars a year in unnecessary interest. So I wouldn't do that particular scheme. Apart from the first bullet, aren't all of those accomplished by lending them the money directly, rather than cosigning?

I would prefer to do what was suggested in the article and give them $500 to open a secured credit card, if they very much need to build credit.Sorry nicka_please, your comment has been removed:

If I were a landlord, based on these facts, I wouldn't rent to you without a cosigner or substantial prepayment.

You have had emergencies for which you didn't have the savings and are now in maxed out credit card debt.  Such emergencies are likely to happen in the future, and if you can't put them on a card, you're likely to face a choice of paying the rent and dealing with them.

You also have student loans in forbearance.  From the sound of it, a lot of them.  That can't continue forever, and as a prospective landlord, I would presume that at some point, you'd need to start making payments on them.  Given what appears to be a low income, it may not be possible to both do that and pay the rent.

Even if you decided to pay the rent over your student loans, there is a very real risk that your wages would be garnished or bank accounts levied by the lender once they weren't in forbearance.  You might not have a choice about it.

Last, paying rent to your dad isn't the same as paying to a faceless landlord.  You don't have an emotional investment in paying a landlord back in the same way you do a parent.  So I wouldn't count paying rent to your dad to the same degree I would paying to an independent landlord.

I want to point out that I don't mean this to be anything bad about you as a person.  Being in a tough financial spot isn't a moral failing.  It doesn't imply you did any bad act, or that you aren't deserving.  It is simply cold calculus about what the probability of you paying a given bill or debt is.I see it as a much worse idea than giving them the money.  It can ruin your credit as the cosigner, cause you to pay exhorbitant interest and fees, and is likely to ruin relationships in a way a straightforward gift isn't.

If you're prepared to take responsibility for it, then take responsibility at the start and give them the money.Why wouldn't I just lend that person the money directly then?  That way I control the interest and repayment terms, and can't have it mess up my credit if they fail to pay.In that case, why not lend the money to them directly?  Then you get the payments they make, you (not the bank) keep the interest, there are no fees, it can't wreck your credit, etc.

What's the advantage of cosigning over that?You, as the cosigner, cannot sell the asset without the consent of the borrower until and unless the lender forecloses/repossesses.

If I cosign my cousin's car loan, and he doesn't pay, I can't sell the car.  He can get as many months behind as it takes for the lender to repo it.  And if they do repo it, they're going to sell it at auction and come after me for the difference.  

Plus I'll have a bunch of missed payments and a repo on my credit, which is very bad for me.If you are a cosigner, there is always a risk to your credit.  If the primary borrower is late on a payment, *you* have a late payment on your credit.  If they default, *you* have a default on your credit.

A default and payoff in full is a negative mark on your credit.  Plus it usually comes with ripoff interest rates and fees.

You also have to trust the borrower not to destroy the value of the asset.  For instance, if you cosign a car loan for someone who drives 40k miles a year, that's more or less an unsecured loan, because that car's value is going to drop like a rock.

Also, they don't *have* to repo the car.  They can just decide it's too hard and you're rich, and just go after you before going after the car.

But I would definitely not be comfortable cosigning a loan I couldn't comfortably afford to pay off in full, because if and when it comes due, it's likely to come due with little notice and all at once.Who buys an 18 year old a brand new car?  I mean, I guess you can do that, but that seems incredibly expensive and foolish to me.Just a heads up, while linking to or reposting an argument isn't against our rules, we do ask that you add some commentary of your own per rule 5 against low-effort comments.

Not the specific LBO technique that Dell used (which is more aggressive), but Apple is loading up on huge amounts of debt in an avoidance scheme to repatriate foreign earnings in avoidance of US taxes.

They have, according to that piece from last month, *$55 billion* in bonds outstanding, all of which are related to tax avoidance schemes.You're not really factoring in price.  This is like saying "a brand new Mercedes-Benz SUV is the best car for college students," and then listing all the nice features it has.

Yes, it is a very good laptop.  But most college students can't afford it.  Most college students do not have $1500-2000 to be spending on a laptop.  

All of the features you listed are not critical to the task of being a college student.  They're just convenient things to have.  Having conveniences is nice, but needs to be weighed against cost.  Is it really worth $500+ extra on a computer to shave 1 pound off your backpack weight?There exist windows laptops with comparable battery life and weight to the MacBook Pro.

I had considered the MBP to be probably the best choice though with an unjustifiable price.  But that plus the keyboard issue make me think it's not a good laptop on the merits.  I shall give you a !delta.I was just taking it from what you said.  You said the student loans were in forbearance because you weren't making enough money.

In any case, I don't want this to be me beating up on you, and I don't want you to feel like you need to justify yourself.  But so far I don't think you have convinced me more broadly that banks are making poor risk assessments in lending when they demand cosigners.
Chromebooks are probably a little too low-end for a college student most likely.

* **Labour:**  We operate a whole second solid waste disposal system specifically for recyclables.  That's tens of thousands of people who could potentially be doing more productive work.

* **Capital:**   The second solid waste system is also very capital intensive, with land and machinery being used for sorting and warehousing of the recyclable waste.

* **Hassle:**  Something being a hassle is a negative.  It's not the world's biggest negative, but it's not nothing.  All else being equal, I'd be anti-hassle.

Also, there's good evidence that [recycling businesses aren't sustainably scalable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/american-recycling-is-stalling-and-the-big-blue-bin-is-one-reason-why/2015/06/20/914735e4-1610-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html?hpid=z3)  One substantial issue is recycling glass, which is basically just stupid.  It made sense when bottles were so hard to manufacture that they were reused.  But the raw material for glass (sand) is not at all scarce, and recycled glass bottles are basically just fragile rocks that clog up recycling plants.

I'm basically with OP here.  Some recycling (aluminum) is quite valuable, some (paper) is marginally valuable, and some (glass) is just stupid.  But none of it makes an enormous environmental impact.Sorry mfalfire, your submission has been removed:

It's a website for a lobby organization, and no citations are given for any of the numbers.  They also keep using different years, which indicates potential cherry picking.

It also tries to say that the costs are benefits, pointing to the "1.1 million" people working in the industry.  That it takes the labour of 1.1 million people to get these benefits is a cost.  We need to compare it to a world in which those people were doing some other job.Well, got some hard facts for me?  I'm open to changing my view here, but I do have a bit of a predisposition that things getting large government subsidies are likely wasteful of useful resources.

It also seems like a hard facts approach might work better with OP.There are lots of low to medium skill jobs in the economy that are valuable.  If your proposal is that we should have persistent make-work programs and consider that a benefit, I think you're going to have a tough time convincing many economists that's a good idea.&gt;If recycling is revenue neutral

It's a bit cyclical, but right now [almost all recycling programs in the US require substantial government subsidies.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/american-recycling-is-stalling-and-the-big-blue-bin-is-one-reason-why/2015/06/20/914735e4-1610-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html?hpid=z3)

In general it seems that the programs are not very scalable, and that attempts to increase recycling past the most obviously profitable items (aluminum cans) have backfired.&gt;The money saved by recycling is very dependent upon the price of oil. This applies both directly to the petroleum used in plastics and indirectly in all industries to manufacturing costs.

True, but we can use longer term averages, and/or recognize that it is a tradeoff regarding other energy uses.

&gt;When you talk about "costs" what do you include? Just the actual recycling? The collection process? The time spent by consumers?

All of the above.  The costs are the opportunity costs of all of the land labour and capital being used on recycling versus some other thing(s).

&gt;When you talk about benefits, how much is a decrease in CO2 emissions worth?

Hard to say, but I'd apply the same number to the overall economy.  My personal preference would just be to apply a direct per-ton tax on CO2 emissions and let recycling happen on a free market basis thereafter.  If it really saves so much emissions, it should have a big competitive edge.  Aluminum cans will almost certainly still be profitable for instance.

&gt;Saving 100 trees?

We're talking paper here?  That means these are trees farmed on tree farms.  The benefit of this is approximately equal to the cost of farming the trees, including the labour involved, and an amortized cost on the land.

&gt;Decreased landfill size?

Cost of building and maintaining the extra landfill, including any externalities imposed on neighbors.

&gt;Metal recycling is pretty much always a win because metals can be reused with no decrease in quality (unlike plastics and paper) and are expensive to mine

I'll give you this for most metals.

&gt;Single stream recycling requires a significant investment, but ends up saving time for consumers and increasing recycling rates

I won't give you this as a benefit unless you can show that the higher recycling rates are overall a benefit.  Is the additional material into the recycling stream of a net marginal benefit?  Or is it just cluttering the stream with low/negative value crap?

That is, what's the marginal utility of increased material in the recycling stream?

&gt;Unless you assign benefit to the environment, there's no clear consensus on the overall benefit of recycling.

I assign some value to this.  That's why I support taxing pollutants at a rate approximately equal to the demonstrable marginal harm they do, a pigouvian tax.What taxes do you want to raise to compensate for the lost revenue from property taxes?Property taxes are assessed at the state and local levels.  According to [Census data](http://www2.census.gov/govs/qtax/2015/q2t1.xls) (warning: spreadsheet), property taxes accounted for ~39%^1 of all state and local tax revenue for the 12 months ending in June 2015.

So where will the money come from?  California implemented a high "millionaires tax" on incomes over 1 million back in the mid-2000s.  [It raised total state tax revenue by about 1%.](https://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/working_papers/Varner-Young_Millionaire_Migration_in_CA.pdf)

I don't think you're going to get much from corporate income taxes.  Even a very substantial overall hike will get you only a little more revenue, since they produce so little as it stands.  Call it another 1% increase in revenue.

For capital gains, tax revenues can be hyper-variable depending on market conditions.  But even the Federal cap gains tax [produces far less revenue than you'd hope for](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=161) around 3-10%^2 of total state and local revenue if it were entirely devoted to state and local governments.  For hiking it at the state level, I'll say you're lucky and can add another 1% on average to the state budget.

So we've gotten 3% of the 39% replaced by doing the realistic maxing out of capital gains tax, corporate tax, and income tax on very high incomes.

The rest needs to come from sales taxes.  And sales taxes are [very regressive,](http://www.citylab.com/work/2015/01/how-local-sales-taxes-target-the-poor-and-widen-the-income-gap/384643/) as well as being a body blow to local businesses who see their prices suddenly become a lot less affordable.  To pay for a 50% reduction in avg property taxes, you'd be looking at sales taxes about 65-70% higher than they are now.  That's a huge tax hike which will kick the poor and middle class in the teeth.

On the Republican side, Marco Rubio is on the Senate foreign relations committee.  On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton was the secretary of state.  

Also our foreign policy is doing pretty well right now.  We have managed to make a big deal with Iran, as well as keeping Russia pretty contained and marginalized.  We also just signed a big trade deal with a bunch of allies in the Pacific rim designed to isolate China.

You may think we shouldn't be doing some of these things, but the US is being very effective lately at carrying out foreign policy.  If you want to change foreign policy, you should pick someone good at it who wants to make changes, not someone bad at it.Sorry starfirex, your comment has been removed:

The cost of the UBI would be roughly on par with the *entire* Federal budget.  It's an incredibly expensive program.  Generally HGV drivers are pretty good diesel mechanics, and with all these trucks rolling around driverless, they'll need to be maintained to *much* higher standards (a breakdown is much more of a disaster for a driverless truck).  So a lot of them might transition to repair and maintenance work on the same or similar trucks they used to drive.  Repair and maintenance is inherently hard to automate as well, because diagnosing the root cause of a fault is a creative act that requires the sort of observation that can't be done automatically.

HGV drivers also do a lot of logistics work at the destination, unloading and such.  Those jobs won't go away.  Driverless trucks will mean more workers are needed at warehouses and stores to load and unload trucks.Snowden did not commit treason.  He did not commit "high treason" which isn't even a thing under US law (we only have one kind of treason).

Snowden has not been charged with treason.  If charged, he would never be able to be convicted.

Treason requires that you levy war against the United States, or declare allegiance to and provide material aid and comfort to the wartime enemies of the United States.  The act of treason is the only crime defined in the Constitution.  And the reason it's there is specifically to avoid the problem of people doing things the government disagrees with or dislikes being called traitors under the law.This is factually incorrect.  The President can pardon someone in advance of any charges or trial.  Rather famously, Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon without Nixon having ever been charged with a crime.It actually isn't True though.  The President can issue pardons to someone who has never been tried, or even charged.  The most famous example of this would be Ford's pardon of Nixon.&gt;What if you get caught stealing porn or smoking pot due to illegal surveillance? You were breaking the law, but you were revealed by illegal means. Should you still be punished?

Under the laws of the United States, you should not be.  Evidence secured in violation of the law is [generally suppressed and cannot be used at trial.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_rule)  And evidence gathered by police work derived from an unlawful source [is also normally excluded.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree)

I do not believe Snowden is calling for the NSA to be legally prosecuted.  He just wants them to stop.You're assuming the number of trucks stays the same.  In this brave new world where trucking costs have fallen drastically and there are a lot more manufactured goods to be sent to people, there will be many more trucks to maintain and load/unload.

And all those warehouse drones will need to be maintained too.  Snowden committed crimes.  Leaking classified documents is against a bunch of laws.  He just didn't commit the specific crime of treason.

You omitted the first part of the element of the crime, which requires declaring allegiance to a wartime enemy of the United States.  He didn't do that.  Therefore, no treason.

Moreover, his intent in leaking was not to aid the wartime enemies of the United States, but to reveal what he believed to be illegal programs.  For treason, you have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he intended to provide aid and comfort to the enemy.

The justice system exists to try people for specific crimes when the government alleges they committed those specific crimes.  The government is not alleging that Snowden committed treason.  If he were brought to the US, this would not be tested in court because Snowden is not charged with treason.  Were he charged, it is a near certainty he would be acquitted because the facts of the case do not align to the elements of treason.I never said painlessly.  My point is that if mass automation happens how you think, it is going to produce bananas economic growth.  They might not find jobs in diesel maintenance, but there will be lots of new and different things that need doing in a world of mass automation.  And a lot of those things will be "low skill."  

You're also mistaken in assuming that the transition will happen overnight though.  The first driverless trucks will be unable to work in all conditions and will be shockingly expensive.  There will be a gradual switch-over as more capital goes into them, and the prices gradually fall while the capabilities gradually rise.

But in a world of breakneck economic growth propelled by vastly cheaper production of physical goods, there will be lots of new opportunities arising at those points in the chain which aren't easy to automate.  

For just one tiny example of things that are hard to automate: getting people to sign for stuff.  Some delivery to, and pickup from, homes and locations without shipping bays will probably still be done by human drivers who can verify that someone actually accepted the delivery, or who can ring the bell to pick up the package.&gt;Take a look at the growth we've experienced since the economic crash... where has it all gone? To everyone equally? To those who had to suffer whilst it recovered? Haha, no... It's all gone to the richest of the rich.

I would disagree with you there.  The majority of economic growth has gone to the global middle income.  The top 1% globally have also done pretty well, but roughly the 90th-99th percentile have done quite poorly, relatively speaking, largely due to the expansion of global trade to poorer countries, which are rapidly becoming less poor (read: China)

&gt;I had assumed you were arguing, essentially, that we do nothing at all and it'll work itself out. Am I mistaken?

I think it will more or less work itself out, and that the cure may be worse than the disease, with high taxes and/or strict regulations making it harder on low income workers by slowing the economy.  The UBI is better than most plans on the strict regulation front, but worse on the high taxes front.

Moreover though, I think there's inherently a contradiction in saying that the gains to all of this will go to elites, and at the same time these machines will be so prevalent as to displace all workers.

If the machines are so expensive that only well capitalized firms/investors can buy them, that means making them will be an area of *enormous* cost.  And that enormous cost will include enormous labour costs.  If it didn't, then the cost would get beaten down by the very automation you're proposing.

If the costs do get beaten down, then we'll just have crazy pants economic growth of the likes not seen since the first waves of the industrial revolution.  

&gt;I'm going to go off on a minor rhetorical tangent for a moment if you'll indulge me... think of 2005. A decade ago. What sort of phone did people have in their pockets? The iPhone 1 wasn't even out yet. It wouldn't be out for two more years. Nobody could have predicted both the size and scale of mobile technology coming nor how outrageously fast everything got miniaturised.

Yes, a lot of innovation will happen, but millions of people are now employed in phone manufacturing who weren't before.  Some of the jobs are very high skill, but many aren't, and most of the people working them came in with zero skills directly relevant to the job.

I can see an ex-truck-driver working in a phone factory.

&gt;I mean just on a basic level... telemetry... GPS, onboard camera and all of the tracking information from the drone could just be used as evidence the delivery was made.

I am sorry I wasn't clear, I was talking about things which for legal or security reasons have to be delivered not just to a location, but to a human.  For instance, if you order an Apple computer shipped to you, their corporate policy is to prohibit just leaving it at the door because if someone doesn't take delivery, it's likely to get stolen.  I work at a law firm and regularly send out and receive things for which a human must sign for legal reasons.

That might change eventually, but law generally moves much slower than technology.

Even if this is a poor example though, surely you agree there are parts of the chain which are poorly suited to automation?  I don't think landscaping jobs are likely to be automated quickly, or a lot of construction and repair jobs.

In the 2001-2006 economic expansion in the US for instance, housing construction and remodeling was a huge driver of middle income jobs for relatively low skill workers.  I could see that happening again.Sorry throwdownperu, your submission has been removed:

They compare the murder rate on highways to the total number of people travelling on highways for any reason whatsoever.

The stat you want, and which isn't really available, is (rapes and murders of hitchhikers) / (number of miles hitchhiked)  The numerator we might be able to find.  The denominator we can't because hitchhiking is an activity which is inherently not recorded or planned.Fixing the car is a far more difficult problem than driving.  In requires a lot of fuzzy observation skills for diagnosing, and a lot of fine motor skills for accessing tricky areas and working on broken or worn down parts.

I don't think your robot will be able to say stuff like "that smells like burning oil" or be able to effectively question someone about the sound the car makes when it turns left.So we're making it easiest to give for those for whom it is already the easiest?  I would think if anything you'd want to do the opposite, giving the smallest breaks to the rich and the biggest to the poor.  Right now I'll just settle for equal ones though.For many things this is right.  For repairs I think it's not terribly helpful.  If the computer can't diagnose the problem, repeating that failure will just get you the same failure again.First, I want to point out that we're not just talking about charitable deductions, we're also talking about things like saving for retirement.  In fact, retirement savings are the dominant tax deduction category, dwarfing almost all others.

&gt;You think it would make the most sense to encourage those who are least capable of giving to give more and those who are most capable of doing so to give less? Really?

I think it makes the most sense to funnel government subsidies to those who have the least income, yes.  The point of the deduction is in part to encourage the behavior, and in part to soften the blow of spending money for those who can't afford it.

&gt;I think the charitable organizations being benefited by these contributions could better judge whether they'd rather have a poor person break the bank to give them 1000 dollars or a rich person give them 5000 so they could get a sizable tax credit.

I don't think you can just ask the recipients of the money as the way to determine if it should be spent that way.  I would also like it if the government were giving my employer a 40% tax boost to be used on my pay.  That doesn't make it a good use of government funds.The Supreme Court has held that adhering to and providing aid and comfort are two separate elements.  I rephrased "adhering to" to "declaring allegiance to."  This was for clarity since the phrasing in the Constitution is a bit archaic.

See, for instance the Supreme Court's ruling in [*Kawakita v. United States,*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14270191881160802490&amp;q=treason+adhering+to&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33) 343 US 717 (1952)

&gt;So far as material here, the crime thus consists of two elements\u2014adhering to the enemy; and giving him aid and comfort. See Cramer v. United States, 325 U. S. 1, 29. One may think disloyal thoughts and have his heart on the side of the enemy. Yet if he commits no act giving aid and comfort to the enemy, he is not guilty of treason. He may on the other hand commit acts which do give aid and comfort to the enemy and yet not be guilty of treason, as for example where he acts impulsively with no intent to betray.There's already a mechanism by which tax credits can be fully refundable (EITC for instance) partially refundable (American Opportunity Credit for instance) or not refundable (Foreign Tax Credit for instance).

In any case, I don't have a problem with refundable tax credits.  I don't see it as important that it's a waiver of tax versus cutting a check.  It's still the same fiscal impact on the government.If the government is giving tax breaks for giving to charity, that might end up happening in some cases.  I'm ok with that. Heck, tons of people don't pay income tax now.  If your income is under about $10,000 as an individual, your income tax rate is 0%.  Lots of people get more in refunds than they pay in taxes as well, due to the earned income tax credit, as well as refundable education credits.I was more thinking the point of failure would just be being unable to diagnose at all.  For instance, it just can't tell when the belt is worn and slipping because that's too touchy-feely for it to measure.

Also though, a vehicle being in the shop, especially a big expensive vehicle like a truck, is costly in itself.  Every day it's in the shop is a day it's not out making money.The AP is not just a publisher.  They are a news gathering organization with reporters and editors.  People don't submit articles to the AP to be published.  The AP is just publishing the work it produces itself, and which it allows member newspapers to republish under its terms.  Saying "according to the Associated Press" is no different from saying "according to the New York Times."This plan would make it much harder to pay zero tax for the rich, unless you can show my math or understanding of the law is wrong.

Right now, if you're in the top marginal tax bracket, a charitable contribution reduces your tax liability by 39.6% (plus a bit more if you have State income taxes).

Under my plan, you would owe tax on the whole thing, but get a credit of say 25%.  That would mean you still effectively pay 14.6% tax on money you earn and then donate to charity, as opposed to the current 0% tax rate.  It is a tax hike on higher income earners who have deductions.

Thanks, and we hope you understand!&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but if we're speaking about individual income taxes, isn't it a credit based on the amount saved that is given out, and not actually a deduction?

I don't think this is right, though I'm having a hard time parsing it.

For a tax credit, you get a fixed percentage off your taxes based on the money you spent on the creditable area.  So if the credit is 25% for IRA contributions, and you put $3000 in, you get $750 off your taxes.

For a deduction, it is as if you never earned that $3000.  It's taken off your income before your taxes are calculated.  The benefit to you depends on how high your marginal tax rate is, which is to say what bracket you're in.  If your income is low and your marginal tax rate is 10%, you would get $300 off your taxes.  If your income is high and your marginal tax rate is 33%, you would get $990 off your taxes.

&gt;We shouldn't really be encouraging people to donate to charitable causes for whom a donation to such a cause would represent a significant blow. If you're really counting on that end of the year tax deduction when making the donation then perhaps you shouldn't have made the donation in the first place, or have given less to the point that what you gave wasn't a serious blow to you.

Assuming people are rational actors, they'll likely only donate more to the extent they get a bigger tax break.  That is, it ends up neither hurting nor helping them, but letting the charity get a bit more from them.

In any case, I don't think we should be paternalistic about this.  People are smart enough to make their own decisions given the choices presented to them.

&gt;That last bit was more of an offhand comment. I'm just saying I think a charity would rather receive more money from less people who are capable of giving more than the same amount or less from a larger number of people for whom donating was a financial difficulty.

I think it depends on the charity.  The better counter argument to me is that by reducing the benefit to very rich people, I'm going to reduce charitable giving by them.  Right now I'm ok with that (as I see a lot of such donations being used on vanity projects like donations to Harvard or to art museums), but maybe there are some numbers you can use to convince me I'm wrong.I should have said it reduced your liability by 39.6% *of the amount you donated.*  That was poor phrasing.  If you're right on the edge of the 39.6% bracket, it might benefit you at 39.6% for part, and 35% for the remainder.

I didn't intend it to be misleading though.  I do believe that if you are in the top bracket (and not right at the edge) a $1000 donation will save you $396 in taxes, which is 39.6% of what you donated.  That's what I put in the OP.How is it more specific?  You can call the AP or go to their website to check, just like with the NY Times.

You might be right about it being poor form to just reference an organization, but that's not specific to the AP.  As well, such references are usually accompanied by a link, which lets the reader see what was said by whom.Your math is correct.  Under current law it costs someone making a very high income $604 to donate $1000.  It costs someone making a very low income (10% bracket) $900 to donate $1000.

I want to equalize those somewhere in the middle.  I want to do this for both retirement savings and charitable deductions and all the other stuff we give tax breaks for.

I don't see why we should treat the charitable giving tax benefit differently than the retirement account tax benefit.  What points can you make to CMV there?

&gt;If you count both "donations" and "taxes" as losses - is there a time where you will have less losses by donating more?

Not really, unless you're committing some sort of fraud by getting a benefit from the money you donated.&gt;Now, I don't know if I think he should be found guilty of treason, but its a fair argument that he should be at least charged with it and tried for it.

This argument does not make sense to me at all.  If I believe someone should not be found guilty at trial, I do not think they should go to trial.  Trials are for when the government thinks someone should be found guilty, and want to prove it by the mechanism prescribed under law.

I don't think as a question of law that Snowden's acts were adherence to the enemy. He clearly intended them to bring a benefit to the US overall (as he saw the benefit of being in compliance with the law and being free).  Intending to bring a benefit, even if you're wrong, is the opposite of adherence to the enemy.  Snowden disclosed the documents to a constitutional lawyer and US citizen, and gave instructions that they be released in as responsible a manner as possible to protect US lives and intelligence while still disclosing newsworthy facts.

See from [*Cramer v. United States,*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=treason+adhering+to&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33&amp;case=2809896451252158562&amp;scilh=0) 325 US 1 (1945)

&gt;On the other hand, a citizen may take actions which do aid and comfort the enemy \u2014 making a speech critical of the government or opposing its measures, profiteering, striking in defense plants or essential work, and the hundred other things which impair our cohesion and diminish our strength \u2014 but if there is no adherence to the enemy in this, if there is no intent to betray, there is no treason.&gt;You aren't getting anything back in the form of a tax deduction. A tax deduction means that the amount of the deduction is subtracted from your income and reduces your AGI before the tax is assessed.

I'm using "get back" as a colloquialism for obtaining of a tax benefit.  Do you agree you obtain a tax benefit of $150 (that is, paying $150 less in taxes than you otherwise would) in the situation I described?  I am in the 15% bracket for marginal tax rates, for reference.

&gt;I am not sure how you came up with your figures you used but I don't think you explained what the effect would be correctly.

Can you clarify what you think the effect of changing from deductability to a straight 25% credit would be then?  Maybe by comparing we can come to an agreement on terms which will allow productive discussion.&gt;There are 3 things that reduce tax owed. Deductions for AGI reduce your AGI. Deductions from AGI take AGI to taxable income. You take a standard deduction generally, unless your itemized deductions exceed the standard. 

I would favor replacing all three with nonrefundable credits.  For the standard deduction, I guess I would keep the rule regarding either taking the standard credit, or taking itemized credits.

&gt;Several deductions from AGI as well as credits are limited based upon AGI.

I would eliminate these restrictions.

&gt;However - we don't have to stick to a purely economic argument. I think there is significant social harm in making it easier for rich people to donate because it might represent their interests unfairly, even if the net amount going to charities is higher.
Is this your concern?

I would say this is my principal concern.  I see the current tax code as giving unfairly large breaks to high income people, and unfairly small breaks to low income people.

As a secondary thing, I don't think the paternalistic attitude about lower income people giving to charity versus saving for retirement is great.  The law should treat them as equal adults to anyone else.&gt; If a flat deduction is put into place, the effective marginal tax rates are significantly changed. The poor will pay much more, and the rich will pay much less. None of this is accounting for AMT either.

Walk me through your math here.  Even with phaseouts and the AMT (which I said in the OP I'd be eliminating), by requiring all deductions to be credits, I think I'd be substantially increasing taxes on high income earners.

For instance, someone who takes the mortgage interest deduction and is in the 33% bracket would see the value of that benefit fall by 8% if we moved to a 25% credit for it.  If the 25% value hurts revenue too much, I could see dropping it further to 15 or 20% depending on how much revenue is needed.&gt;The other purpose of taxes is to affect behavior.

Agreed there.

&gt;For example, sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol.

Those are excise taxes, and I'm not proposing to change them here.  Nor am I proposing a change to sales taxes or property taxes or anything.

&gt;What about business deductions? If a rich person pays out of pocket for the company and isn't reimbursed, they will owe taxes on the gap between old and new.

Are you talking about a schedule C?  I specifically said in my OP that this isn't about business taxes.  Or are you referring to the non-reimbursed business expense deduction?  I agree it kinda sucks, but at the same time I'm willing to live with that I think, if that's the only objection.

&gt;And what about people in the brackets lower than the %credit? These are lower income households that will pay more.

Wait, I think they will pay *less.*  If I am in the 15% bracket, and the IRA credit is 25%, I would get a bigger benefit from this plan than from just a deduction.  I think this cuts taxes for lower income people and raises it for high income people.

&gt;The real dollars of tax received will go down because the rich make up more real tax dollars.

Again, I think this is overall a cut for lower income households and a hike for higher income households.

I asked you before to walk me through your math.  I would still like you to, because this is a very important and basic point on which we're disagreeing.Sorry braco93, your comment has been removed:

The infrastructure to deliver electricity everywhere is already in place, we're just talking about the last hundred feet to charge people's cars. That will require some investment, but it's not too insane. Tesla for instance has already deployed a network of fast charge stations along most major interstate routes. And they're a relatively small company with nowhere near the resources of the Federal government. 

Will it take some investment? Yes. But we're talking about some parking spaces, transformers, and plugs. It's not really that expensive to build that. 

Edit to add: you can buy a commercial grade charging station for 2 cars for $3000. This is not totally trivial, but it's really not a ton for a business. I could see a business with a national footprint (McDonalds maybe) putting a charging station all in their parking lots as a promotional thing. $3000 per store as an infrastructure investment really isn't so much. 

http://store.evsolutions.com/mobile/turbodock---pedestal-p60.aspx?utm_medium=cse&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwkeiwBRCzmo-wiKL49pEBEiQAhvGKYRdhzNntCuH919-LeIpo1HX3sG81v_fucY7fE3d6eGkaAsXO8P8HAQMost car owners park overnight at their home 99% of the time. 

As long as the car can handle their daily driving, that would be enough for the large majority of their usage. That's how tesla sells cars, they have so much battery that it's very rare you'd blow through it all (200+ miles) in one day.   So you don't need to charge at every place you stop. 

And if there were a charger in every McDonalds parking lot in the USA that would put one within like 5 miles of 90% of the driving population. It would be enough so people wouldn't have range anxiety. McDonalds is ubiquitous. 

You might have trouble charging in Manhattan, but you also have trouble finding a gas station in Manhattan. Yeah, people have talked about that for a long time. It's a fundamentally silly idea that would be nightmarishly expensive to install and maintain. 

Apart from the absurd expense, you could never make all roads like that, and as long as you need some ability to go on noneletrified roads you lose the advantages of full electrification (no or almost no batteries). 

You can have specific routes that have overhead charging for busses or bus like vehicles. That's basically streetcars. I think there is probably diminishing returns there, and a 500 mi range car is too much range unless batteries get much more efficient in ways that are unlikely. 

Essentially you end up carrying hundreds of kilos of batteries as a security blanket nobody will use, and which reduces the efficiency and performance of the car while adding costs.

There are major tradeoffs to range expansion, and the tradeoffs grow a bit exponentially as you want more and more range. It's a similar but less severe case of the rocket problem. There are two components to this, engineering and cost, so let me separate them. 

On the engineering front additional range equals additional mass. Tesla is planning to manufacture a ton of lithium ion batteries but they're not going to be exceptionally lighter per ampere hour than present day batteries. Unless Tesla has developed some new battery type we don't know about, which probably wouldn't be a lithium ion, since we know about how much charge per kg you can get out of them.

As you add mass, it means you have to expend more energy to accelerate that mass, which diminishes the effect of the additional charge. If you take a tesla with 200 miles of range and exactly double it's energy capacity with additional batteries, it will go less than 400 miles on a charge. 

Additionally the batteries still take space. That will become increasingly difficult to scale with what people expect of a car. 

On the cost side, even at half the cost of current batteries a 500 mile range electric vehicle would be enormously expensive. There's a reason Teslas cost what they do, and it's mostly that the batteries are very expensive. You'd still be talking about hyper luxury cars having that sort of range. That still means you have the major cost of big batteries onboard the car.

But let me get into why this is basically impossible.

A road surface has the following issues to deal with:

* Extreme heat

* Extreme cold

* Rapid temperature variation

* Rain/snow/ice (sometimes all at once)

* Flooding

* Extremely heavy vehicles.

* Vehicles crashing on it.

* Snowplows

* Salt and sand

Right now, we primarily use asphalt on our roads, and that still needs to be replaced every 10-30 years depending on traffic and weather.

There is literally no electronics system you can put in a road surface that can handle these for the kinds of timeframes we demand of roads  It will be the world's worst maintenance nightmare.  The charging lanes will be closed 60% of the time for repair, and suck up the entire highways budget.

We barely keep up with highway maintenance as it is, and the roads are designed for 100% endurance.&gt; How do you explain the $35000 Model 3 that is to come out. Even if it will cost $40-45k, that's less than half of any other Tesla. That cost reduction is hugely from economies of scale more than anything else.

It still hasn't come out.  Tesla has been vaporwaring it for a while now.

But moreover my point was that taking that car to a 500 mile range would bring it back to 100k turf.

It is totally possible to make an electric car with that sort of range.  But I am saying it costs a lot more and has a lot less interior space and performance than one with less range, and I think very few people will be willing to pay the extra cost for range they'll rarely use.I don't ignore them, but such a car has a number of diseconomies.

First, it takes *more* than 2.5x as many batteries as the less range one, because as I said before, each battery has diminishing returns due to added mass.

Second, such a car will be unpopular and not sell a lot of units.  That will mean the per unit cost will be higher than a mass market car because of all the fixed cost that goes into a car model.  The batteries might have economies of scale, but the body and interior and such will lack economies of scale (and will have to be different to accommodate the mass and volume of the extra batteries)You asked me to justify my price projection for such a car.  The fact that it will be sold to people who are willing to pay more means that fewer will be sold.  Luxury cars sell fewer units by a large margin.

This car can exist, but I don't think it will be a popular choice due to expense and worse performance and space.I interpreted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3oe9tm/cmv_barring_a_massive_technological_breakthrough/cvwj34s) as asking me to justify the cost.

In any case, I thought initially you were saying that 500 mile range cars would be the norm.  I think we agree now that's not likely to be the case.&gt;They're still going to have to pay for getting those documents scanned digitally

This is mostly False, since attorneys are required to use the CM/ECF system which requires uploading your documents in PDF or other electronic format to begin with.  A small number of documents (from pro se filers or in certain unusual circumstances from attorneys) do need to be scanned in by the clerk of the court's staff, but they'd have to do that regardless of whether they were publicly accessible, because federal courts use electronic case files.

The space cost added by public access is basically trivial, and the bandwidth costs are likewise pretty trivial. The most expensive part of PACER is the part where you have to manage user accounts to demand payment and restrict access.  The USPTO for instance manages a similar public docket system with free access to the public (called the PAIR).

Also, I would far rather have it taken from my taxes.  Courts are the most important thing the government does, and public access to court records is fundamental to having of a free and open judicial system.  Presently the PACER system makes it difficult for researchers to do investigations into Federal courts for instance.  Any researcher who wants free access needs to be approved by the courts in advance and is subject to whatever restrictions they may wish to impose.

Let's say for instance that Google wanted to create a substitute PACER because their search and data management are miles ahead of the Federal Government.  They do this for patents and some court rulings already, so it's not a crazy idea.  This is 100% legal, since all records on PACER are in the public domain.  But the courts would never let them do it because it would kill their revenue stream.

If records access came from tax dollars, the courts would probably allow this.&gt;So you can view documents for free in the courthouse or house of records.

View, but not print.  If you want to actually have a record to keep in any way, it costs money.

&gt;What youre paying for is the convinience fee of viewing them off-site, at any time, in digital form. 

They're natively in digital form. The Federal courts use an electronic case management and filing system which means records are kept digitally from the outset.

And off-site access is cheaper for the government, because they don't have to supply the hardware or space.

&gt;Digitilizing things isnt cheap.

But PACER doesn't require anything extra be digitized.  The records are already digitized; this is just about access to them.

&gt;There are lots of labor hours that go into it.

Mostly from attorneys who are required to file their documents electronically, and then pay for the privilege of accessing the records.  It's a nice game, making the parties to litigation both do the work of digitizing and pay for access to those same digital records.

&gt;If the government couldnt charge, many courts would simply decide not to digitalize and just leave the paper copies as the only option. 

Lots of other government agencies and courts don't do this.  The US Patent Office for instance maintains a free-access electronic records system for all cases there.  As do most state courts.

And paper copies would be far more expensive to the courts because most of the documents never exist on paper.  The courts would have to invest in massive printing and storage infrastructure to have paper copies to begin with.

&gt;The question becomes: would you rather pay to view the online records, or not have those records online at all?

This is a False dichotomy that does not reflect how the federal courts actually operate and keep their records.&gt;Some guy has a passing interest in some random law or case will start downloading anything and everything connected to it. And no one is going to care how much they download or if they really need those documents in the first place because they are free. Thus the drain on the system will increase.

This seems unlikely given that this doesn't happen with the many other courts and quasi-judicial bodies which have free records.

And anyway, the cost of serving documents on a website is incredibly low.  As long as you stop bots from literally downloading everything en masse (with a captcha or a time limit this can be done), the costs of hosting are pretty trivial.

This is especially so when the government *does not own the rights to the records.*  Court records are in the public domain.  There's no copyright or lawful authority to prevent their reproduction.Can you specifically define what you mean by regulated versus unregulated capitalism?

Capitalism is a system which inherently involves property rights.  And property rights are themselves a form of regulation whereby the government sets rules about how things come to be owned and transferred among people and firms.

I think this is much more a question of how regulated you want markets to be.  Not whether they should be regulated at all.  And I think your post is just way too vague to get into the weeds of that yet.  So I'd like you to supply  more specifics if you can.

*edit: typo*The higher prices came because WA [massively raised alcohol taxes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/06/30/two-years-after-liquor-privatization-booze-in-washington-state-costs-more/) as part of the deal.  Costco isn't making a huge profit on those sales, and overall liquor sales are down, because the taxes are having much more bite than was predicted.

Washington's excise tax on alcohol is by far the highest in the nation at $35.22 a gallon, versus the nationwide median of $5.56.  Oregon is next highest at $22.73/gal.&gt;I have to think more about that to come to a great answer to this.

If you don't know what you mean by these terms I don't know how we could discuss them with any precision.

&gt;unregulated imo is the survival of the fittest, natural selection aka darwins point of view.

Regulation is an action by the government, and really isn't the same as evolutionary biology.  You can make an analogy to evolutionary biology in your discussion of what actions the government should or should not take, but you need the core of the definition to relate to government, not to biology.Sorry infinitestrength, your submission has been removed:

Interstate sports betting is illegal under federal law.  

There is a giant loophole for fantasy sports, which is why you see ads for those one day fantasy companies all over TV when you watch sports.You'll want to edit your post to put a semicolon on the end of that character string to make it a delta, or otherwise copy/paste the symbol from the sidebar.  

Edit: thanks.If anything, it would seem less likely with Vegas than other cities.  It's a lot harder to be an illegal sportsbook in Vegas, because the legal sportsbooks are heavy competition.  And players can't go to the legal sportsbook because they're likely to be recognized and their face will be on camera.  Casinos have cameras *everywhere.*

So that cuts down on players betting on themselves to do badly.

As far as the bribes thing, that's mostly a feature of college sports because the athletes aren't paid and are often desperate for cash.  Pro hockey players on the other hand get paid quite well.  You'd need to bribe them really big, especially the game-impacting stars, to make a difference.  When we're talking multimillion dollar bribes, location doesn't matter - it's trivial to have someone in Vegas or wherever on the phone to place the bets.When you say there should be more harsh punishment for violent rape, I think you're mistaken about how harsh the punishment already is.

For instance, rape by forcible compulsion in NY is [a class B felony](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article130.htm#p130.35) which is subject to a maximum [25 year prison sentence](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/felony_sentences.htm).  You could make it a class A felony, the same as murder, raising the maximum sentence to life.  I don't think that'll add too much deterrent effect though.

Violent rape is already a super severe felony.  Unless you're going to abolish the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, you can't make the punishment that much more severe.The right to free speech is broad, but not absolute.  Most relevant to this conversation, bribery is illegal and speech integral to criminal conduct is not protected by the Constitution.

So for instance, it is illegal for me to approach my Congressman and say "I will give you $100,000 if you vote for bill X."  That speech is speech integral to criminal conduct, and I can be criminally punished for saying it.

Many if not most Super PAC donations are essentially bribes of this type.  They're giving a good of real economic value (advertising) to a candidate or officeholder, with the expectation of some future benefit to the person giving it.

Because bribery is illegal, there is a government interest in reasonable regulations to prevent it.

If we look at the [US District Court decision](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2007cv2240-39) we see that the specific regulations in question were not about whether the ad could be aired at all, as the FEC had agreed it could air, but whether or not it was subject to the following laws:

&gt;Section 201 is a disclosure provision requiring that any corporation spending more than
$10,000 in a calendar year to produce or air electioneering communications must file a report
with the FEC that includes\u2014among other things\u2014the names and addresses of anyone who
contributed $1,000 or more in aggregate to the corporation for the purpose of furthering
electioneering communications. 

and

&gt;Section 311 is a
disclaimer provision. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441d. For advertisements not authorized by a candidate or her
political committee, the statement \u201c____ is responsible for the content of this advertising\u201d must
be spoken during the advertisement and must appear in text on-screen for at least four seconds
during the advertisement. \u00a7 441d(d)(2). In addition, such advertisements are required to include
the name, address, and phone number or web address of the organization behind the
advertisement. 

These disclosure regulations are quite plausibly reasonably within the power of Congress to regulate speech in prevention of legitimately criminal conduct.  Which is what the district court held.Sorry icculus88, your comment has been removed:

&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or **the right of the people peaceably to assemble,** and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

There are valid ways to attack Citizens United, but going after associational freedom isn't a good one.

After all, it would still allow very rich people to just buy the ads personally.That seems like a feature, not a bug.  An issue ad is much less effective as a bribe than a pro-candidate or anti-opponent ad.I'm not saying anonymity in general encourages criminality.  I am saying that the activity of spending large sums of money in a fashion that materially benefits particular candidates for public office has a strong likelihood of itself being a crime.  As such, you should not be able to do so without public knowledge.I don't think that is an accurate summary of the law.  Citizens United was and is organized as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit political advocacy organization.  This case wasn't about the activities that ordinary C corporations can undertake, but about the limitations on independent expenditures by political nonprofits in the periods surrounding elections.&gt;Thanks for the clarification: anonymous (large) donations to political candidates are problematic, and they're problematic because many such donations are criminal. So, hypothetically, 90% of such donations are bribery, and therefore Congress can deny anonymity to all such donations. Is that a fair summary? 

Yes.

&gt;Also, can I ask why this reasoning only applies to large donations?

Well, Congress has some discretion in the matter, so there's no inherent reason they have to include all donations.  There's a good case to be made that very small donations are unlikely to be effective bribes because they're not big enough to influence lawmakers to do anything.  This is for instance the justification behind the caps on donating to individual lawmakers which have historically been upheld.I still think the best case is not to talk about corporate form (since the rules surrounding corporate governance are a whole different ball game, and you're conflating public corporations with private corporations where these issues are much less clear), but rather to attack Citizens United from an anti-bribery standpoint.

Disclosure and quantity limitations on an anti-bribery basis are content-neutral regulations that could plausibly pass muster even after Citizens United.  But Congress has shown no interest in drafting them.Sorry domuseid, your comment has been removed:

The amount of money held by corporate interests in the US far outstrips individual wealth, especially when people who own the wealth don't want to put it at risk. That's a big distinction.

I don't think that's really True.  All property at some point has to be owned by a human being.  The only exception might be the government and nonprofit charities.

But corporations are owned by shareholders.  If the shareholders are other corporations, they'll eventually have human owners if you go through all the layers.  Trusts must have identifiable beneficiaries.  

&gt;There's nothing you can really do about individuals using their own money to press issues - look at Sheldon Adelson. That's not what Citizen's United was about, though.

You can deal with that via laws against bribery.  That's why I think the anti-bribery regulation avenue is the strongest one for campaign finance, it doesn't look really at what is being said, or the form of the speaker, but looks at whether the speaker is giving something of material value to a politician with the explicit or implicit understanding of some material benefit from that politician's exercise of their office.I think the corporate form argument is quite weak because we have long recognized that a corporation can take any otherwise lawful undertaking or expenditure if it complies with the rules surrounding how corporations make decisions.

And we are not willing to ban all corporations from all political speech.  Otherwise, we'd have to ban The New York Times Co. from expending corporate funds on candidate endorsements.But as a shareholder, I see companies take actions I disagree with all the time.  My recourse is to vote against them at shareholder meetings or sell my shares.  

For instance, I probably own a share or two of DirecTV, who are currently spending a lot of money to take a case on class actions to the Supreme Court where they're taking a position with which I disagree.  How is that different than them running an ad for Mitt Romney?  Both are political acts of a sort with which I disagree.

Companies are governed by laws which allow for majoritarian rule of the shareholders (as weighted by ownership).  If you don't like that scheme, don't buy shares of stock.

Besides, you're sidestepping the issue of 100% agreement among shareholders.  Let's say me and my 5 friends all get together to run ads supporting a candidate, and form a corporation to funnel our spending through, since none of us can afford the ads on our own.  All of the shareholders agree on running the ads.  Why is that different than if we just sent 6 checks for 1/6 of the ad cost to the TV station?In other words, yes, you're going to abolish the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.  Because [that's unconstitional.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/433/584)CU was a corporation formed for the purposes of political activity who were forbidden from engaging in electioneering communications within 60 days of an election.  

The only corporations allowed to make such expenditures were political action committees, and donations to such committees were capped by law.  Ordinary 501(c)(4) corporations could not make such expenditures.&gt;Can you explain why this argument wouldn't apply to speech itself, please? I.e.: Could Congress ban speech if, say, 90% of speech consisted of bribes?

I don't know how the courts would handle this situation.  If 90% of all speech of any type were part of a crime, everyone would be committing crimes all day every day.  It would be a total breakdown of law and society.  It's too silly to consider.

&gt;Thanks for explaining. Not sure I buy the argument, but I understand it now.

Don't get me wrong, I recognize that my legal views may not be correct - the court's interpretation of the law has varied over time, and the common law is by its nature a changing beast.  But the prohibition on bribery is a longstanding one, and bribery is a crime that the founders were very concerned about, so the idea of enforcing an anti-bribery statute is commensurate with the original intent surrounding the Constitution.Sorry noluv4uhoes, your comment has been removed:

This is complicated.  I'll try to give you the rough lay of the land.

There are certain types of speech which are not at all protected by the Constitution.  They are:^1

* Obscenity

* Fraud 

* Defamation

* Incitement to violence

* Speech integral to criminal conduct.

All speech that doesn't clearly fall into one of those categories has at least some level of protection under the Constitution.

Depending on the broad category of speech, you are afforded different levels of protection.  From least to most, you have commercial speech, ordinary speech, and core political speech.

Restrictions on commercial speech need to further an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest.

Restrictions on ordinary or core political speech are usually subjected to strict scrutiny, meaning they must be related to a compelling government interest, be narrowly tailored towards that interest, and be the least restrictive means of accomplishing that goal.  Core political speech (which usually means any speech about government at any level) will be especially protected.

So to restrict core political speech the crime in question must be a very important one,^2 the rule must not extend past what's needed to enforce the law against that crime, and must use as light a touch as possible to stop the crime and not restrict noncriminal speech.

----
^1 List derived from [United States v. Stevens](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-769.pdf) which helpfully lists them as a critical part of its holding that animal abuse porn was not categorically unprotected under the first amendment.

^2 It's not a lock that bribery would meet this standard, though there's a [recent ruling upholding a Florida rule banning judges from soliciting donations](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1499_d18e.pdf) that might tilt in that direction.I don't think a workable amendment can be written.  You'd have to change a huge portion of free speech law, which presently provides the US with the strongest speech protection in the world.    The best bet really is to have more effective laws against bribery and a better enforcement mechanism.  

For instance, Jeb Bush clearly was fundraising for his super pac before he declared with the intention of running for President, and was illegally coordinating.  There's a very good case to be made there, and a few successful cases of those types would probably curtail the worst activities substantially.

Alternately, you could provide sufficiently generous public funding with sufficient strings attached to cause candidates not to engage in these sort of shenanigans.  But by being opt-in, it avoids the majority of first amendment issues.That's an insane position.  You are essentially asking to abolish the essential principles that have safeguarded freedom in our country in order to give extra cruelty to some people you dislike.

You are literally proposing tyranny and torture.Sorry xxganjamastaxx, your comment has been removed:

I agree that there are some holes in my case here, if you wanted I could poke them pretty wide open.

But the point I really want to get across is that this is a very hard problem.  There is a genuine problem in American democracy when politicians are spending something like 70% of their time dialing for dollars, and where [a tiny number of people are spending nearly all of the money in politics.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/11/us/politics/2016-presidential-election-super-pac-donors.html)  There is definite evidence out there about money buying influence in a way that is very likely corrupt.

At the same time, the US has historically had the strongest free speech laws in the world, and I don't want to give that up.

Constitutional law is also a very complicated thing.  There are very few clear answers to be had.  Sometimes there are, like in [this interesting case about double jeopardy](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-5967_7m5e.pdf), but usually it's a lot harder than you'd think.Sorry coolasafool462, your submission has been removed:

The budget of a school is inherently limited.  Most schools are funded by local property taxes and don't have a lot of room to acquire more funds for new staff.

This is especially True in Michigan where major cities have been experiencing huge budget crises and really don't have the funding for adding staff to their schools.  Most famously of course there's Detroit's recent trip through bankruptcy court, but many other cities are also in distress.  Flint has also been under an emergency manager and does not have much of any wiggle room in its budget.

As such, you need to show that these positions are the best use of the school's limited budget.  Which staff do you think should be let go to make these positions available?

If you want to increase the school budget overall to pay for it, which other municipal services (sanitation, police, roads, ambulances, etc) do you want to cut to pay for it?

Having everyone at least apply to the local community college provides the best baseline you can do with a very limited budget for guidance.  It provides everyone somewhere affordable to attend, and which can be levered to going to a better four year school, often with less cost than going directly to a four year school.

Doing just a little more can be dangerous, since you can have students being advised to apply to selective schools that will not offer them a lot of aid and where they'll end up in debt.  There are some selective schools which are absolutely terrible choices for students from low income backgrounds.  [Sarah Lawrence College](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?195304-Sarah-Lawrence-College) for instance is basically a very fancy school that puts its students in massive debt.  Unless you're from a very rich family, you shouldn't go to Sarah Lawrence.&gt; Firstly, thank you for that case, it was very interesting. I didn't get all the references, but I followed the argument, with one exception. Namely, Illinois versus Somerville. I don't really understand why, if jeopardy is born when the jury is empaneled and sworn in, a mistrial isn't eligible for double jeopardy. I suppose there would have to an exception for cases wherein the defendant had caused the mistrial (or else he could deliberately torpedo the proceedings)?

A mistrial isn't a verdict.  Double jeopardy means that once you're found not guilty, you can never be tried again no matter what.  A mistrial is not a verdict on your guilt or innocence.  It's the "technical difficulties, please stand by" of court proceedings.

You can also be retried after a guilty verdict.  If, for instance, an appeals court rules a particular piece of evidence to have been illegally obtained, you could be retried without that evidence if the prosecution thinks they can still make the case.

&gt;Secondly, I'm not so sure there is a problem. Maybe I'm looking at it wrong, but I believe that ordinary (I.e.: middle and working class) citizens do have the funds to outvote current expenditures, but choose not to. Furthermore, the wealthy are a minority when it comes to votes, so there's a cost less way to defeat them every election-cycle. Finally, to address your point about fundraising, I agree that it may be a suboptimal use of time. Atleast, I hope it is. However, it may reflect the professionalisation of public policy: once upon a time Congressmen and women had to try and work things out, to a relatively large degree. Today, they have economists, journalists, and think tanks, to say nothing of their own private staffs. Besides which, opinion polls may have supplanted the town hall temperature-check. I'm not saying this explains everything, or that there isn't a problem, but I don't wonder if it isn't a bit overstated sometimes.

There's a case that it's overstated, but I do think it's a nontrivial problem.  We are clearly seeing public officials substantially changing their in-office behavior due to the donations of a small group of people.  Money causing public officeholders to do their jobs differently is basically the fundamental thing we're trying to avoid in banning bribery.

I do think that political ads are much less effective than politicians seem to think, so there is a bit of a point there.  But the behavior alteration on the part of officeholders is real, even if they are mistaken about how much the ads matter.&gt;The right to assemble sort of implies that they're doing so willingly, yes? When a company that isn't an explicitly political group acts in a political way, it very often contributes in a way that some of the people making up that company don't agree with.

When you buy shares in a company, you know the deal you're signing up for.  Under most (all?) states' corporate laws, public companies operate under majority share rule. You are aware the company may do things you disagree with if the majority of shareholders vote against you, or elect board members/executives whom you disagree with.  Your recourse is to sell your shares.

Majority share rule is the way companies make all their decisions.  If unanimous agreement were the rule, public companies would never do anything.

&gt;Further, a company isn't a political group and shouldn't be considered an "assembly," for these purposes.

Why not?  It's a group of people organized to some purpose, which naturally may intersect with policy and politics.  Should a company be prohibited from advocating before Congress regarding a bill that will impact their business for instance?

&gt;Lastly, even if they were considered an assembly of people, there's nothing in the constitution (to my knowledge; correct me if I'm wrong) that states that any person, group, or entity has the official right to contribute to a political campaign.

There is literally one sentence in the constitution about free speech.  If you wanted to take that one sentence very literally, it would probably cut against you and prohibit *any* law which impairs the freedom of speech or the right of the people to assemble, since it says "Congress shall make **no law**"abridging them.  The Supreme Court, in the tradition of the English common law from which US law arises, has crafted rules around this based on the cases brought before it.  In those cases, the court has held that political contributions are a form of speech.&gt;For point 1, I was pretty much talking about employees, not shareholders.

I really don't see the case here.  The owners of the company are the ones who get to decide how its resources are used.  That's a pretty important part of the definition of ownership.

&gt;Frankly, yes. The owner can and should go voice his or her opinion as a person, but he or she should not get to shout into a microphone made of money

This is a policy argument, not a constitutional argument.  Almost all effective speech involves some expenditure of money.  And the courts have held that the spending of money to further your otherwise constitutionally protected speech is a constitutionally protected activity.

If you want to ban spending of money on political speech, you need to define the line.  Am I not allowed to pay the train or bus fare necessary to attend a rally?  Am I not allowed to spend money on posterboard and markers?  Am I not allowed to buy a literal microphone or bullhorn?  Where's the line between money I can spend and money I can't?Sorry jrafferty, your submission has been removed:

The owners *are* the shareholders.  They do not owe a fiduciary duty to themselves; they owe no duty to themselves and can do what they damn well please with their company.&gt;This doesn't make sense to me, in light of jeopardy starting when the jury is impaneled and sworn in. Don't both those things occur during mistrials or retrials? How is that squared away?

It's a two part question, part one is "did jeopardy attach?" and part two is "did the court reach a verdict on the merits?"  If the answer is yes to both, then and only then does double jeopardy apply.

In the Illinois case, jeopardy attached when the jury was sworn.  And the court reached a verdict on the merits when it said the defendant was not guilty because the government had presented no evidence of his guilt.

The Supreme Court addresses this two part nature in the ruling.  The second part only gets like one paragraph because it's super clear.

In the case of a guilty verdict, if the defendant accepts the verdict, then double jeopardy would apply and he could not be retried.  But by appealing, the defendant specifically waives their right to keep the old verdict by asking it to be overturned.  As such, they can (sometimes) be tried again if the old verdict is dismissed on appeal.

&gt;What's the evidence that they're changing their behavior? Are you referring to the time spent soliciting donations?

Mostly that, yes, as well as the increased access donors get to politicians.Huh, I never had that issue when I was in college, which wasn't all that long ago.  Was it a particularly tight rental market where shenanigans were likely?It's not a terrible objective assessment to be honest.  Considering how high the dropout rates are at most colleges (50% is the national average) someone who comes to me with student aid as their source of paying the rent seems very likely to stiff me as compared to someone with money income from a job.I've removed this for appearing to be spam.In the context of an apartment near the campus in a town dominated by a college, if you leave your apartment in December, I might not be able to find a new tenant til August or September of next year.  

So yeah, you're very likely to pay the rent for the first semester, but for the second semester...?  This is doubly True if you're signing a roommate lease where finding a suitable person to take your room may be quite difficult.

If you have a job and a good credit history it's likely you have money in savings which lets you manage your bills well, and have a long history of paying your bills on time.Do you agree that property ownership in general is a fundamental right?

I think there is a good case to be made that the government should not be depriving people of ownership of their lawfully acquired property, no matter what property that is, and guns are a form of lawfully acquired property.That's actually not True.  For instance, when alcohol prohibition went into force, it was still legal to own and drink alcohol you had purchased prior to prohibition.  It just banned the sale of alcohol.

A gun acquired within the law today remains "lawfully acquired" even if it is banned tomorrow.&gt;In general, yes, but this isn't about the general case. This is about the specific case. Nobody who argues that people have a right to property also argue that people have a right to ANY property. People were once property in this country.

Unlike in the case of owning a human being, owning a hunk of metal does not inherently infringe on anyone else's rights.  Using the hunk of metal in certain ways can infringe their rights, and it might be a particularly heavily regulated hunk of metal, but it is not analagous to owning a human being, which is inherently an act of infringing others' rights.

&gt;First off, why not? If said property is dangerous or in the hands of someone explicitly with the intent to do harm on others (and, since we're in rights talk here, take away the rights of others), should the government not confiscate that property, regardless of how it is obtained? If a person expressed intent to create and use explosives, you don't just let him keep it after he's served his time, even if he legally acquired 500 pounds of fertilizer or whatever you need.

The government can and does regulate property in this manner.  The right to property isn't absolute.  The law requires that you not be deprived of it without due process of law or in the alternative, without just compensation.

If you go through legal process to show someone should be deprived of specific property for a specific reason, then the government can take that property.

This is much like how they can seize money out of your bank account if you're found guilty of speeding and don't voluntarily pay the fine.

&gt;So we should permit the sale of nuclear weapons or C4 to the common citizen?

These are different from one another.  It is possible to acquire high explosives as a private citizen, though not possible to acquire nuclear weaponry.  

The degree of regulation appropriate depends on the range of lawful uses and the danger to the public though, and the government can proscribe certain uses and apply certain regulations.  Guns are less dangerous than nukes, and have more valid lawful uses.  As such, they should not be subject to the wholesale ban that we put on weapons of mass destruction.

&gt;You completely missed the heart of my argument. Why should it be legal?

Because guns are useful.  Even in countries without a specific right to bear arms, guns are generally not banned.  Canada for instance has much stricter gun regulations than the US, but does not outright ban guns.  They even have [special reduced regulations](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/wild-sauvage-eng.htm) for when you're in an especially dangerous area where you might need a loaded weapon to defend against wildlife.

I think there's a strong case for more regulation of guns, much like other property is regulated.  But very very little property is outright banned, and I don't think there's a case that guns should fall in that small range of banned property.If such a law were passed in the US, it would likely be found to violate the 5th amendment, unless it paid market prices to buy back such guns.

The 5th amendment provides that "No person... shall be  deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." 

In the UK, you don't have constitutional rights, so Parliament can just do what they want.Eh, the US government is pretty damn rich.  There are around 300 million guns in the US?  At around $1000 each, that would be $300 billion.  That's a lot, but the US government could afford it as a one time expense if they really wanted to.

And "it's expensive to comply with the Constitution" is not an argument that federal courts have found persuasive.That's also not so clear actually.  Remember prohibition required a constitutional amendment.

There is a principle called "regulatory takings" whereby imposing regulation to the point where property is simply not able to be used or sold becomes effectively a 5th amendment taking.

For an interesting discussion of takings law on personal property, I'd direct you to the recent case of [Horne v. Dep't of Agriculture.](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-275_c0n2.pdf)Sorry ec6863, your submission has been removed:

Keeping and using property is one part of that right.  Creating and disposing of property is another part of it.

Property law of course is a complex thing, but I think there is a strong case to be made from a moral standpoint that gun laws should be subject to the standard laws of property, and that protection of all of one's right to property is a fundamental right.

For instance, such a law would essentially destroy the property of many business owners by making their gun manufacturing facilities, gun stores, and gun distribution businesses worthless by fiat.Please specify how you think this insurrection is going down?

Are they trying to claim specific territory as their own and defend that territory, or engage in guerilla warfare without claiming specific territory?  What is their level of support among the local population, and what are their rough demands?

The most obvious cases of suppressing insurrections are riot suppressions.  There have been periods where local areas take a day or two to be brought under control, but the US government can simply throw mass numbers at the problem if needed.  They can send hundreds of thousands of soldiers and federal officers, as well as nationalizing every state's national guard and marching them there.

Keep in mind as well, there are a lot of consequences to armed insurrection.  When you lose, you spend the rest of your life in prison.  That's an effective deterrent for most people.I find it implausible that such a situation would still have a cohesive US military.  Much more likely if such a situation were to arise is a constitutional crisis or coup d'etat.&gt; if we can't control the border in a time of piece during an insurgency it would be impossible. 

We could quite easily control the southern border if we were willing to use military force to do so.  As it stands, we are not willing to shoot people on sight for breaking the law against illegal entry, and thus we need to capture them, which is much harder.The US military is very much a part of American society.  If American society were so strained that a large portion of the population wanted to engage in violent rebellion, a large portion of the military would support them.  They would likely openly defy orders to engage an insurgency, and would possibly attempt to join it and/or depose the President.Sorry axearm, your comment has been removed:

If I buy property or it is willingly gifted to me, that's a lawful mechanism of acquisition.  If I steal it, that's unlawful acquisition.

The right of property under law does not generally allow all of the right of transferring property to be abolished.  If you say that my property cannot be sold or given away, you have deprived me of some of the fundamental aspects of owning that property.  It would be what's known in US law as a "regulatory taking" and I would be entitled to compensation from the government for the loss of property.The point I was trying to make to OP was that an attempt to ban ownership of guns invokes a fundamental rights analysis is that attempting to ban *anything* invokes a fundamental rights analysis.Also Lincoln was tactically brilliant to use the resupply of Fort Sumter as a mechanism to essentially force South Carolina to shoot first or else accede to the Federal government maintaining a key fort in the most secessionist city in the South.Cities are the economic centers of the world.  By concentrating a lot of people in a relatively small space, you get subspecialties that are not possible elsewhere.

For one small example, NYC can support a huge number of media businesses, such as NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, and HBO, all of whom are headquartered within a few blocks of each other in midtown Manhattan.  The fact that they're all right there means that a bunch of people can make a living doing things like set design, audio mixing, etc.  And the companies have a deep pool of talent to draw from when people leave.  If NBC were headquartered in Wilkes-Barre, PA, they might have a really hard time hiring some temporary set designers for a big production because there's not enough business there to justify an independent company doing just that.  In NYC, there is that demand, and such companies exist.

You get a sum greater than your parts by bringing people together in a city, because both people and businesses can become much more specialized.  And that fine specialization (called division of labor by economists) is key to growth.

So why does this mean you want more affordable housing?  It doesn't exactly.  It means you want more housing, period.  NYC has ~8 million people.  If the housing were built to raise that to ~10 million, which is quite possible with highrises, I bet the city's economy would increase by more than 25%, because more new specializations would be found and more people would become more specialized with a bigger potential customer base.

**TL;DR concentrating people together brings big growth, so you want more housing in cities to get bigger economic growth.**Yes, there is a fundamental right to own those things.  And we abrogate that right, much like we abrogate your fundamental right to free speech when that speech is "I will pay you $100,000 to kill my husband."  If you want to abrogate the right to property, you need to go through the legal process by which we decide the boundaries surrounding rights.The biggest way is to loosen zoning restrictions.  Generally most cities cap how much housing can be built by capping how tall or otherwise dense buildings can be.  If you loosen zoning restrictions and allow more apartment buildings and towers, developers will come in and build new housing without a specific government program.  Generally the new tax revenue from the new residents and higher property taxes on more developed land means it will pay for itself.&gt;I think a more realistic "government rate" would be $200 per firearm, so that's only $60 billion.

That is nowhere close to the retail price of a new gun.  And this will be litigated in a federal court.  I don't think it's likely you'd get anywhere close to that low a price.  I think people will be entitled to at minimum what they paid for the gun, plus inflation.

Also, Medicare principally covers people over 65. [The distribution of murder victims skews very young.](https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0311.pdf)  Assuming gunshot wounds follow a similar pattern, you're not gonna save much there.In trying for brevity I was overly simplistic.  I think guns should be treated like other property.  The government can't just ban any property it pleases, but it can undertake some policies to effectively ban it.

The precise nature of those policies is governed in the US by the 5th amendment, which has 2 provisions dealing with property:

&gt;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, **nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.**

I don't see guns as being special, but I do see the right to property as one that is worth defending.  Government can limit property use, but taking it completely requires either a trial to show why you aren't entitled to it (due process) or for the government to pay you for it.

So if the government wants your lawfully obtained smallpox sample, they can pay you the market value of the vial.To add on to this, since space in these cities is essentially fixed, a tax break will likely just turn into even more local inflation, because the prices are based on bidding wars, and if you make the people bidding have more income, they'll just bid higher.I don't think they would.  It would need to come from tax revenue.Oh, it has a snowball's chance in hell of happening.  I was replying to someone who said that the government literally couldn't afford to do it.  The government could afford it.  They just won't.I wasn't really advocating for affordable housing programs.  My preference would be to upzone drastically so that more people can live in the city.  It doesn't require a program exactly, just a deregulation.I don't think the policy choices taken by NYC are good at all.

You don't need to make sure the new housing has affordable units set aside, or make sure it isn't high end.  You just need much, much more housing.  

The Toronto area is my model here.  They don't have a large amount of policy about building affordable housing.  But condo towers are going up all over the place.  And it is actually effective at keeping housing costs down.  Land prices are through the roof, but families can find places to live because there are towers going up.

For instance, there are [145 10 story plus buildings](http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=12&amp;statusID=2) under construction in Toronto, versus [111 in NYC,](http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=8&amp;statusID=2) And Toronto has about 1/3 of NYC's population.

Toronto thus has had [fairly static rents](https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-toronto-rent-trends/) despite a huge housing boom.  

This is fundamentally about supply and demand.  There is an enormous level of demand to live in NYC.  If you don't increase supply to keep up with demand, then you're going to see housing costs bid up to unaffordable levels.

Instead of a lottery where a tiny fraction of people can get an affordable apartment, and where nobody who gets a rent regulated apartment can ever move because they'll lose their rent break, I think a large upzoning has the potential over time to actually make housing affordable for people who aren't in a government program.


If New York were building towers at the rate Toronto is, we would have 466 10 story plus buildings under construction, and that would do a huge amount to push down prices for ordinary New Yorkers.  

One last point:

&gt; I cannot imagine how a low income person could just get up and move-- and there are low income people in NYC who have to choose between riding the subway and groceries.

If your income is low and you are in NYC, you almost 100% have subsidized housing, either rent control, stabilization, or NYCHA.  If so, you cannot move.  You just can't, or you'll lose the subsidy that makes it possible to live in NY.  This means people end up having stupid commutes or inappropriate apartments (larger families crowded into 1brs and single older people in 4 bedrooms).  Regular working 9-5 taxpayers are the least likely people to start an armed insurrection.  They have an enormous amount to lose, and are generally quite risk averse.

In any case, there are many income support programs in place already, from welfare, to the EITC, to social security, to food stamps, which have not cause violent insurrection or anything like it.

If the policy is unpopular with voters, it will not get adopted or repealed.  Ordinary policy like this (especially policy that impacts everyone more or less equally) simply does not get violent revolutions to happen.There's a lot to address here, so I want to try and break it into three parts.  I'm going to address why I think current NYC zoning laws are problematic for building more housing, why I think things to set aside some housing as "affordable" are ineffective, and why I think the foreign buyers point is a red herring.

*  **Current NYC zoning laws are far too restrictive of new housing**

R10 is the densest housing zone allowed in NYC.  [It has a maximum floor area ratio of 10](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r10.shtml) which means that a 10,000 square foot lot can support no more than a 100,000 square foot interior building.  With walls and elevators and stairwells, that comes to about 15 floors.  If you want to build higher, you need a variance. You are generally limited in height overall, as well as being required under "tower on a base" rules to have substantial setbacks and only use about 1/3 of your building's footprint for a tower.  If you want to build a more traditional tower, you need a variance.  So if you want real high density housing, you can't do it within ordinary zoning laws.  You need to get special approval.

In Toronto by contrast, the highest zoning category is CR (commercial/residential) which allows an unlimited floor area ratio, and for basically whatever (nonindustrial) use you please for the building.

Second, and relatedly, **variances in NYC are fundamentally corrupt.**  You need to get support from local community boards and politicians, which essentially means you need to bribe people with campaign contributions, and you need to use the "right" contractors and subcontractors.  That adds huge and unnecessary cost and expense to developing in NYC.  It's also why the developers who do work in NYC are so skeezy; they're on one side of a massively corrupt system, and honest developers are pushed out.

Ontario on the other hand has a [province-wide zoning appeals system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Municipal_Board) which follows the precedent a city has set with respect to other buildings.  So variances from zoning can't be arbitrarily denied or held up for disfavored developers, and cities can't institute an NYC like regime of regularly requiring ad hoc variances for all significant development.

At a minimum I would upgrade R8, R9, and R10 zones to be unlimited height unlimited density, and bump most zones in the city up a zone or three to boot.  There is a lot of low hanging fruit out there on upzoning.  For instance the area around Jamacia station is one of the most transit accessible in the whole city.  And yet huge swaths of the walking-distance area [is zoned R2](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/zone/map15a.pdf), which is [a single family housing zone.](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r2.shtml)  That whole area should be zoned for skyscrapers.

* **Setting aside housing is ineffective.**

Like it or not, there is huge demand to live in New York City.  
If you set aside some housing as "affordable" you create two problems.  First, it does nothing to tamp down that demand, and second it promotes people gaming the system.

Setting aside units as "affordable" drives up the price of market rate units still further, as it means yet fewer of them exist for people to buy or rent.  The only way to bring down market prices is to add supply to the market.  And that means allowing a lot more new construction.  Using a lottery to divvy up housing is deeply cruel and makes it impossible for people to plan or make choices for themselves.  Most people will lose the lottery, and end up not being able to afford to live in the city.  But if we build more housing, prices come down for everyone, and we let markets allocate the scarce good like they do for every other good.

Also, importantly, when people move into new housing, they generally move out of old housing.  That creates vacancies and units that need to be sold or rented.  Market forces then act to make those units cheaper as supply floods the market and landlords/sellers need to find tenants/buyers.

* **Foreign buyers are a red herring.**

None of the policies NYC has address them at all.  And you couldn't address them if you tried.  You can't seize the property of foreigners or prevent them from buying property, because the Constitution protects the right to property.  You can't tax them extra because being a foreigner is a protected class under the Constitution and a tax on foreigners would be unconstitutional.

If they're gonna buy the units, they're gonna buy the units and there's nothing you can do to stop them.  What you can do is build even more housing so that their buying units doesn't have as much of a percentage impact.

As to the other global cities you mention, they should also be allowing more construction if they want affordable housing.  London is the worst offender here.  They really don't allow much construction there at all, and without that prices will just keep getting higher.Screen grab these and put them on paper.

But accounting for context and intent matters.  A zero tolerance policy on drugs means schools treat a kid having tylenol in their bag the same as a kid having heroin.  It leads to [absurd cases like illegally strip searching a 13 year old to look for ibuprofen.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safford_Unified_School_District_v._Redding)

Any policy which ignores context and intent is almost always a bad idea, unless the underlying act is one that has a near certainty of causing death or serious injury.I don't see why it's inhumane to require unanimity for a conclusive result.  Especially this is True in the context of criminal law.  We're not trying to say that we believe it more likely than not the defendant is guilty.

We are trying to say that it has been conclusively proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty.

A court acts on that decision to impose severe and life altering (and often life ruining) punishments.  Those punishments should be reserved for cases of extreme certainty about guilt, and requiring unanimity is one mechanism for preventing innocent people from having their lives ruined by an insufficiently strong case.Sorry, I removed this for rule C.

But yeah, sorry.  We like to catch these early to prevent that sort of thing.  If it had been up for a couple hours and had a lot of discussion I wouldn't have yanked it.Thanks for continuing to engage with me on this.  I do think there's a lot of agreement here on building a *lot* more housing in NYC.  I think from what you're saying you agree that it's the only long-term solution.

I do want to make a few points though, hopefully to change your view on either lottery based things like 80/20 or province/statewide zoning appeals.

**For zoning appeals:**

My fundamental view is that the right to build a tower on a particular parcel should not be a political decision to begin with, because ad hoc decisions are contrary to the rule of law.

The role of elected officials and government is to set and enforce general rules that apply equally to everyone.  That's what it means to have the rule of law - the same rules apply to everyone.  There is a proper role of officials and communities in setting those rules, but once they're set, they should apply to everyone the same.

Variances fundamentally are contrary to rule of law, because they're giving one person or developer an exemption from the rules everyone else has to play by.  

The Ontario Municipal Board essentially forces municipalities to keep within rule of law.  It operates as a court, not an elected body.  It does not set zoning rules for municipalities, but rather it adjudicates whether those municipalities have followed the rules they themselves set, and whether their enforcement is consistent with the precedents set by that municipality.

If I were doing this for New York, I would create a court of zoning appeals, with jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from any municipal zoning board in the state, and with appeal from the court of zoning appeals to the court of appeals (NY's highest court).

**For lotteries:**

My point about them is that they reduce the housing stock that exists at market rates, and thus actively hurt the people who lose lotteries.  The foreign buyers can still buy within the 80% that's market rate, so you don't exclude them, and it has no impact there.

But by reducing the supply of market rate housing, it means market prices go up, and so everyone who lost the lottery has a that much less affordable city.

I don't want to abolish all affordable housing policy overnight, it would probably be a 10-20 year transition to abolish rent stabilization and control for instance.  But in the long run it's a disaster.  And right now it's not a stop gap.  It's been in place for many decades and shows no signs of going anywhere.

Lastly, I want to address one thing you mentioned:

&gt; I'm not sure reducing the localized nature of the process is a good idea. I mean, who are we ultimately building for?

We are building for people who don't currently have a vote because they can't afford to live in NYC. There might be 50 people on a block near Jamaica station who don't want to be upzoned.  But there are 2000 people who would live there if you could put a tower up.  Those 2000 people don't have a vote in an election.  But I care about their wellbeing too.Sorry madmilton49, your comment has been removed:

1.  It is in fact a requirement for an immigrant to learn English before becoming a citizen.  [There are two tests you must pass to become a naturalized citizen: civics and English.](http://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/learn-about-naturalization)

2.  New immigrants are not entitled to welfare payments.  [Most means-tested programs have a 5 year bar from the date of becoming a permanent resident.](http://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/summary-immigrant-eligibility-restrictions-under-current-law)  Some (like SSI) are only eligible to citizens.  

3.  Driver's licenses are not citizenship documents, and foreigners can legally drive in the US.  [The US is party to several treaties allowing foreign residents to drive here.](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/86800.pdf)  Temporary and permanent immigrants to the US are legally allowed to obtain US drivers licenses as well if they choose.Both high skill and low skill immigrants have value.  There's of course nothing wrong with bringing high-skill immigrants into the US, but there's a lot of upside to bringing in low-skill immigrants too.

In poor countries it is very difficult to have your labor effectively turn into real productive output.  For instance, I remember a fascinating [NPR piece](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2010/02/podcast_dreaming_of_plastic_cr.html) about the difficulty of mango farmers in Haiti getting their product to market.  If they could get good, undamaged, mangoes to US markets, there would be a lot of money to be made.  But the lack of rule of law, lack of clear property rights, and lack of infrastructure made it basically impossible.

If you take one of those mango farmers and let him move to Florida, he can grow produce much more productively.  In Florida, your boxes don't get stolen, the refrigerated transport you paid for actually shows up, and if someone stiffs you, the courts actually work and they're forced to pay you back.

The same person working in Florida doing the same thing thus produces far more output than they did in Haiti.  That's real output of goods and services the world needs.  That person moving makes the world a richer place.  This isn't just about divvying up the pie, it makes the whole pie bigger.

Ultimately, all economic production comes down to human labor.  And bringing in more people means more labor gets done.  And because the US has such an efficient system for turning labor into value, that more labor in the US means everyone gets richer in aggregate.

To go to the extreme end of it, [this paper](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.3.83) makes a pretty strong case that fully open borders in every wealthy nation would roughly double world GDP.  That's absolutely bananas economic growth.Hi, CMV mod here.^1

First, I will point out that every subreddit is different, and enforces its own rules.  CMV at least tries to apply the principle of "content neutrality" in our rules, which means that we do not delete posts for being wrong or because we disagree with them.  We do remove posts which do not meet with our sidebar rules though, none of which relate to the correctness of one's beliefs, but are related to being clear enough to understand and being respectful of other users of this forum.

I personally have had many occasions where I allowed posts to go through and comments to go up which I disagreed with.  

Second, some subreddits are dedicated to specific projects, and do have rules against posting things which they believe to be incorrect.  /r/askscience and /r/AskHistorians for instance are quite strict that comment replies should be scientifically or historically accurate.

I believe the core of this though is that you're treating Reddit as if it were a monolith.  It's not.  Reddit is essentially a spin on forum software and hosting rolled into one bundle.  Different fora have different rules, and there isn't one moderator policy across the whole site.

---

^1 While I am a CMV mod, I am writing this on my own behalf and do not necessarily represent the views of the CMV mod team.  Also, my request to reply to your post with a distinguished comment just saying "No." was rejected by the other mods.&gt;So in essence, despite you being a mod, you still had to ask permission to speak freely, and when denied, you act like a good boy, don't you?

I did not "have" to ask permission, I talked about it with the other mods because I respect them and their input.

&gt;Also, please elaborate on the distinguished comment of "No", you planned to use, but didn't because your daddy moderator told you no.

A distinguished comment is highlighted green in Reddit's standard markup and is used to indicate that the person making that post is acting in their capacity as a moderator.

So, for instance [this comment I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3oqmws/cmv_collage_athletics_make_millions_of_dollars/cvzkeca) was a distinguished comment.

The point of making such a comment which just said "No." was that it would be funny, since you are making a rant about moderators, to have me speak as a moderator and just flippantly dismiss it.  But of course [now you've made me dissect the joke.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/2i8scj/explaining_a_joke_is_like_dissecting_a_frog/)

&gt;And, who is your daddy moderator? 

Nobody is my daddy.  At least, nobody on Reddit.

&gt;Perhaps I should be speaking with the mod with actual power, and not just a conformist to pressure.

No.&gt;I'm sure every mod has this story. The reality is that you should allow every post you disagree with to go through.

What?  There are posts I disagree with that violate the rules.  There are also posts I agree with that violate the rules.  I try to remove all rule-violating comments and posts.

&gt;I responded to a CMV regarding racism. It was pro-racism. I described racism as a sort of imperial ploy to get group A to fight group B, and basically a con, scientifically bunk, culturally irrelevant, and ignorant to the political motivations of it.
My post was removed because the mods felt I was insulting racists by depicting racism in a negative light.  I responded to them saying it was their opinion and their reading, which probably made them feel like racists.

Assuming you're referring to the post of yours which was removed 17 days ago and which you appealed, I don't think that's an accurate summary of what happened.  If you want to discuss it further we can, but I want to give you the option to keep it private so I will refrain from linking to it or being specific.  We generally keep modmail confidential.

&gt;That same day I would change another view in another thread. I wasn't awarded a delta because the mods found that the OP didn't adequately explain why his view was changed ;-)

Deltabot is a bot, and gives that message automatically when the delta awarding comment contains fewer than 40 characters.  So we didn't find that exactly.

If there was an explanation of the delta award though I can have a look and manually force add a delta if it is appropriate.Sorry evilgenius815, your comment has been removed:

For the most part, the consequences of such acts are pretty small, some people feel bad, you feel like a fool afterwards, and hopefully don't make the exact same mistake again.

But the fact of recording everything and posting it for public consumption with little if any context is adding wildly disproportionate consequences to the harm caused by bad behavior.  Losing one's job can be absolutely terrible, especially if it happens in a way that makes finding another job difficult or impossible.  You're talking about someone possibly going bankrupt, losing their home, and essentially ceasing to be a productive member of society, or at least ceasing to be as productive as they were before.

Doing that because someone makes a fool of themselves with a parking attendant is an absurd overreaction.  The actual consequences of such an incident are quite small in comparison to the consequences of doxxing or publicly shaming the person.&gt;As I stated, if you are a victim of harassment: threats, SWATTING, people sending pizzas to your house, prank calls, Black Faxes etc., then you are justified in doxxing.

This list contains some things which are merely annoying (prank calls) and some which are severe threats to human life (SWATting)  They do not belong in the same category.

The proper reaction to prank calls is probably nothing.  The proper reaction to SWATting is to criminally prosecute the person for reckless endangerment and filing a False police report and put them in prison.  Courts and prosecutors take SWATting really seriously, like [this guy who got 5 years in prison for it.](https://www.fbi.gov/dallas/press-releases/2014/man-faces-five-years-in-federal-prison-in-swatting-case)

I don't like doxxing in either case because it smacks of vigilantism.  Vigilante justice is seldom if ever justice, and this isn't self defense to me, it's just revenge.The easiest to me would be to have them set up, themselves, a weather balloon with a camera on it and have it get to a high enough altitude that it can see the Earth's curvature.  This is relatively inexpensive and easy to do, so that they can do it themselves and be reasonably assured that the experiment has not been tampered with.  Total cost to altitude including balloon, helium, and cameras of their choice is probably under $2000.  One issue with this you haven't considered is that it allows the employer to not actually pay the employee, but instead owe the employee debt.

A $115 Target gift card is an unsecured debt owed by Target to the posessor of that gift card.  Its value depends on the creditworthiness of Target, and the prices of Target goods.  If Target paid its employees in gift cards, and then [filed bankruptcy,](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/16/target-canada-suppliers-hit-by-retailers-bankruptc/) those employees would essentially be out their money.

This is somewhat of a risk with big companies like Target, which did declare bankruptcy in Canada, meaning that any Canadian Target gift cards are now worthless.

This is however a *huge* risk with smaller companies who may deliberately pressure their employees into taking store credit as pay because the company is on the verge of insolvency and can't afford to pay them.

This is highly detrimental to employees as well, because while unpaid wages are the most senior class of debt (paid above any bondholders), unsecured debts like credit cards are the least senior class of debt, and basically never get full value in bankruptcy.

It is also worth noting that in general, debt is not considered a valid satisfaction of a contract in a court of law.  If a company owes me money for work I've performed and gives me a gift card to the company, they haven't paid me until I redeem the gift card for goods and services of value.  Until either dollars or real goods and services of value change hands, the employee has not been paid. In the United States, it is not permitted, and [payment in scrip is not considered payment of wages.](http://www.twc.state.tx.us/news/efte/wh_part531.html#531_34)  If you owe me $1000 in wages, and you give me a $1000 gift card to your store, you still owe me $1000 in wages.

Marketable securities can be valid forms of payment, such as stock options.  But not gift cards, which are generally not marketable or transferable as securities.I don't think it's paternalistic to say that a debt is not satisfied until actual final and irreversible payment takes place.  As long as I can renege on my payment, I haven't really paid you.

Keep in mind that stores book gift card purchases as taxable income (and a corresponding debt) when accounting for the IRS.  That means if Target paid me in gift cards, Target would report to the IRS that its cost of employing me was $0, and would only book the loss on the cost of goods sold to me if/when I redeemed the gift card.  I'm not actually paid til I redeem.

If your argument is that laws which require paying your employees at all are overly paternalistic, I don't have much for you.  

But if you accept that the government can require businesses to pay their employees, I think it's reasonable to say that the government can require that they **actually pay** their employees, and actual payment involves transferring actual things of value, not just promises for future things of value.It is illegal to offer gift cards or a discount in lieu of pay.  It is perfectly legal to pay people in dollars and then offer to sell them gift cards or goods at a discount, even if the discount is conditioned on their being an employee.  In the latter case, they have already been paid and are now initiating a separate transaction.  If this solution is fine to you, then you don't want any change to present law at all, and I think your view has been changed.Your view seems to hinge on an historical accounting for fascism which plays off particular trends in early 20th century Europe.  

Given this, do you believe it is possible for anyone at all to be a fascist today?  

If so, please give an example of such a person.

If not, then this CMV is pointless, because it has nothing to do with Donald Trump, and everything to do with your idea that nobody today can be fascist.Sorry SexyTimeDoe, your submission has been removed:

That is, it does not particularly particularly matter that the country in question is antagonistic to culturally similar geographically close countries. That's just an historical artifact of the particular fascist governments in Europe pre-WWII.  

What people are getting at when they're describing a person or idea as "fascist" is that it has the important negative qualities of fascism, including extreme nationalism, racism, paranoia, demagoguery, and warmongering.  Hitler wasn't bad because he was surrounded by other European nations of somewhat similar power; he was bad because he started a massive war and genocide.

You're requiring that someone with the same basic viewpoint as a fascist leader *also* be in similar circumstances.  But I think those circumstances are fundamentally arbitrary.  A fascist leader can still engage in warmaking even if he controls a dominant superpower like the United States.  It might alter the manner in which the warmaking is undertaking, but that seems like a less important detail.

I'm not making a particular point about Trump here, but more generally making the argument that when we look at our use of language for terms like this, we should think about what the important elements are in context.

In the context of an academic discussion of historical political movements, yeah, the points you make about separating the era of fascist ascendency based on certain circumstances makes sense.  

In the context of using history as a guide for present action, it makes more sense to look at the aspects of historical fascism that made it so awful, and if we see those aspects arising, it is fair to call them out as fascist, because they are the bad part of fascism we care about.A genuinely new drug would be entitled to patent protection which would allow the pharma company who made it to charge high prices and recoup development costs.

The difference here is that Daraprim is in fact a very old drug, and the only reason the price hike is possible is due to the extremely high regulatory barrier imposed by the FDA, which makes importing it or starting a new production line nearly impossible.

Imprimis Pharmaceuticals is using a workaround of FDA regulations by making custom batches to order, which can be done by certain pharmacists with less regulation.

The better solution to raising prices would be to allow imports and exports of drugs between countries with good safety systems, and recognition of safety approvals by other countries.  This would greatly expand the pool of potential patients for any new drug manufacturer, meaning more drugs would be developed, and for off-patent generics, it would mean the market was big enough to support multiple competing firms for more obscure drugs like Daraprim.The question is what if any portion of the price hike will go to making new drugs?  My understanding is roughly none of it.  It is purely going to go to the profit of this guy.  It is just sucking money out of the healthcare system and into this guy's pocket.

&gt;Moreover, even if we were to expand the pool of patients who suffer from toxoplasmosis to include those from other countries, there would still not be enough incentive to produce this drug with good returns at lower prices.

The idea of economies of scale is very well established in economics, and I see no reason it shouldn't apply to manufacturing pills any less than it applies to manufacturing cars or clothing or anything else we trade internationally.If we're going to say that the right to end your own life is a fundamental human right, why is it preconditioned on being terminally ill?  

I have a friend who is severely physically disabled and would be incapable of committing suicide unassisted, but he is not terminally ill and should live many more years.  Does he have the right to physician assisted suicide if he decides his life is no longer worth living?*

*This is a hypothetical.  He is not suicidal.I wasn't really agreeing with you, I was pointing out that your argument extended to a lot more people than you were saying.

I will say that you seem to be a little cavalier in assuming that a person who wants to kill themselves is of sound mind.  In the law and by common sense, a suicidal person is at least presumptively, if not definitively, mentally ill, inasmuch as a mental state is causing them to want to harm themselves.

Especially in the case of people who aren't likely to die very soon, it seems like I would have a pretty strong presumption that they are not of sound mind if they say they want to kill themselves.&gt;This feels a bit wrong to me. If we look at the aspects of Islamic extremism that make it so awful and we see the aspects arising but they still are not extremism by definition....is it really okay to call that person an Islamic extremist? I'm with you for the most part but I'm not convinced it is "fair".

Can you clarify what you mean here?  Religious extremism to me seems to be defined by religious activities and organizations dominating your life, and causing you to exclude, aggressively proselytize to, or engage violently with people who hold different religious beliefs.

If you're talking about ISIS, then we're not just talking religious extremism, but some combination of theocracy and totalitarianism.  Sorry judojon, your submission has been removed:

Developing a new patent protected drug costs hundreds of millions or billions of dollars.  Opening a new assembly line to make a generic drug costs tens of millions of dollars.  All this would do is encourage a generics manufacturer to open a new assembly line for daraprim, because daraprim is generic.  

And that's the best case scenario.  Because so few people actually use daraprim in the US though, Shkreli can cut his price after the 2nd manufacturer starts making it to guarantee they'll lose money once the investment in the new assembly line is amortized, which means most manufacturers won't bother.

Oh, and to open a new assembly line you need to buy a ton of pills from Shkreli at $750 a pop for the FDA to compare yours to, because that's the rule.I was specifically not making the argument that Trump himself is a fascist, I was just making the case that a general argument about fascism should look at the elements of fascism that define its distinctive flavors of badness, not just the historical context of the early-mid 20th century.The only legal avenue I can see here is a claim for False advertising, but I don't think you'd win that.

[This is what you have to prove for a False advertising claim:](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5004718100648210208&amp;q=False+advertisement&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,31)

&gt;To establish a claim under the False or deceptive advertising prong of the Lanham Act, a plaintiff must prove: 

&gt;(1) a False statement of fact by the defendant in a commercial advertisement about its own or another's product; 

&gt;(2) the statement actually deceived or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience; 

&gt;(3) the deception is material, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision; 

&gt;(4) the defendant caused its False statement to enter interstate commerce; and 

&gt;(5) the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the False statement, either by direct diversion of sales from itself to defendant or by a loss of goodwill associated with its products.

Point (2) seems most problematic for you.  Advertisements for these products show pictures of them with the wheels.  Only [a moron in a hurry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_moron_in_a_hurry)^1 would believe the devices actually hover.  As such, it's not False advertising.  And without False advertising, there can be no restriction by the government.  A trademark claim from BTTF would fail because BTTF never marketed actual hoverboards for sale, which is a requirement of getting a trademark.

^1 I am not calling you a moron.  "A moron in a hurry" is an actual legal term.  It is my favorite legal term. The government enforces those regulations via lawsuits, and if it were to promulgate a regulation like this and attempt to enforce it via a lawsuit, it would likely lose, because it steps too far outside the bounds of what Congress has statutorily authorized them to regulate.

You were confused by a use of the term that did not involve its being sold to you. The use of words in newspaper articles is not something the FTC enforces.  They'd only be able to enforce based on actual advertisements/websites put out by the manufacturers of these devices, and those advertisements and websites are not deceptive because they clearly show wheels.It is worth noting that the relevant caselaw from all of this is roughly contemporary with rulings like *Plessy v. Ferguson,* which held that "separate but equal" was a-ok.

It's not clear that this law would hold up under the more modern interpretations of equal protection law stemming from *Brown v. Board of Education.*Sorry antihexe, your comment has been removed:

That 3 second gap of reloading would provide an excellent opportunity to rush the attacker.I think we're getting a little off the point here.  The goal of these laws is to make mass shootings more difficult.  And it does so, by making you either acquire illegal clips (difficult, expensive, and risk of arrest before event) and/or carry multiple firearms (difficult, expensive, and more risk of being noticed that you're armed.)

You may think it's not worth the trade-offs to do that, but your originally stated view was that you did not see any rationale.  A rationale you think isn't worth the trade-offs is different from no rationale whatsoever.It wasn't specified what jurisdiction we were talking about, so for instance a federal regulation which limited capacity would probably be much more effective than state-level laws, which are already generally undermined by the ability to purchase firearms and accessories in states which do not regulate them as heavily.Welding aluminum is actually really difficult.  Steel is way easier.

But technical niggling aside, my point was not that these restrictions are in themselves good ideas, but rather that the people proposing them have a rationale behind it which they believe to be accurate.  As I said, it was besides the point if the tradeoffs were worth it, since OP was saying they had no rationale before.  A bad rationale or one which isn't worth it is different from no rationale at all.

I can also talk constitutionality if you want.  I think there isn't sufficient caselaw for you to say if such a restriction is definitively constitutional or not, [although the closest case on point, evaluating the laws of NY and CT, says they are.](http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/87e1eae4-526f-4a2c-9cb4-3f5fe91f8908/3/doc/14-36_14-319_opn.pdf)&gt;&gt;A bad rationale or one which isn't worth it is different from no rationale at all.

&gt;Good distinction.

It's also a really important one if you're going to make persuasive arguments about gun control (or any other topic).  Very few people are craven and hold beliefs without what they feel to be good cause.  It is almost always correct to assume good faith and that there's something that at least is plausible about your opponents' arguments.

One thing I remember from a totally different context (philosophy class of all things) is that if I couldn't see what someone found appealing about a particular position I disagreed with, I probably didn't understand the position.

I came at this trying to convince OP that the people who wanted these laws were well intentioned and had what they believed to be good reasons for their desires.  It does not mean their actual policy proposals are good ideas, but if you want to persuade them of that, assume good faith and look for what makes them appealing.

&gt;While I believe that State restrictions on magazine capacity are in fact unconstitutional (that niggling esoteric mystery of what "shall not be infringed" means), States making laws infringing on firearms rights within their State is on an entirely different level of the Federal government passing laws which infringe on firearms rights on the national level. There is nothing within the Constitution enumerating the right of the Federal government to make laws pertaining to the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Even the unconstitutional NFA and Brady "ban" do not remove the ability to own the weapons they restrict, they just make it more difficult.

So I want to address this from a couple angles.  One is to distinguish between broader constitutional law principles and the particulars of the 2nd amendment, and the second is to specifically look at what 2nd amendment caselaw does and does not say.

First, I think your case about enumerated powers is quite weak as far as current caselaw.  You're asking for something much broader than just a question about gun regulation; this is about rolling back the entire federal regulatory apparatus.  We could debate that if you want, but it's not really a 2nd amendment question, and it's also not a question that the courts are going to revisit.  From a functional standpoint of what federal courts will find constitutional and unconstitutional today, they will find a general regulatory scheme constitutional.

Second, broad principles of constitutional law do allow the government (state or Federal) to impose restrictions on the enumerated rights in the Constitution.  Doing so generally is subject to one of three levels of scrutiny: rational basis, heightened scrutiny, or strict scrutiny.

The Supreme Court has so far declined to say what level of scrutiny is applicable to the personal right to own firearms, and was pretty explicit that they were not doing so in *DC v. Heller.*

As such, we can really only confidently say the following:

* Any restriction which passes strict scrutiny is constitutional.

So for instance, restrictions on the possession or manufacture of nuclear weapons clearly pass strict scrutiny.  They serve a compelling government interest (preventing mass death).  They're narrowly tailored (they ban only the weapon which causes mass death) and they are the least restrictive means (there's no way to be certain a nuke won't be used if it is allowed to be privately held).

* Any restriction which fails rational basis is unconstitutional.

This is what happened in *DC v. Heller* where the court found that DC's law was so overbroad as to totally ban ban the principal lawful use of a firearm, and thus could not survive even the lowest level of scrutiny.

Most regulations fall between these poles, and there aren't Supreme Court precedents telling us where to fall.  I think in general you will find that courts treat this much more like the right to due process or freedom of religion (subject to a wide array of restrictions as long as the core purpose can still take place) as opposed to the right to political speech (subject to exacting scrutiny and almost never restricted).

The 2nd circuit ruling is indicative of that I think, and appeals court rulings like that are pretty important precedents that other courts look at closely.This is one area where separation of powers in the US system makes a big difference.  If National Front or UKIP wins an election, they necessarily hold the seats in the legislature to put forward a legislative agenda towards their ends.  If they stop being able to do that due to internal frictions, they stop governing and a new election is usually held.

On the other hand in the US, there are multiple independent bases of power.  The House and Senate each have the power to stop legislation, and are totally independent of the Presidency.  Trump may win the Presidency, but it does not come with the power to make law.  When senior leaders of *his own party,* such as [the Speaker of the House](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/08/paul-ryans-succinct-near-perfect-response-to-donald-trumps-muslim-immigrant-ban/) denounce his proposals, it indicates that even if he were to become President, he would not be able to enact the crazy shit he's proposing.Yeah, I was more thinking of the westminster system in the UK where there's no separate executive at all. You title this as being about "social" conservatism, but are listing categories like war, health care and foreign policy, which are about as far from what are considered "social" policies as you can get.

Indeed, foreign policy is generally considered its own policy area, as distinct from economic or social policy.&gt;So maybe I'll have him or you (or anyone who knows law properly) clarify: if I name something a "color printer" and show on the packaging that it is clearly actually a model airplane, and note in the product description that it's a model airplane, is that legal?

Yes, much like a company can sell a computer and call it an "Apple."That gets into being more misleading, because there actually is a market category of printers which produce color pages, and it could be reasonably argued that the manufacturer is attempting to confuse consumers into thinking that it produces color pages.

From the case I cited before, these two elements would be key:

&gt; (2) the statement actually deceived or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience;

&gt; (3) the deception is material, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision;

In that case, it probably would meet those prongs of the test, and could potentially be banned.  

Find me a bunch of people who forked over several hundred dollars for boards they actually thought would hover, and you could have a case.Sorry kazizza, your comment has been removed:

So at the Michelin restaurant, the appetizers will taste better than the entrees at that restaurant, and at Bubba Joe's the appetizers will taste better than the entrees there.&gt;Isn't it a bit unfair to judge an appetizer, which usually only has one thing to offer, against the side dishes of an entree though? If you judge the "burrito bites" as tasting better than the chimichanga specifically because you were kind of 'meh' on the rice and beans that came with the chimichanga then it sounds like your method of judgment is off.

I don't think it necessarily is.  Appetizers are often taking the best parts of sides and putting them into a more composed dish, and leaving out the bulk that makes them meh.

&gt;Higher quality doesn't always mean better, especially when trying to go for a 'less is more' approach. It doesn't matter how expensive the crab in my artichoke crab dip is if there's so little that I can't taste it.

I don't quite get what you're after here.  If a restaurant is skimpy on it in an appetizer, they're likely to be even skimpier in an entree.  I was saying that in an appetizer, they aren't expected to serve a huge portion, so they won't be skimpy with the expensive stuff on average.

&gt;Appetizers do sell themselves more than the entrees once you've already walked through the door, but it's the responsibility of the entree to sell the entire restaurant.

I'm not sure I'm fully persuaded by this because a restaurant can make a good business by doing cheap but ok entrees, and then more expensive but tastier appetizers, essentially using the cheap entrees as a loss leader, and then the tasty appetizers to price discriminate between consumers who want a cheap meal and consumers who will pay more for better tasting stuff.

The entree may be more consistently value for money, but that doesn't mean it tastes better, which was the premise of my CMV.&gt;Every super fancy restaurant I've been to with real, qualified professional chefs (only about 3 places, IIRC), has had absolutely stunning dishes for every course, including the main.

I've been to quite a few super fancy restaurants (mostly in NY) and I still think appetizers at them are generally tastier than entrees.  The entrees are still really good, but the appetizers are usually really, *really,* good.

I think you might be able to convince me that there are broad types of appetizers that are typically below-par compared to entrees, or broad types of entrees that are typically above-par.  That would indicate it's more my ordering tendencies than an inherent thing.

&gt;In a lot of fine dining restaurants, including all of the ones I've eaten at, the menu comes as a full set / fixed price and there are no "optional" appetizers. A full menu may also have 5, 6, or 7 courses (or more!) and there is very little need for "filler" items. Also, fine dining restaurants use the highest quality ingredients in their mains (steak, seafood, etc.) since they are the "star of the show" in dining parlance.

I think tasting menu restaurants buttress my point.  They compose all the dishes to be more like appetizers at a typical restaurant.  It's a meal of appetizers!  And it's delicious.

&gt;As I said, your points only apply to some restaurants, certainly not all, and naturally they only apply to some palates, certainly not all.

I'll agree this is somewhat subjective, but restaurants are also a business, and one which definitely looks at what people want from their food in a rigorous way.  If you can show me a basis on which most people disagree with me, I'd CMV.&gt; In a lot of lower end restaurants I've been to (and even some I've worked in) very little effort is put into the appetizers, they are just treated as something to keep the customer busy while the chef prepares the main course. In a lot of cases the appetizer is entirely preprepared and just needs to be reheated or even just put on a plate/bowl.

That's a very solid point and I shall give you a !delta for it.  I have not worked in restaurants like that, so I didn't know that.I think I gave a pretty good reason it's not completely subjective, in that restaurants are businesses which look at the relative performance of these things with cold-hearted calculation, and showing me that some aspect of the restaurant business looks at this differently than I do would change my view.  

Indeed, that's why I gave [this person](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3wdltd/cmv_appetizers_taste_better_than_entrees/cxvd4q7) a delta.

&gt;There are salad apps that are just bland, boring, lettuce and dressing on menus that have a delicious T-bone steak main option.
There are app plates full of nothing more than fried ____ (potatoes, onions, squid, ...) that come out soggy and oily when not cooked properly, and simply boring/ordinary when cooked properly.

This is pretty similar to the point the other person was making, and I shall also give you a !delta for it.I will admit I was mostly thinking of slightly higher end restaurants when I was talking about this, and while the entrees at the places you listed and their ilk are really good, the appetizers at those places are (in my view) even better.

But your point about chain restaurants more or less putting out the same stuff in different configurations is very strong, and I shall give you a !delta for it.&gt;But if the restaurant has a delicious chimichanga, I'm not going to hold the 'meh' rice and beans against it. The burrito bites don't suddenly start tasting better than the chimichanga because the rice and beans that come with it aren't my favorite. 

I guess this is a pretty strong point.  I shall !delta you for it.  I shouldn't say the steak is less tasty than the app just because the steak comes with some less tasty extras.A *little* Ron Swanson-esque?  You could only be more Ron Swanson-esque if you [were sitting in front of a fire drinking Lagavulin in silence for 40 minutes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-ErOKpO4E)

Now that that's out of my system, I am having a hard time rebutting you.  I thin it's True for only a certain subset of restaurants, specifically ones that specialize in a single narrow type of dish, but that's a significant enough exception to my general point for you to get a !delta.Sorry magicalgiant, your submission has been removed:

That's the "contracts of adhesion" in my title.&gt;As for corruption, do not think that courts are free of it.

I work in patent law actually so yeah, I know about EDTX.  I'd pick EDTX any day over a mandatory binding arbitration if my consideration were just fairness.

It started turning a profit 5 years after construction, eliminated air traffic along the route almost entirely, and enables people to travel faster, more cheaply, and much more comfortably than by air or car.

So Taiwan got that for ~1/3 the price of what CA is looking at.  A lot of things stop making sense when the price multiplies.  Buying a car is a good idea when the car costs $20,000, and a lot worse idea when the car is $69,000.  And that's putting aside the logistical differences between the route (350 km != 550km).&gt;I doubt it's 1/3 the price if you count inflation and the distances / number of stations.

The $68 billion is [a very optimistic estimate](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-bullet-train-cost-final-20151025-story.html) for what will likely be one of the most difficult engineering projects in US history.  The US has persistently very high costs for infrastructure projects.  The reasons for this [are largely to do with politics,](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1307/1307.2176.pdf) and a project of this type is exactly the sort that goes way over budget.  Projects like this are rife with featherbedding and insider deals to use favored expensive contractors and subcontractors.  And the people pricing it have every incentive to lowball early.  I'd frankly be surprised for it to come in under $100 billion in today's dollars if it gets completed, though my guess is it won't ever get completed.

&gt;Still, in Taiwan it's profitable now. What's wrong with investing in public transportation when it can be profitable in just a few years?

It won't be profitable in just a few years in CA though!  The project costs a lot more, and the first phases are in low-population areas that won't sell tickets.  It won't be able to cover its operation costs (let alone debt service) until the LA-SF route is fully operational.  And that route is going to be nightmarishly expensive, which is why they're putting it off.

And because construction is going to take many more years than they're saying (at least according to the experts the LA Times interviewed), the project will be racking up interest on its early debt that will need to be financed with yet more debt.  This thing is going to be so bloated with debt that it will probably never be able to keep pace with the interest payments.  Reality TV stars are sometimes considered good actors, or at least valuable for selling products, and get TV deals for scripted or other reality shows.

But reality TV participants aren't actors in as much as their performance is much more down to editing than it is to intent.

For instance, an actor is trying to make his character appear to have trait X to get audience reaction Y.  That will influence how he comports himself and how he inflects his voice and such.

A reality TV star on the other hand is just doing what they're told by the producers.  The editing and production teams take the raw footage and make a story out of it, frequently by use of the reaction interviews and incredibly heavy editing to get what they want.  Some reality TV stars will of course try to be more entertaining to get more screen time.  That's when it gets closer to acting, but even then it's much more about manipulating the producers than it is about working collaboratively with them.One flaw of time rewinding is that it would destroy the entire financial system.

Almost all financial transactions depend on expectations about future events.  

If time rewinding became a thing, it would allow the rewinder to make trades based on things they know will happen, but that others don't.

So for instance, Consumer Reports recently unreccommended the Tesla Model S because of reliability concerns.  If I saw that when it just happened, and then hopped back a few hours to short TSLA, I'd make a killing.  And even if I couldn't trade, it's pretty easy for me to use proxies or accomplices to do it.

If that's known to be a thing which happens, it would grind markets to a halt.  Everyone would assume that everyone else was trading on future knowledge, and wouldn't want to make trades at all.  Of course every lottery and casino and other betting thing would also need to shut down.  You can't bet on horse races if someone can hop back after its done.

The mere *existence* of this superpower will have these consequences.  As long as people think this might be happening, they'll be forced to act as if it is happening.  

Other superpowers, like flight, don't have these sort of negative consequences from their mere existence.  And thus they're better.Did this change your view then?Generally I think we allow deltas where the explanation was upthread and they reply a little lower in thread with the delta when the reason for doing so is logistical.That happened, they explained it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3rdw96/cmv_reality_tv_show_casts_are_very_good_actors/cwn67vj)Green is because I put on my "mod" hat.  I'm a CMV mod and can mark one of my posts as being a mod post, which makes my username green.I think a lot of superpowers wouldn't change day to day life by their mere existence.  For instance, something like cyclops from X-men is basically just a very powerful weapon.  People with that power might be subjected to restrictions or tracking, but for the most part it wouldn't change anything.  For instance, the US lets people carry powerful weapons around all the time (guns).

Flight also wouldn't change much.  Spying with drones is already a thing, and while it's sort of annoying to some people, it hasn't drastically changed how society operates.  High security facilities already have to deal with the existence of helicopters and parachutes which let people come in from the sky.  And as big mammals, thermal imaging is pretty ok at detecting human bodies.

If you were the only or one of a very small number of people to have the power, yeah, the government would probably come after you to subject you to tests etc.  But if it was just something like "oh yeah, 0.001% of people can fly because of X" then it wouldn't be such a big deal.  So it would suck for those with the power for the immediate period after the power was discovered, but life would probably return to normal fairly quickly all around.So I said I'd give a !delta if you could show a lack of outright corruption, and I think you have done so.

It started turning a profit 5 years after construction, eliminated air traffic along the route almost entirely, and enables people to travel faster, more cheaply, and much more comfortably than by air or car.

So Taiwan got that for ~1/3 the price of what CA is looking at.  A lot of things stop making sense when the price multiplies.  Buying a car is a good idea when the car costs $20,000, and a lot worse idea when the car is $69,000.  And that's putting aside the logistical differences between the route (350 km != 550km).&gt;I doubt it's 1/3 the price if you count inflation and the distances / number of stations.

The $68 billion is [a very optimistic estimate](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-bullet-train-cost-final-20151025-story.html) for what will likely be one of the most difficult engineering projects in US history.  The US has persistently very high costs for infrastructure projects.  The reasons for this [are largely to do with politics,](http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1307/1307.2176.pdf) and a project of this type is exactly the sort that goes way over budget.  Projects like this are rife with featherbedding and insider deals to use favored expensive contractors and subcontractors.  And the people pricing it have every incentive to lowball early.  I'd frankly be surprised for it to come in under $100 billion in today's dollars if it gets completed, though my guess is it won't ever get completed.

&gt;Still, in Taiwan it's profitable now. What's wrong with investing in public transportation when it can be profitable in just a few years?

It won't be profitable in just a few years in CA though!  The project costs a lot more, and the first phases are in low-population areas that won't sell tickets.  It won't be able to cover its operation costs (let alone debt service) until the LA-SF route is fully operational.  And that route is going to be nightmarishly expensive, which is why they're putting it off.

And because construction is going to take many more years than they're saying (at least according to the experts the LA Times interviewed), the project will be racking up interest on its early debt that will need to be financed with yet more debt.  This thing is going to be so bloated with debt that it will probably never be able to keep pace with the interest payments.  Reality TV stars are sometimes considered good actors, or at least valuable for selling products, and get TV deals for scripted or other reality shows.

But reality TV participants aren't actors in as much as their performance is much more down to editing than it is to intent.

For instance, an actor is trying to make his character appear to have trait X to get audience reaction Y.  That will influence how he comports himself and how he inflects his voice and such.

A reality TV star on the other hand is just doing what they're told by the producers.  The editing and production teams take the raw footage and make a story out of it, frequently by use of the reaction interviews and incredibly heavy editing to get what they want.  Some reality TV stars will of course try to be more entertaining to get more screen time.  That's when it gets closer to acting, but even then it's much more about manipulating the producers than it is about working collaboratively with them.One flaw of time rewinding is that it would destroy the entire financial system.

Almost all financial transactions depend on expectations about future events.  

If time rewinding became a thing, it would allow the rewinder to make trades based on things they know will happen, but that others don't.

So for instance, Consumer Reports recently unreccommended the Tesla Model S because of reliability concerns.  If I saw that when it just happened, and then hopped back a few hours to short TSLA, I'd make a killing.  And even if I couldn't trade, it's pretty easy for me to use proxies or accomplices to do it.

If that's known to be a thing which happens, it would grind markets to a halt.  Everyone would assume that everyone else was trading on future knowledge, and wouldn't want to make trades at all.  Of course every lottery and casino and other betting thing would also need to shut down.  You can't bet on horse races if someone can hop back after its done.

The mere *existence* of this superpower will have these consequences.  As long as people think this might be happening, they'll be forced to act as if it is happening.  

Other superpowers, like flight, don't have these sort of negative consequences from their mere existence.  And thus they're better.Did this change your view then?Generally I think we allow deltas where the explanation was upthread and they reply a little lower in thread with the delta when the reason for doing so is logistical.That happened, they explained it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3rdw96/cmv_reality_tv_show_casts_are_very_good_actors/cwn67vj)Green is because I put on my "mod" hat.  I'm a CMV mod and can mark one of my posts as being a mod post, which makes my username green.I think a lot of superpowers wouldn't change day to day life by their mere existence.  For instance, something like cyclops from X-men is basically just a very powerful weapon.  People with that power might be subjected to restrictions or tracking, but for the most part it wouldn't change anything.  For instance, the US lets people carry powerful weapons around all the time (guns).

Flight also wouldn't change much.  Spying with drones is already a thing, and while it's sort of annoying to some people, it hasn't drastically changed how society operates.  High security facilities already have to deal with the existence of helicopters and parachutes which let people come in from the sky.  And as big mammals, thermal imaging is pretty ok at detecting human bodies.

If you were the only or one of a very small number of people to have the power, yeah, the government would probably come after you to subject you to tests etc.  But if it was just something like "oh yeah, 0.001% of people can fly because of X" then it wouldn't be such a big deal.  So it would suck for those with the power for the immediate period after the power was discovered, but life would probably return to normal fairly quickly all around.As civilian authorities, police are subject to the rule of law.  And a core principal of the rule of law is that everyone is subject to the same law.  The police *are* allowed to fire on others when their lives or the lives of others are in imminent danger.  But so is everyone, because self defense is legal.  But the police shouldn't get special treatment under the law prohibiting murder just because of their job.

Whether the situation you describe constitutes self defense depends on the particular circumstances.  If you're talking about riot cops with shields and helmets, a rock really isn't a deadly projectile, and the danger to life doesn't exist that would justify shooting.

Molotov cocktail?  Probably would provide legal justification, if the shooting could be reasonably believed to stop the imminent threat of more molotovs.  Just doing it for retribution is not sufficient.

---

A separate question is whether the police *should* shoot in those situations, even if it is legally justified.  The answer there is almost surely not.  Shooting into a crowd is very, very likely to result in innocent people being hit.  Especially so because many cops [have terrible aim.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/empire-state-building-shooting-nypd-response) Killing innocent people, even if they're in close proximity to dangerous people, is bad.

Moreover, shooting into a crowd is likely to result in violent reaction.  Especially if the crowd is penned in by fences (which is common at a lot of protests) the only escape route would be into the officers shooting at you.  When people are faced with imminent death in a scary situation like that, they may very well charge at the officers, and attempt to overpower them.  Sure, it's a crime, but who cares if it's a crime, because *there is someone shooting a gun at you.*  Once shots start getting fired, full scale riot is an extremely likely outcome.  That will result in more officer deaths and injuries, more innocent civilian deaths and injuries, and might spread into widespread disorder.

Because the last thing to note is that there's an incredibly strong social norm against shooting into crowds.  It is perceived as a wild overreaction and the people doing it are seen as murderers.  If you do this, there will likely be much bigger and more dangerous protests within hours, and quite probably full scale riots over a fairly large area.Some shaping the world is freedom.  For instance, the US Navy keeps a lot of shipping lanes open to commerce around the world.  Vessels from all nations can pass through the Straits of Hormuz (the straits between Iran and Saudi Arabia at the end of the Persian Gulf) because the US Navy has ships in or around it 24/7/365.  [When Iran recently fired some shots at a Marshall Islands flagged ship, the US began doing escorts, for instance.](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/05/06/navy-ends-mission-in-strait-of-hormuz/70892742/)  The fact that everyone knows the US will intervene to keep the straits open keeps all parties on side.

Likewise, China has been trying to aggressively expand its zone of control in the South China Sea, including by dumping landfill on tiny disputed islands to make them into military bases.  The US is [using Navy patrols](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/02/us-navy-south-china-sea-patrols) to essentially call China out for this, by sailing within what would be the territorial waters of those islands if they were in fact territories of China.  This makes it difficult if not impossible for China to effectively control shipping in the area, and means free passage for vessels of all nations in the area can continue.

The immense power of the US Navy has created True freedom of the seas in a way that has almost never existed in the world until the past few decades.  That means ships of all nations (including the US) can engage in commerce without fear of extortion or attack by hostile states.Well, I think once we get past people doing tests on you to figure out the source of your powers, flight would be pretty benign.  It doesn't let you do anything so extraordinary that you're a massive threat.  It doesn't have any immediate negative effects on others around you.  You might be able to get some cool specialized jobs with it, like world's fastest urban delivery person, but that's not too crazy.  You might be sorta useful as a spy or something, but a lot of what you do can also be done with technology, so you're not so extraordinarily useful as to be worth kidnapping/forcing to do the job.Some very short sentences are quite valuable.  For instance, this exchange on CMV is not too infrequent.

&gt;**A:** Given your view on X, would you agree that Y is also True?

&gt;&gt;**B:** Yes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;**A:**  If so then you have consequence Z which contradicts X.

The response of "Yes." from user B would get removed and they'd get a tempban, even though "yes" is a perfectly valid response to a question.Not necessarily.  Most of the time the explanation is just parroting, which doesn't add anything meaningful and just wastes time.

Further, the ban is likely to make people really angry, and thwart productive conversations.  If someone got autobanned from CMV, they might just say "fuck this" and walk away from the conversation.

I would never want to see a script on CMV which was autobanning people.  The most we let automod do is to remove specific comments when they get enough reports or trigger the spam link filters.So I think part of this is just to define what the theory of evolution actually says.  Because of course fish don't decide to be on land, and evolution doesn't say that they do.

The basic theory is a three step process:

1.  **Genes randomly mutate during reproduction.** Every time organisms reproduce, there are a bunch of random mutations in their genes.  This happens because DNA never copies perfectly.  There are always going to be a small number of copying errors, and those copying errors are mutations in the genes of the children.  Maybe 99.999% of the DNA will be passed on successfully, but 0.001% will get mutated.

2.  **Mutated genes sometimes cause changes in the organism.** Some of those mutations change some property of the child.  It could slightly change the color of their skin, how many red blood cells they produce, how acidic their stomach is, or any number of other things.  Most mutations do nothing really.  Of the mutations which do something, most suck and just cause some sort of malfunction.  But a small number of the mutations provide some useful change.  It may mean a bit longer of a leg, or more oxygen in the blood, or something else.

3.  **Organisms with positive changes are more likely to reproduce.**  For those small number of organisms which get the positive changes, those changes make them a little more likely to survive to reproductive age and have children of their own.  And since they'll pass on 99.999% of their DNA, the odds are very high they pass on the useful mutations to those children.  Over many many generations, the mutation will become more and more common, since each generation those with it are a little more likely to survive.  Eventually, over thousands of generations, it will become pervasive and all or nearly all of that species will have the mutation.

To the specific case of ocean-dwelling organisms coming to land, the most likely first organisms would have been in areas where land and water meet, and would have developed from mutations which led them to be able to survive short periods in the air (for instance, if waves deposited them on shore briefly).  And the first organisms to do this were most likely microbes.  For a lot more on the science surrounding this, I'd suggest [this paper](http://www.ecologicalprocesses.com/content/pdf/2192-1709-2-1.pdf)  I'll warn you though that it's super technical and meant for a scientific audience.I don't see any reason this can't be on CMV.  Having a view where you know you need more info about the other side is a fine starting point for posting here.The problem of mass surveillance is that it means if you ever are targeted, the government can dig up immense amounts of dirt to charge you with crimes or otherwise punish you.

For instance, let's say you were involved in a land dispute with a neighbor who happens to be a police detective.  Perhaps he didn't like the retaining wall you put up.  That officer, if he has access to these systems, can look up your history and use it against you. 

"Well, you know /u/raducu7890, I don't want to have to talk to your wife about your habit of watching [really nasty porn].  Maybe we can just resolve this retaining wall business amicably..."

This is of course a bit of a silly example, but police frequently use this sort of thing for leverage.  [In the US, the government frequently throws a huge number of different charges at defendants in an effort to force them to take a plea deal.](http://harry-lewis.blogspot.com/2013/01/why-prosecutors-can-bully-defendants.html)  They charge so many crimes of such a diverse nature that it's nearly impossible to fight them all.  As such, you have no choice but to take the plea deal, or else spend decades in prison.

It essentially means the government almost never has to go to trial anymore, because they have so much information, and have made there be so many crimes, that once someone is in their crosshairs, it's a certainty they're guilty of *something.*  Because of overcharging and oversurveillance, [innocent people frequently plead guilty to crimes.](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/nov/20/why-innocent-people-plead-guilty/)

Surveillance alone isn't the reason for this, but it is a definite part of it.  Getting the information needed to charge the defendant is a critical part of the game.If this person changed your view, you should award them a delta.  There are instructions in the sidebar.&gt;because the only thing keeping a real crash from happening are the rates being low coupled with investors thinking they won't be for long.

This doesn't make sense to me.  

1. If people believe rates are going to rise, then they'll price that into their current thinking, and act more or less as if rates have already risen. 

2.  If people believe rates are not going to rise, then they'll act as if they're not going to rise, regardless of the protestation of the Fed.

I don't see a case where the markets act both as if rates will and will not rise."Exposes" to whom?  Do you think the people making major bond and equity trades aren't keenly aware of the genuine status of the US economy and the expected path of Fed rates?

&gt;That said, I don't know of a credible Economist anywhere who honestly doesn't believe that the US economy couldn't handle a 25 - 50 Basis Point raise.

Depends on your definition of "couldn't handle."  There are credible economists who would say a 50 basis point rise might result in a minor recession.  Certainly [many credible monetary theorists think we shouldn't raise rates in December.](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/10/should_the_fed_1.html)I don't think being inaccurate will get people to address your main point.  Indeed, it is likely to make people go out of their way to address the inaccurate parts *instead* of your main point.

Presumably you'd like not just anyone to reply to this, but would like replies from people with some level of knowledge of economic and particularly monetary theory.  Those people *will* know what U3 means, and will think you're just wrong about unemployment.&gt;if it was a requirement to be keenly aware of the market in order to be a major market player, then there probably wouldn't be too many crashes, now would there?

You described yourself as being out of the Austrian school.  Do you think this belief jibes with the theories of Hayek and Rothbard?

The idea that a single government panel could outfox the entire market is anathema to Hayek's theory of information.  The core idea Hayek espouses in his seminal works is that markets can aggregate distributed information in ways that no central group of experts can.

Moreover, Austrian economists do believe that business cycles exist. [There's a whole Austrian business cycle theory.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_business_cycle_theory)  Just pointing to some recessions is not evidence for your point.The Fed *does* talk about alternate measures of unemployment!  They do it all the time.

This for instance is [a speech given by Lael Brainard:](http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20151012a.htm)

&gt;Domestic real activity has proven reassuringly resilient. Most notably, the labor market has continued to improve this year, pushing the economy closer to full employment. While monthly nonfarm payroll employment growth looks to have slowed over the past three months to a 167,000 monthly pace, so far this year it has averaged about 200,000. With these gains more than sufficient to absorb trend growth in the labor force, they have led to gradual increases in resource utilization. At 5.1 percent in September, the unemployment rate has declined 1/2 percentage point since December. **Alternative broader gauges of unemployment--which include individuals who are marginally attached to the labor force and employees working part-time for economic reasons--have also shown steady improvement this year.**

It even has a footnote that talks about exactly the things you're worried about.

&gt; Changes in the structure of labor demand, such as a shift toward occupations or industries characterized by flexible and part-time hours, may have led to an increase in the equilibrium level of part-time work. For more on this issue, see Cajner and others (2014) and Valletta and van der List (2015). If workers combine two or more part-time jobs to arrive at a full-time workweek, part-time employment could be elevated with average weekly hours at normal levels. But the logistical costs of multiple job holding make such an outcome unlikely, and in recent years elevated part-time employment has not coincided with an increase in official estimates of multiple job holding.

&gt;Interest rates are like, the price of borrowing money, right? I borrow $5, and I have to pay you, say, a $1 per month until the loan is repaid. So, it could be that OP thinks the price of borrowing is too low, and just like a sale at a store, everyone is rushing to buy the product at the reduced price (before it snaps back up to its normal level).

That is what OP is saying.  What I am saying contra to OP is that if that's the case, then the market would already build it into the rates charged for loans.  If everyone is trying to snap up loans, then the "shelves" of loans would be bare and the price would rise.

(The whole reality of the situation is of course way more complex than that, but it's the general idea).&gt;At this point, after the last seven years, personally I'd count anything short of starting the next Great Depression as a win.

Can you clarify what you mean here?  Are you saying that current rates are going to lead to a second great depression?

&gt;50 is admittedly extreme, but not the most extreme I've seen out there. It's all academic really because it's almost a foregone conclusion that the first rate hike will be 25 basis points or less.

Yes, they're almost certainly going to move in 25bps increments, though an announcement of 25bps now and probably 25bps next meeting has more or less the same functional effect as a 50bps hike now.  People price in future expectations.

&gt;On that, I completely agree. Personally, I'd like to see it sooner rather than later, but to be honest, I don't expect it before next December.

The next FOMC meeting isn't til December, so it definitely won't happen before then.  What do you think is the case for raising rates though?  Inflation is super low still.For the purposes of our hyper-simplified example, yes.

In reality, no, something different happens and in a much more complicated way.  If you would like the in reality version I can give it to you, but it's gonna be a wall of text, so I'd rather not spend 20 minutes writing it if you're not interested.A few questions before I begin, so I know where to condense:

Do you know what happens to bond prices when interest rates rise?

Do you know how the fed controls interest rates?

Do you know what the term "money multiplier" means?&gt;I'm not going to blame it entirely on interest rates, and I'm not going to go so far as to call it Depression 2.0, but I do think we're in for another, potentially catastrophic, economic event.

This is really vague.  Are you saying we're going to have another recession?  Well, yes, recessions happen.  If you ask "will there be a recession in the next few years?" the answer is "probably."  But you're giving a huge range of severity here, and no kind of timeframe, so this prediction doesn't actually predict much.

What's the counterfactual?  What's the worst case I'd see that's not as bad as what you're saying will happen?

&gt;Yes but you and I both know that there is next to no chance of this FED voting for back-to-back rate hikes. If/When they move, it will almost certainly be a one-and-done increase, and there's speculation that they might start with 25 basis points and drop 10 - 15 after the resulting sell off.

I don't think FOMC has ever moved in sub 25 bps intervals.  I very much doubt if they'd back off a 0.25% rate hike, and I don't think there'll be as much selloff as you're anticipating, since the fed has telegraphed their intentions fairly clearly.

&gt;I'm saying I don't expect the first rate hike until December of 2016.
As for the case for raising rates, it's long past time. Don't get me wrong, the last seven years of essentially free money have been great for my portfolio, but it hasn't done the Economy a whole hell of a lot of good.

Oh, I would say it's likely we'll get a rate hike by the end of Q1 2016.

&gt;As for the case for raising rates, it's long past time. Don't get me wrong, the last seven years of essentially free money have been great for my portfolio, but it hasn't done the Economy a whole hell of a lot of good.

What's your reasoning for this?  The USA has had fairly ok GDP and employment growth, and is not experiencing any serious inflation.  The downside to low interest rates is high inflation.  But price inflation is persistently low.  So I don't see the problem.&gt;I personally have read more rothbard than hayek, but im familiar. My point more applied to the current market system where there IS a central bank that has authority over interest rates and essentially the money supply, and major players make decisions based on that bank's moves. There is no requirement that you have to "see through" the Fed in order to be a major market player, is what I had meant. In fact, I'm sure plenty top dogs fully acknowledge it and intend to do what they can to take advantage.

My point though is that your premise is that Janet Yellen has *successfully hoodwinked the markets.*  You can think the Fed is distortive and makes bad incentives.  That's fine; we'll disagree but it's not a crazy-people position.

But to say that they have hoodwinked the markets is a much bolder claim.  It requires pretty powerful evidence, especially because if it is True, there is a fortune to be made from zagging while the market zigs, and no Austrian worth their salt is going to say market participants will leave that fortune on the table.

&gt;Hayek, unless I'm wrong about what little I have read/heard, was comparing the effectiveness of the free market absent a central bank, as opposed to with one. Not that the market is smarter than the central bank presiding over it.

Hayek was talking about central planning in general, not just with respect to a central bank, but more in respect to something like the USSR's total central planning.  And his point was that markets can suss out information far better than central planners.  And that's True.  And I think it's True in respect to the fed and markets, where financial markets can suss out information about the genuine path of the real economy better than the Fed can.

Remember as well that the entire reason the Fed would raise rates is if inflation were to rise.  But every market indicator of inflation is pretty low.  Low rates and low inflation at the same time is basically an unalloyed good.  Why wouldn't you want to continue it?Did I change at least that aspect of your original view then, that the Fed doesn't consider alternate measures of employment?Sorry c13h18o2, your comment has been removed:

1. You are on a bus or airplane or other environment where the toilet is probably very bad at its job and the smell will pervade.  If possible it's polite to avoid shitting in an airplane or bus toilet, because the toilets are bad at being toilets.

2.  You are at an extremely crowded venue where there's an incredibly long line for the toilet and shitting will hold up the line.  I've seen this at intermission during a theater show for instance, everyone needs to get in and out reasonably quickly to get back to their seats.  And the women's room line especially can be daunting.

In respect to point 2, men's bathrooms are a little different because of standing urinals.  Standing urinals mean that people can cycle through much more quickly than with stalls. The stalls can safely be used for shitting, because those who want a quick in and out pee have somewhere else to go.Hey, sorry I got pulled away.

So yes, bond prices fall when rates rise.  And the real mechanism here is going to be bond prices.

When the fed manipulates interest rates, what they're doing is printing or burning money* to transact with bonds, usually US Treasury bonds.

Right now, their target for short term treasury rates is 0% to 0.25%.  that means that if the rates on those start to get pushed up, we should see the Fed printing a bunch of money to buy the bonds and push the prices down.  That would increase bond prices and lower rates, because of the inverse price/rate relationship.

Right now though, the Fed isn't printing a bunch of money to keep rates steady.  They're just staying steady on their own.  [Monetary base, the amount of money the Fed has made, has been more or less steady for about a year at about 4 trillion.](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BASE)

Along with the non-expanding monetary base, we [aren't seeing a pronounced rise in the multiplier.](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MULT)  What that means is that there isn't sufficient demand for borrowing and lending at these rates that banks are shoving loans out the doors and/or borrowers are gobbling them up.  Were that happening, we'd be seeing the multiplier rise.  

With the multiplier and monetary base steady, it does not seem that the real economy is sufficiently demanding loanable funds to create meaningful inflation.  As such, there's a decent case to be made that markets are not overheated.  Some asset classes may be, and if the SF bay area were its own country, it would need a rate hike yesterday.  But overall the economy seems to be kind of plowing along without much inflationary pressure.

That's why there's not much pressure for the Fed to raise rates.  Low rates and low inflation at the same time is *great.*  Usually you can't have both, so we need to be watchful.  But if you can have both, it's very nice.

Please don't chase good faith users away.The fact that you agree with the OP, even strongly, and think that responses are illogical does not make it a bad CMV.  We have a pretty strict policy of not policing CMVs based on their subject matter like that.

And I think the fact that I *did* have reasonable counterpoints speaks to the fact that such counterpoints can exist.  

&gt;If I submit "CMV: I should be OK with farting in private, when I'm by myself" the responses cannot be made in a rational way. Some questions actually do have only one "correct" answer to them.

I disagree and think that almost any normative statement can be appropriate for CMV and have multiple possible correct answers.

If you think a post doesn't belong on CMV, the best route is to message the mods and ask for it to be removed or for us to message the OP.  Posts which do not express a clear view which can be changed violate rules B and/or C and can be removed.

If you just agree with the OP, then your best bet is to defend them to top level commenters who disagree.We nearly always will give a post some time to develop and see where people go with it before removing or intervening with OP.

You replied 13 minutes after OP had submitted their post.  That's not enough time for quality responses of any type to really appear.  Why not just give it some time and see how it works out?  Maybe there would be some surprising arguments?&gt;Last week a mother in Loganville, Ga. hid in an attic with her children to escape a home invader. Undaunted, the criminal came after them. She emptied all six rounds of her revolver, hitting him five times. He ran out of the house, drove a distance, crashed, and finally collapsed in a nearby driveway; police then transported him to a hospital for recovery. In the real world, one handgun round does not stop people like it does in the movies. This mother is very lucky she only faced one bad guy, and that being shot five times was enough for him to decide to leave her alone while he was still a threat to her and her children.

Can you link to this story?  Google news isn't showing me anything like that in the past week for Loganville, GA, either searching just the town name, or the town and self defense.  The only thing I found was [this about a fight with 2 men that ended with one of them shooting the other.](http://www.examiner.com/article/cops-man-who-gunned-down-brother-law-before-witnesses-acted-self-defense)The purpose of these laws is generally to make it onerously difficult to lawfully own all but a small class of firearms such as revolvers, bolt action rifles, or pump action shotguns.

It's not about magazine size per se, it's about making semi-automatic weapons unappealing and difficult to own.  More than that even, it's part of an effort to put as onerous a regulatory burden on guns as possible in an effort to stop there being as many guns out there.

If you think guns should be severely curtailed or banned, this strategy could make some sense, especially in the context where the US 2nd amendment prohibits more direct gun control such as is used in Canada.  If you don't want to curtail or ban most guns, then this policy probably isn't for you.

The point of it though is to make it so fewer people carry guns.  If that were the case, then the fight I linked above might just be a punching match, instead of ending up with a corpse.I understand that, and alone this law doesn't make much sense.

The point is that when a state like New York puts this sort of law on the books, it combines with 30 other laws on the books to make having a gun in NY more or less impossible.  You need specialized clips, specialized storage, special permits, the permits don't cover some areas (NYC has its own permits), etc.  It's part of a patchwork of laws that make lawful gun ownership as difficult as constitutionally possible.

It's like conservative states restricting access to abortion as much as is constitutionally possible.

Those startups are in turn bidding the cost of software development staff through the roof.

But that boom may bust.  If the tech sector goes down substantially in the next few years, you could be graduating into a field where there are tons of more experienced and more connected people than you vying for the small number openings at firms that survived the culling.

If it's just for the money, you're taking a much bigger risk than you realize.

After all, a few years ago you could've made great money going out to North Dakota to work the oil fields.  Not so much anymore.  There's a very real risk that software engineering will be the same.Sometimes a criminal law is declared unconstitutional.  In those cases, it means that the crime was never really a lawful crime in the first place.  

I think that if your crime or sentence is declared unconstitutional, that should apply retroactively.  The constitution was still in force when you committed the "crime" after all.Would you mind awarding a delta on that part then? &gt;What do you guys think the biggest problem here?

It's frustrating to our users to argue with a brick wall, and it's always a judgment call to remove posts like that.  The fact of it being such a judgment call leads bad posts to stay up far too long, which means more frustration.

No.  The bread is not two separate pieces.  It is at most an open faced sandwich, which is not a sandwich.

Neither.

&gt;Since y'all are volunteers there must be something keeping you here. What's your favourite thing about CMV? (Also, thanks for volunteering your time!)

I really enjoy working in a forum where people (usually) debate civilly.  Most places on the internet and real life people are either in shouting match debates, or have some less than honest reason to be debating their point.  This forum actually has really good and usually open debates.

For the sealed edge sandwich, does it stop working as a dish if you unseal the edges?

E.g. a pasty doesn't work as a dish if it's unsealed and between just two pieces of pastry.  Thus a pasty isn't a sandwich.

You realize that [even admins have to abide Rule 5 here, right?](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ribmq/cmv_the_robot9000_should_be_enabled_on_reddit/cwos7rg?context=1)

Also, **stop judging me.**Nope.&gt;A sub with a fully separated bun is just weird. Subs are long and tend to pack so well because it's open only at one end.

But the longest subs, such as party subs, are almost always unsealed. 

As to those two, they seem to be more for griddling your sandwich on a campfire than for sealing.  The second one shows an unsealed grilled cheese sandwich.

Grilled cheese is a sandwich, and does not require that there be only one piece of bread.Getting a substantial and diverse userbase is *incredibly* hard.  Branching off into its own site would get a small number of die hards becoming an echo chamber, and virtually no other traffic.

When you propose there be a new law passed, you should always consider how it will be used by someone whom you dislike when they're in power.

A law such as this would make it very easy for the politicians currently in the seat of power to arrest their opponents for "misrepresenting" the public.  

Moreover, such a law is incredibly vague, and would violate the basic principles of due process of law which have become universal in free societies.  Due process requires that people know what the law is so they can avoid violating it.  An overly vague and all-encompassing law like this does not put people sufficiently on notice as to what's legal and what's not.  First, it is important to recognize that even in the countries where left-liberal policies have had the most electoral success such as Scandinavia, free markets are *by far* the dominant economic model.  

The large majority of people work for private firms.  The large majority of goods and services are obtained by private exchange between individuals and firms.

When a person criticizes capitalism and points to a country like Denmark, they're either factually wrong or being disingenuous.  Denmark is a capitalist country by any meaningful definition of the term.  They have a bit more government intervention in the economy, but the private sector and private capital is still dominant.

Second, free markets are not something that just exist from a lack of government intervention.  Courts enforce contracts.  Police protect individuals and property.  That's government intervention.

The idea behind a relatively conservative policy regarding intervention is that the government's power is immense, and therefore quite dangerous.  Even well intentioned policies can cause unintended consequences from poor design or poor implementation.  And there's very little that can be done about it, because of the immense power of the state.Austrian economics != conservatism.  For instance, Milton Friedman was one of if not the most prominent conservative economists of the past century, and was emphatically not an Austrian.  Friedman's monetarist thinking was profoundly empirical, and his and Schwartz' *Monetary History of the United States* is essentially 100% empiricist.

I'd like for OP to clarify if that's what they meant or not.  Though they seem to have gone AWOL unfortunately.Removing sodium benzoate from food will kill people.

Preservatives are incredibly important for food safety.  They make food last as long as consumers expect it to, and prevent the development of (in the case of sodium benzoate) bacteria and fungi.

Sodium benzoate is particularly common in acidic foods, which most other preservatives don't work well in.  This is a particularly important area, because very acidic foods can disguise the usual smells and tastes which would indicate the food is spoiled.

Removing this preservative will cause a lot more people to eat spoiled food, which is very dangerous and can cause death.

Sodium benzoate is very safe at the quantities that the FDA allows. Removing it would be a disaster for food safety.Sorry generic_username96, your submission has been removed:

The general love for business and low taxes espoused by the Republicans is not something that differentiates monetarists and Austrians.  What uniquely Austrian policies have been implemented in the past 40 years?

I would say Friedman won the battle for monetary policy, and the Fed is now acting in a profoundly monetarist way, as you yourself alluded to with the 2008 collapse and response thereto.

What's the comparable policy victory for Austrianism?&gt;I know that there can most definitely be differences in chemicals that are created synthetically though.

This isn't True.  There might be other things alongside the sodium benzoate that have other effects.  But sodium benzoate is a very specific molecule.  Each and every molecule of sodium benzoate is *exactly* the same as any other.The danger of sodium benzoate reacting to become benzene is quite manageable, and does not require a blanket ban on sodium benzoate everywhere.  A much more specific regulation could easily do the job.

The risks you're talking about with cancers are very slight, and require very high levels of exposure.  But you also have to look at the benefits of preservatives.  Foodborne illness is also a threat to human health and safety.  The use of preservatives in food products is a major public health benefit which prevents a lot of death and illness from foodborne pathogens.

Sodium benzoate prevents toxins like botulinum toxin from getting into your food.I don't think the top level comment is of the type we would want to ban on CMV.  Using sarcasm to make a point isn't inherently against the rules here, though it has the potential to violate rule 2.

In general, the mods do not like to overly restrict the type or style of arguments which can be made, as long as they are not direct personal attacks on other users.That "clean" hot sauce may actually be more dangerous due to lack of sodium benzoate. Hot sauce in particular is a pretty dangerous substance because it is so powerful tasting that you really may not smell or taste when it has spoiled. 

A hot sauce without preservatives which is improperly stored (e.g. not refrigerated after opening) can get botulism in it. And while sodium benzoate is not dangerous, botulinum toxin is *extremely* dangerous. 

Proper food storage and hygiene can prevent the spread of dangerous bacteria and fungi without preservatives. But in the real world people don't engage in proper storage and hygiene. So it's good to also use preservatives to prevent dangerous pathogens. 

It is very easy for a single ingredient like "peppers" to actually represent something dangerous if it spoils or isn't handled properly. Not just that it will rot off the shelf, but more people will eat spoiled products. Foods without preservatives are not as good from a public health perspective all else being equal, since they make food borne illness more likely. The price of a brand new iphone is *much* higher than comparable android phones.

For instance, a brand new iPhone 6s+ with 64gb costs $850.  A comparable brand new Nexus 6p from Google costs $550.  The $300 up front is just an enormous price difference.  And the Nexus is sold totally unlocked and without any bloatware on it.Well, part of the advantage of looking at Android phones is that there *is* such a large variety.  You aren't limited to comparing to just the Samsung phones.  It may well be the case that OP is right about an iPhone versus an average Android smartphone, but there are above average values to be had out there, and because it's such a huge market, those deals are the best choice.So I think your point that he avoids sacks is not accurate.

What stat would he excel at to indicate he can scramble exceptionally well in the pocket?In western countries where Christianity dominates, the principal struggle of secular liberalism is to prevent Christian doctrine from dominating the state.  So, for instance, you see the fight for gay marriage rights as a fight to remove state sanction from a definition of marriage which is principally justified by religion.

In those countries, Muslims are a small minority who are frequently persecuted.  For instance, an attempt to build a mosque in Murfreesboro, TN has resulted in [arson](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fire-at-tenn-mosque-building-site-ruled-arson/) and [an insane legal battle by anti-muslim residents trying to stop it.](http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/02/fight-over-tennessee-mosque-has-cost-one-county-343276-so-far/358054/)

The christian majority in the area is trying to use the force of the state, or extralegal force if the state won't do it, to stop this mosque.  That doesn't happen for churches.

For someone who takes a reasonably consistent position that the government should let people do what they like with respect to religion, the attempted or actual use of government force to suppress particular religions in favor of others is something to be fought.

This is flipped on its head when you look at majority Muslim countries.  There, the struggle is to prevent the Muslim majority from imposing its religion on religious minorities including Christians. And that is a real fight, with most majority Muslim countries having very little if anything in the way of religious freedom.  Or, frankly, of any other freedoms.  Most are brutal totalitarian states whose policies should be opposed on a broad range of fronts.My view is that there is a consistent position of opposing the use of government compulsion to support particular religions.  The right to freedom of religion is the right to not have the government compel you to support or practice any particular religion, or prevent you from practicing the religion of your choice.

The core of the point is that in many cases, what Christians in the US want when they claim to want "religious freedom" for themselves is to suppress the religious freedom of others.Sure, the Catholic church is currently bringing a case to the Supreme Court [about the mandate in Obamacare to provide contraceptive coverage.](http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/11/court-to-hear-birth-control-challenges/)  The law *does* provide an exemption for religious employers to sign a waiver which lets them not pay for contraception.  Instead then, the claims administrator they hire would have to pay for contraceptive coverage from the administrator's pocket.

The Church is arguing that it should not even have to sign the waiver, and that it should be able to prevent the claims administrator from paying for contraception.  This is the Church in my view attempting to butt in between its employees (who may or may not be Catholic) and a third party private company, in an attempt to enforce its religious doctrines.  But the Church is framing it as religious freedom for them.Would this work in reverse?  Can we say that Mexicans have no business making criticisms of American cultural elements, or trying to honor American cultural or historical achievements?But who arbitrates that?  I would have a hard time finding a way to honor any culture that at least some members of that culture wouldn't find offensive.

For instance, if one were trying to honor American culture, one might go with a depiction of Thomas Jefferson.  Most Americans really like Jefferson.  But many Americans find him deeply troubling as an historical figure because he was a significant slaveholder.  

Or you might pick Lincoln, but many Americans in the South think Lincoln engaged in a war of aggression which subverted states' rights.

I don't think you can find any way to honor anything that won't offend someone. But you're essentially saying that no outsider can say anything ever, because *any* insider has an absolute veto on the speech of *all* outsiders.  Given the sheer number of insiders, it is a certainty that someone would be offended by even the most milquetoast dialogue.Has it been?

What people should do is not what they in fact do.  We can say people should drive the speed limit til we're blue in the face.  But without consequences for failing to drive the limit, they won't.

Deterrence is widely accepted to be a valid purpose of actions within the criminal justice system.  And posting of marked vehicles is a highly effective deterrent for roadway violations.

re: 2

Knives have a wide range of useful purposes.  Pulling people over in unmarked cars does not.  Further, it is strictly an internal regulation by the government of its own conduct, not an impingement of anyone's liberty.

If the government can do its job more safely, then the law should reflect that.

Also, there is a third point that pulling over people in unmarked cars is more dangerous for cops.  Unmarked cars can't have as big or prominent of a lightbar as marked cars.  That makes them more likely to be seen late or not seen by motorists when they're at the side of the road.  That makes it more dangerous for the officer.[There's substantial research that supports the claim.](http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/reports/economic_mobility/pewsharkeyv12pdf.pdf)

Edit: [for death penalty:](https://www.aclu.org/race-and-death-penalty)

&gt;While white victims account for approximately one-half of all murder victims, 80% of all Capital cases involve white victims. Furthermore, as of October 2002, 12 people have been executed where the defendant was white and the murder victim black, compared with 178 black defendants executed for murders with white victims.The point is that this law would ban cop cars which don't have the lightbar on the roof.  So if you see a car with only a light in the dash pulling you over, you know it's not a cop, because cops can't do that.&gt;I've seen marked cop cars without light bars.

And if I were writing this law, I'd ban them.

&gt;And criminals are known to follow the law right? They would never break the law and put a light bar on their roof.

The point is that if you do that, it makes it *really* likely you'll get caught, because lightbars are a pain in the ass to install and uninstall, and are really noticeable.The whole point of using an unmarked car for it is that people don't realize there are cop cars around.  It's internally contradictory for a secret technique to be a deterrent.

If you're saying the existence of unmarked cars will create a pervasive fear of cops that will lead to people acting within the law all the time, I'm not sure I buy that.  Certainly it doesn't happen in my experience, even though the police do use unmarked vehicles on roads by me.I was more going for some general stats on discrepancies.  I could spend a while going over a lot more stuff if you wanted.

I will give a slight grain of salt in regard to "controlling" for too many variables.  Multivariate regression analyses (the things you use to control for multiple variables) introduce more margin of error the more variables you try to control for.  Remember that controlling for income depends on having good income statistics.  You need to add in the error bars around your income numbers.  And then to control for education means you need the error bars around your education numbers.

It is quite possible to say "I want to control for these 6 variables" and have introduced so much noise that it would be nearly impossible for any real discrepancies to survive in the analysis.

This isn't meant to be a critique of you, but sometimes we know less about the world than we'd like.  There's a lot of data to indicate black people have worse lives in the US than white people.  But sussing out the sort of specifics we'd like for causality is just super difficult.  Important, but difficult.Sorry moos-dominus-est, your submission has been removed:

It's not like there's a question on the ACS where they ask 'On a scale of 1-100 please indicate your socioeconomic status.'The first link still does find substantial discrepancies between poor whites and poor blacks, even controlling for neighborhood.  It also finds that poor blacks are *much* more likely to be in poor neighborhoods than poor whites, largely as a result of racist housing policy.

&gt;In your second link I don't see any attempt to normalize for SES factors (or anything else, really, such as relative frequency of the types of crimes being compared).

Normalizing for SES is difficult on such a small sample size.  As well, there is only one crime for which the death penalty may be imposed in the US: murder.  They're all guilty of murder.*

*Okay okay treason also is a death penalty crime, but nobody has been sentenced to death for that since the Rosenbergs in the 50s.Just on the housing point, overtly discriminatory housing policy is much more recent than the civil war.

And even since, de facto discrimination has been an extremely persistent problem, such as the infamous [Yonkers, NY discrimination case](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/nyregion/02yonkers.html) which didn't end until 2007.To be clear, whether the reasons are de facto or de jure, racial segregation in housing is [highly persistent to this day,](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/) and cities with large minority populations are generally quite segregated, even if the citywide statistics indicate high amounts of diversity.

And since housing discrimination is such a recent phenomenon, it has directly impacted the lives of many if not most black people alive today.  As such, it's not so much a "past is past" question.  If you're a black person who is 55 years old today, you probably personally grew up in a black neighborhood because being in a white neighborhood was basically illegal.So /u/kenpopehat, free speech badass extraordinaire, had a [very good post about just this issue today.](https://popehat.com/2015/11/09/safe-spaces-as-shield-safe-spaces-as-sword/)

Safe spaces are a perfectly fine and necessary thing, as long as they are being created voluntarily.  Private association means that people can form groups and associations which exclude people or ideas which they do not like.  And that's all for the good.  It is actually incredibly important that an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting is a safe space for people who struggle with drinking to talk about their problems and get support from others.

To look at the subreddit where you are for instance, while there are virtually no restrictions on the topics which may be discussed, the manner of discussion is restricted.  Personal insults are banned, for instance.

When we're talking about the government. there is a strong case for having an extremely broad right to free speech, because the government is pervasive, and you can't just leave its control.

But within a private institution it makes sense to allow and even encourage the creation of safe spaces.  Lots of groups exist for lots of different reasons, and sometimes that reason is not to have debate.&gt;yeah but thats a "private" meeting not something everyone goes to.

I thought you were talking about such spaces within private institutions.

Can you clarify where you're objecting to "safe spaces?" Maybe give an example of an actual or demanded "safe space" which you think shouldn't be one?  Because I'm having a really hard time figuring out what you object to here.So anywhere outside of your private residence shouldn't be a safe space?

What about the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting I mentioned before.  That might be happening in a church or a library or community center.  Should it not be a safe space because it's in one of those places?Sorry g00dboy_dindunuffin, your comment has been removed:

China, with ~4x as many people as the US, produces much less in the way of real goods and services than the US.  The reason prices are lower in China is that Chinese workers are very poor, and it doesn't take much compensation to hire their labor, which reduces the labor cost of the goods and services one might buy.

But in terms of the actual value for human beings produced by the economy, the US smokes China.Canada actually attracts far more immigrants as a percent of its current population.  [Canada has 20% foreign born, versus US' 13.1%.](https://data.oecd.org/migration/foreign-born-population.htm)  As well, [Canada approves about 250,000 permanent resident applications a year.](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/data-release/2014-Q4/index.asp)  The US approves [just about 1 million,](http://www.voanews.com/content/us-issues-million-green-cards-and-naturalizes-757000-in-2012/1627155.html) however Canada's population is about 1/10th of the US, so it translates to Canada allowing in about 2.5x as many immigrants per year.Sorry, I meant that cops wouldn't be allowed to pull people over in cars without the lightbar.

And with TOR and other routing services, you can effectively disguise your location even using a registered line.Sure it does.  Even a registered SIM using a TOR network is basically unidentifiable.  The most you could tell is that at time X I sent some encrypted packets.  You can't know what the packets were or where they went.  TOR means that registration doesn't keep communication anonymous, since a TOR user can register but still be anonymous.Why can't they?  Criminals used to depend on payphones.

First, it very much harms and marginalizes those who don't or can't get ID.  For instance, someone who is in the US illegally wouldn't be able to get a phone legally.  So now they'd have to buy it off someone else who deals them under the table.  That will mess up your registration system, and create a new black market.

Second, it imposes additional regulatory burdens on a lot of stores.  Convenience stores probably just won't want to deal with this, and will stop selling them.  That sucks for consumers.

Third, it sucks for people who just have odd situations.  Tourists for instance would get screwed by this.  When I was recently in the UK, I got an unregistered SIM with a local carrier that cost way less than roaming would have.  If registration had been required, they might not have given it to someone without a UK address.It sounds like this person changed your originally stated view.  If so, you should award them a delta.Did it change your view about what the legal definition of coercion is?I have to say, this sounds a bit like post hoc rationalization.  It  *really* seems like you were trying to give a legal definition in your original comment.  Especially because you followed the definition by saying:

&gt;The key seems to be the persistent nature of it, so this would have a very high bar to meet in court.

The bar you have to meet in court is the legal definition, not any other definition.  You refer again to courts and crimes later in the comment.

I do not think there is any plausible reading of your original comment except that you believed that the definition you supplied was related to the legal definition of the terms you were using, since you were pretty emphatic that it was the courts and legal system who would be dealing with it.&gt;Yes, I was responding to that (in fact, I had perused that exact link before responding). Although I understand why we disagree about the overarching point, I am not sure what, in my comment, you feel was not directed at that?

When you asked how long the comparative advantage would last, I thought you weren't engaging with the concept as described by economists.  Comparative advantage is something which always exists as long as two producers are in any way different.  By talking about how much better machines would get than humans in absolute terms, and talking about how long the human advantage would last, it made me believe you were talking about absolute advantage, not comparative advantage.

&gt;Hmm\u2026 interestingly, I can't think (or find) a word in English for the distinction in French between 'dispendieux' (costly to maintain) and 'co\u00fbteux' (costly to buy). Self-checkout machines are costly to buy (humans are not\u2026 well to hire anyway) but they are much less costly to maintain than human workers (plus they don't require pesky time off, time to sleep and all other inefficiencies). I don't know what the mean time between failures is, but I expect the amortized cost to be much, much smaller than a worker (if only because stores are putting them in in the first place).

[This is undated, but a 4-kiosk setup appears to cost about $125,000 USD](http://web.mit.edu/2.744/www/Project/Assignments/humanUse/lynette/2-About%20the%20machine.html)  Assuming a store finances it over a period of 10 years at 4.5% interest, the machine will cost about $1300 a month, plus maintenance.  And at 10 years, you might well be looking at replacing or seriously upgrading the machines.

For the purposes of a business, something which is costly to buy versus costly to sustain is actually much less different than you'd think, since loans make most major capital purchases much more like spending over time.

Also the machine is much less flexible than a worker in bad ways too.  You can't cut down on the number of machines you have in store when business is slow.  You can't install extra machines for the six weekends leading up to Christmas when your store is totally slammed.

The machine is great if your store is busy enough to justify 4 cashiers on duty almost all the time.  Less so if you're really replacing 1.5 cashiers with 1 attendant.

&gt;If a sufficient percentage of the workforce is unemployable (CGP Grey points out that the Great Depression had only a 25% unemployment rate and it was terrible), then we're already in trouble.



I agree 25% unemployment is massive, though it's very different from just 25% of the labor force not working because they have something better to do.  Unemployment is the specific situation of wanting and not being able to find work.  For instance, overall employment rates in the 1960s [were far lower than they are today](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LREM25TTUSA156N), and yet we do not generally consider the 60s to be a economic disaster.  That's because the big change from then to now is women entering the labour force, not a change in unemployment where large swathes of the population want to work and can't.

As to your/CGP's claim about a large portion of the population being unemployable, I think it is falling prey to the [lump of labour fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy)  People, unlike horses, do not just sit on their asses.  They *find* something valuable to do.  They start businesses which the newly wealthy grocery store magnates and warehouse owners can patronize. 

A massive increase in productivity means we live in a society which can redeploy those people's labor to do things which currently don't get done.  It suddenly can become profitable to open a store in a somewhat depressed neighborhood that couldn't support it before.  Consumers get lower prices and more choices about what they want.  People will train themselves and work to get into the new jobs offered by the changing economy.  And there are lots of low/medium skill jobs which people can train for like that.  For instance, we just had a backup generator installed at my work.  Generators have gotten a lot cheaper lately, and so it became affordable.  And there were a bunch of skilled and apprentice tradespeople that came out to do the plumbing and electrical, putting down foundation, etc.  If the manufactured good of a generator were too expensive, we wouldn't have bought it, and those tradespeople wouldn't have gotten the roughly 20 man-days of work that went into the install.  So even if some people got laid off from the generator factory to get the price down, it doesn't mean fewer jobs exist overall.  And it means my work can do a little more business, because now we don't have to worry about power failures stopping us from doing anything.One thing which generally differentiates a high end smartphone is the quality of the screen.  Most of your fancier Samsung/Apple/Nexus phones are going to have really, really good screens.  If you want to watch a lot of video, that's a nice thing to have.

Second, high end smartphones generally have much more RAM than lower tier smartphones.  A lot of apps and UIs are choppy or crashy when you don't have enough RAM.  For instance, I recently upgraded my phone in part because I was having issues with doing music streaming and running map software at the same time (I take a lot of road trips).Sorry blaaaahhhhh, your submission has been removed:

Don't do that for me though, since I'm not the one who changed your view.&gt;So basically, your argument is that there will always be a comparative advantage in favour of humans vs machines. I think it is clear that, at least in the near future, this will remain True.

To be clear, this is *not* my argument.  Rather, I am arguing that humans will have comparative advantages at producing some goods and services (especially services).  Saying "humans have a comparative advantage over machines" is a meaningless statement.  You need to say something like "Humans have a comparative advantage over machines in the relative production of restaurant meals versus semiconductors."  Comparative advantage requires at least 2 producers and at least 2 products.  It is measuring the relative slopes of their production abilities in respect to the products.  As long as those slopes are in any way different, a comparative advantage (and therefore an opportunity for profitable trade and work) exists.

I'm sorry if it seems like I'm coming off pedantic here, but this is really the heart of my argument, and comparative advantage is a deeply counterintuitive idea.

&gt;I guess the core of my argument is that there is a floor below which comparative advantage is irrelevant: if we get to a point where we need a lot of education to just barely get by (not so much because necessities are so expensive themselves, but because they are very costly compared to what our labor is worth and paid).

See, this is where you lose me.  I can definitely see people falling behind the technological curve to an extent, but it is nearly impossible for me to see a society in which people can't acquire basic goods, and production of those same basic goods is *so astoundingly cheap* that there's no competition from even quite low wage labour.  My guess is rather that we will see lots of new industries and subspecialites crop up, and lots of complimentary uses of capital and labour.

Virtually every machine on Earth today interacts with humans all the time.  An airplane is crewed by flight attendants and pilots, and serviced by ground crew and maintenance workers.  If plane prices fall a lot, we will probably see more people flying around, and more people working with those planes, even if fewer people work with any individual plane.

Even if I do grant your premise for the moment though, it doesn't seem to imply the sort of dislocation you're worried about.

In a world of such immense wealth, we would almost certainly see the state provide support for such people at quite a high level, so that they enjoyed prosperous lives regardless of their productive ability.

We see this somewhat in the low population Persian gulf states with giant oil reserves.  Their economies just throw off so much in the way of resources that the government can just give citizens huge sums of money.

This is why I brought up the huge changes in the employment to population ratio from before.  That ratio can change without it being a disaster for people, as we see from the increase from 1960-1990.  If society were becoming wealthier and people chose more leisure as a result, that wouldn't be the same sort of problem as unemployment.  That's the reason I brought up the employment/population ratio versus the unemployment rate.  

On a final point, I lived in Quebec for several years (indeed, it's where I learned about comparative advantage).  Quebec labour law is absurd in many ways, and does a lot to keep people unemployed in the province.  Like the dumbass rule about not having more than 4 employees in a store after 10pm.

But let's say you're a grocery store in QC who is bound by that dumb rule.  Now with the self-check machines, your staff can actually handle an acceptable volume of customers at the late hours, and can afford to be open then, as opposed to having just closed before to avoid the rule.  So the existence of the machine means that the store is open when it would otherwise be closed, and people are working hours they otherwise wouldn't.

Same thing happens at a larger scale when a store opens where there would otherwise be no store, because the higher productivity means that its profitable enough to justify it, where it wasn't before.  

That's the mechanism I'm really counting on, as long as there's some role in the system for humans (which there is due to comparative advantage) having more efficiency just means we'll be way way richer, but still have people working, because there will be more stores, selling more stuff cheaper, and they'll be open for more hours.Sorry gabrielmodesta, your comment has been removed:

My favourite one in the US would be the Earned Income Tax Credit.  It was passed in the 1990s as part of Bill Clinton's welfare reform package, and essentially gives the working poor a bunch of extra money in their tax refunds every year (mostly those with kids).  A single parent with 2 kids making around $20k a year will probably get $4k back from the government.  

It's a very popular program among Democrats and Republicans.  Democrats like it because it gives money to poor people, and Republicans like it because it's tied to market income; you only get EITC if you earn some money from work.

Plussing up the EITC to be more generous and cover non-parents would be a way for a wealthier US government to subsidize people whose economic productivity is not very high relatively speaking.  And since it is essentially expanding an already very popular program, it seems extremely plausible that it would be within the range of politically possible solutions.Sorry capitalsigma, your comment has been removed:

1. You can still have civil penalties for violating regulations.  This is strictly about criminal prosecution, i.e. putting people in prison.  If you break a regulatory rule you can still be assessed a big penalty in a civil suit.

2. The "reasonable person" test means a reasonable person in the defendant's position.  So if it's a regulation relating to stockbrokers, the government can show it was on the licensing exam and therefore a reasonable stockbroker would know the regulation required X.  There are other ways too, such as if the government requires the pesticide come with a warning sheet about when it's legal and when it's not, which would put the user on notice about the potential regulatory violation.Sorry Urfeelsdntmatr, your comment has been removed:

This would be a question of fact for the jury to decide.  

&gt;So how is it even possible to regulate anything if proving violating the regulation requires proving that a "reasonable person" would know and also that they person did not know?

The standard of knowing violation is used all the time in the law.  The government routinely has to prove what people knew in order to prosecute them for a crime.  

&gt;How, too, is it even possible to have a standard about whether a reasonable person in a similar position knows about a regulation? Is a poll required of all people in similar positions to the violator? How do you qualify "similar position"? The jury isn't going to be people in a similar position to the offender. So how will they know?

&gt;If the prosecution brings in 10 stock brokers who all testify that they knew about the regulation, does that prove that a "reasonable stockbroker" knows about the regulation?

The prosecution certainly could use expert testimony to show that others in a similar situation would have known this was illegal.  They can also use common sense, such as by arguing that anyone would know you can't enrich yourself at your client's direct expense.  They can also get your emails and text messages showing what you were saying at the time.

Further, the "reasonable person" test is used in respect to prosecution and talking about people's specific situations all the time.  For instance, here is a California case where [expert testimony about battered women's syndrome was allowed to make a point about the reasonableness of the defendant's actions in context.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9566017733093582200&amp;q=reasonableness+training+manslaughter&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33)

I think the reasonable person standard is well worn in the law and there's a lot of caselaw to guide the courts.

To me, it seems sensible to apply this standard to areas where the legislature hasn't actually defined the crime.  If Congress defines the crime specifically, then ignorance is no defense.  It's only a defense to one of the many thousands of regulations published every year.  Your example of spamming is inapt, because [the criminal prohibition on spamming was written into law by Congress.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1037)The main constraining factors I see for Congress is that the process of passing a bill into law has a lot more checks on it than the process of promulgating a regulation, and the simple volume of statutes passed is far lower than regulations promulgated.

This leads to regulations which are much, much more specific than you'd expect to see from statutes passed by Congress, often relating to particular facilities or products.  So for instance, [it is a crime to attempt to collect a debt at the US mint headquarters.](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2010-title31-vol1/xml/CFR-2010-title31-vol1-sec91-9.xml)  Congress doesn't waste its time with penny ante stuff like this.

I guess my broader thinking here is that the immense scope of regulatory law has just created a situation in which there are way, way too many federal crimes, and I see this restriction as a way to cut down on their effect.  It may be a little arbitrary to pick out regulatory infractions, but since they comprise the bulk of the volume of federal crimes, while also being generally the least severe federal crimes, it seems like a good enough point to break away.Since you work in a regulated industry, I think your best case for changing my view would be to give me an example of a regulation which:

* A reasonable person (at least a reasonable layperson) would not think is illegal to do; and which

* Should be punished as a crime.

That is, are there things which seem ok, but which aren't, and which criminal punishment would be appropriate for?  A good example will get you delta'd.

The peanut example you gave I think does not meet the first point, and indeed the CEO was also convicted of several ordinary non-regulatory crimes for the same behavior.The issue with this lies at the confluence of prosecutorial discretion and plea bargains.

Prosecutors have pretty broad discretion to charge defendants with any plausible crime which their alleged conduct could meet.  So for instance, a prosecutor can charge someone who steals from a store and pushes the manager aside to leave with any (or all) of 

* shoplifting (usually a ticket)

* larceny (usually a misdemeanor)

* robbery (a felony)

If you charge him with a felony, even though it might not stick, it can give the prosecutor the power to strong arm the defendant into pleading guilty to the larceny or shoplifting charge.  If you were just charged with shoplifting, you wanna try out your defense that you had paid and there was a misunderstanding.  You're more likely to take a plea when losing means years of prison.

In doing this, you're essentially letting prosecutors put life in prison on the table for every assault.  They might not do it all the time, but when they want to extract a plea, they can add an attempted murder charge on, and all of a sudden they can strong arm the defendant by threatening a life sentence.

Because of that threat, a lot of people who might be or are innocent will take pleas, to avoid the very real risk of being sentenced as if they were murderers.  That's bad.Sorry AFK_ALL_DAY, your comment has been removed:

PP is very, very committed as an organization to offering abortion services.  Because they're one of a very small number of providers of the service, they see it as *by far* the most important thing they do.  Ordinary OB-GYNs offer most of the rest of their services, and while PP certainly wants to provide low income women with other reproductive health services, given that abortions are the hardest to access service by a huge margin, they see providing access to that particular service as their most critical service.Ok, the power supply issue is a good example, since we are talking about a legitimate threat to human life where we might get into like negligent homicide (an ordinary crime), but also where the "voluntary" nature of things could provide a potential out for a CEO pleading ignorance.

Have your !delta.Thanks for the delta.  I do wanna reply to this part which you edited in after my post.

&gt;Which raises maybe a more interesting question - if Planned Parenthood could not provide abortion services without the half a billion a year it gets in federal funding, then aren't taxpayers subsidizing abortion services?

&gt;Obviously that's not a violation of the Hyde amendment, but wouldn't anti-abortion people then have a point ethically about Planned Parenthood being funded by their tax dollars?

So in a sense, yes, PP is effectively using government money to help support their abortion providing operations.  However, in as much as the government can't ban people from getting grants because they do things which are legal, there's really not much that can be done about this.

A law which said that organizations which provide abortion can't get federal money for any services whatsoever would be unconstitutional, since the government isn't allowed to ban abortion, and can't use what amounts to extortion to ban it by another means.

Essentially, the government can't punish you for doing legal things, and as long as abortion is legal, the government can't punish you for doing it.If the government decided to totally defund all women's health services, yes, that would be legal.  But attempting to specifically defund planned parenthood and let other people get the funding still would not be legal.&gt;That's definitely not the case - consider any grant application process, some government agency sits down and decides who is worthy of funding and how much they should get.

The grant process the government uses is highly regulated, and criteria for decisions which are contrary to law are prohibited.  Do you agree that if Congress passed a law saying "black people can't get government grants" that would be unconstitutional?

&gt;The GOP is threatening to shut down the government unless PP funding specifically (and not other women's health services) is cut out of the budget. They couldn't threaten that if it wasn't legal.

Of course they can threaten to pass an unconstitutional law.  Congress passes unconstitutional laws for political reasons all the time. The courts would just enjoin the law from being enforced.&gt;They aren't threatening to pass any law though - there's no law that says how much funding PP should receive so there's no law required to change that.

There's a federal grant program called [Title X](http://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/) which provides funding for low income people to get reproductive healthcare.  That is where PP gets the large bulk of its federal money from.  

If Congress passed a law banning PP from getting Title X funding because they provide abortion, that would be unconstitutional.  Congress is free to repeal title X for everyone, but if they want to keep title X funding for anyone, PP has to be allowed to get grants on the same terms as any other provider.

This passage within that policy is troubling to me:

&gt;Be aware of the connotations of your language. Many
common expressions use discriminatory language so think
before speaking. Be aware of the language you use in
discussion and how you relate to others. Try to speak
slowly and clearly and use uncomplicated language.

This is incredibly vague and honestly condescending.  I should speak slowly and clearly using uncomplicated language?  This is supposed to be an institution of higher education where serious intellectual discussion can take place.  I think OP was sufficiently specific.  They pointed to specific policies of different universities to which they object.  Those policies may be  vague and ill defined, but that's not OP's fault.The policies being vague is a reason in itself to oppose them though.  A policy which punishes or censures people based on extremely vague rules discourages people from speaking their minds, since it is not clear what speech might be punished.I would have two counterpoints to this:

1. If you're going to say the examples given by OP are misuses of the policy, you bear the burden of showing that the uses are in fact misuses.  You need to show where the policy in fact prohibits its use in the manner of prohibiting speakers to say that prohibiting speakers is a misuse.  On my reading of the policy, its use to selectively censor speakers is the intended object, which is why they had a vote on allowing the comedian in the first example to come to the university to begin with.

2. Assuming you can show they are misuses, being prone to misuse is itself a fault with a policy, and I don't think you can hand wave it away as there being nothing wrong with it.  Good policies are much less prone to abuse than bad policies, and showing that a policy is frequently abused is a strong argument against that policy.I think the analogy to a cheating rule is inapt, because these policies are specifically intended to restrict certain undesired speech.  To see them used to restrict speech to me seems like prima facie their intended use, and if you want to say the specific restrictions are abuses, I think you need to justify that.  It seems to me like the intended goal of the policy is to prohibit speakers and events which engage with certain subjects or who espouse certain viewpoints.&gt;And if Congress told HHS that they could only pass a budget if there was $0 of HHS spending allocated to Planned Parenthood - it WOULD be in HHS power to change their current quantitative criteria rules to allocate it otherwise?

If Congress passed such a law, then Planned Parenthood would immediately sue HHS in federal court claiming the law was unconstitutional, and ask the court to order HHS to not enforce the provision barring PP from getting funds.  So it would only be in HHS' power if PP lost their  lawsuit.I don't think it makes them impossible to enforce.  To use my original example of Fish and Wildlife Service regulations, [this guy](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/canadian-caught-smuggling-51-turtles-in-his-pants-pleads-guilty-1.3345016) can clearly be shown to have known what he was doing was illegal, since the fact of strapping the turtles to his body to conceal them is very strong evidence he knew what he was doing wasn't allowed and he was trying to conceal it.

I seem to have accidentally replied to someone else in the chain when I meant to reply to you, and am deleting that comment.&gt;There are no laws preventing people from saying offensive stuff.

This statement is True in the US, but not True in other countries.

See, for instance, the Canadian Supreme Court case from a few years ago of [Saskatchewan v. Whatcott](http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/12876/index.do) where a guy in Saskatchewan was fined by the government for the following activity as described by the Supreme court:

&gt; In 2001 and 2002, Mr. Whatcott distributed four flyers in Regina and Saskatoon on behalf of the Christian Truth Activists. Two of the flyers, marked as exhibits D and E at the Tribunal hearing, were entitled \u201cKeep Homosexuality out of Saskatoon\u2019s Public Schools!\u201d (\u201cFlyer D\u201d) and \u201cSodomites in our Public Schools\u201d (\u201cFlyer E\u201d), respectively. The other two flyers, marked as exhibits F and G, were identical, and were a reprint of a page of classified advertisements to which handwritten comments were added (\u201cFlyer F\u201d and \u201cFlyer G\u201d).Sorry Regtik, your comment has been removed:

To change that, Congress would have to pass another law, either cancelling Title X entirely (constitutional, but terrible policy) or specifically banning planned parenthood / banning anyone who provides abortion (unconstitutional).

If Congress just zeros out funding for Title X, that would be the same as cancelling Title X, and would mean nobody could get government $ for providing reproductive health services.One important factor to consider is that a party coalition which wins enough seats to control all 3 branches is going to have major internal divisions which will prevent hegemony most of the time.

For Republicans to hold all 3 branches, they will need to have members coming from both their very safe seats in the south and west, as well as a lot of members from more suburban districts in blue states, such as [NY's 1st district which they picked up last year.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%27s_1st_congressional_district)  There's a really big gap between the interests of those members, and it shows in things like the recent leadership blowup around Boehner's resigning.  

The Republicans may be more than half the seats, but they may be too large and internally fractured to have a cohesive policy plan all of their members can vote for.

For historical examples of this phenomenon, you can see things like Bush Jr's failed attempt in 2005 to partially privatize social security, and the immense rifts in the Democratic party surrounding LBJ's pursuit of civil rights legislation, which needed Republican support to get it over the finish line.In the US, the use of laws against defamation (I'm going to use the term defamation from here on out just to avoid the spoken/written thing with libel and slander) in respect to issues of public concern is greatly curtailed for just this reason.

In particular, for private causes of action for defamation, when the alleged defamed is a public figure such as an elected official or candidate, an extremely high standard, known as ["actual malice" is applied to any claim of defamation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan)  So not only must a plaintiff prove the statement was False, but they also must prove that the defendant knew it was False and acted with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity.

That wouldn't apply in the Whatcott case, since by all accounts, Mr. Whatcott believed what he was saying to be True.

Moreover, the existence of such laws is highly dangerous, and they are very prone to abuse by the government to protect favored groups against legitimate public action.  See, for instance, [the threats by the last government of Canada to use Canada's hate speech laws against activists calling for sanctions on Israel.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-cites-hate-crime-laws-when-asked-about-its-zero-tolerance-for-israel-boycotters-1.3067497) As well, very recently, a France's highest appeals court upheld a use of their hate speech law to [fine activists calling for a boycott of Israeli goods.](http://www.thetower.org/2479-french-high-court-bds-is-a-form-of-illegal-hate-speech/)

Giving the government the power to curtail political speech based on the government's view that it is False or damaging is something I'm not really ok with.  The flyers Whatcott handed out were clearly aimed at changing government policy, and while they're something I strongly oppose, I can't get behind the Government of Saskatchewan fining him for criticizing the conduct of the Government of Saskatchewan.Le Pen is on trial for inciting *hatred* not inciting *violence.*  There's an enormous difference between those two.So I have lived in the US and Canada for considerable portions of time, and I think the benefit of the US system on free speech is that the *Whatcott* case is not an edge case in the US.  It is clearly and unambiguously protected speech under US law.

The issue with making such fine grained distinctions in the law as you're trying to is that it discourages people from speaking out, since the boundaries are vague.  Being charged with a crime is an incredibly severe thing to happen in itself.  You get arrested.  You might lose your job when you can't show up to work due to being arrested.  You need to spend huge amounts of your own money on a lawyer.  You face the very real threat of spending years in prison.

The threat of being charged alone is sufficient to stifle a lot of people from speaking, and means that a lot of things go unsaid due to that fear.  In US and Canadian law, this is what's known as the [chilling effect doctrine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect)

&gt;I'm not going to disagree with you that many governments are currently on a highway towards harsh censorships, but that's nothing to do with these types of laws that exist. 

I think it has a lot to do with these types of laws.  Hate speech laws are a major way in which robust free speech protections get eroded.  In the US for instance, because there is basically a "no exceptions" policy on government restrictions of free speech, there's no precedent a censorious law can cite to make the case that they should be allowed to restrict this particular class of speech.  On the other hand, hate speech laws can act as a precedent that the government can punish people for the viewpoints they espouse, and then it becomes the much blurrier question of which viewpoints are acceptable.

&gt; For instance, slander against a group could be covered by the same law as slander in general, with the same types of evidence being required, just with minor adaptions for applying to groups instead of individuals. So, for instance, if you spread information stating that homosexuality=pedophilia, that such be as bad as stating that a person is a pedophile, because it's harmful in just the same way. And the statement is easily dismissed as False. What the person believes shouldn't matter, since it's clearly meant to harm others. And it really does cause actual harm to people. Fatal harm.

First, your statement is internally contradictory.  You say that it shouldn't matter what the person believes because it's clearly meant to harm others.  But what it's "meant" to do depends *entirely* on what the person believes.  If they're a Christian and think that homosexuals are going to go to hell, they would genuinely and honestly mean what they're doing to be best for homosexuals.  I can (and do) think their belief in god and hell is wrong, but they genuinely do believe it.

Second, you can't shoehorn this into defamation law the way you'd like.  A claim for defamation requires actual damages.  It isn't sufficient to show that I said something nasty about you.  You'd need to show that what I said had a direct impact on you, such as causing you to get fired from your job.  Hypothetical damage to unknown people isn't sufficient for damages in any lawsuit about anything.  If you can show the speech caused concrete damage or violence to specific people you might have a case.  In the case of violence especially you'd have a good case for prosecuting the speaker for conspiracy to commit the violent act.

Third, a defamatory statement must not be a statement of opinion.  Saying that homosexuality is morally equivalent to pedophilia is a statement of opinion, at least as far as the law is concerned.  Everyone is entitled to their own moral opinions.  Defamatory statements must be specific statements of fact, that a particular thing happened in the real world.The time cost of having every single passenger need to go to a ticket counter pre-flight and be weighed would be massive.  It adds an enormous amount of time to each customer transaction (you try getting a small child up on the scale to stay still), and makes many customers go to the counter who would have avoided it entirely beforehand.  This means you need more counters (which are expensive to rent) and more staff.  It would completely ruin every program to get people to print boarding passes at home, and business travelers especially would hate the enormous lines and defect to any airline which wasn't making them go through that hassle.

Putting the scales at the gate would be even worse, since it would add an incredibly long time to boarding to weigh everyone and negotiate charging them for their weight (what if the card is declined, or they raise a fuss, or they're mobility impaired and in a wheelchair which won't be flying with them?)  And you're doing this while the plane is idling on the tarmac, delaying it from taking off, which is a *huge* cost.So I can see why this is a tough needle to thread.  I think you could possibly add something like the following as a rule clarification in your wiki:

* If the thing where the person is out of the loop is a controversy or dispute, top level comments must contain a neutral description of all major sides of the controversy/dispute.  If you only describe the perspective of one side, you are not giving an answer to someone who is out of the loop in respect to the controversy, because they only got half an answer.

I am sort of basing this on how we use Rule 1 over at /r/changemyview where the rule is concrete as to what content your comment must include (in our case, some rebuttal to something OP said), which makes it clear where the line is.Sorry huadpe, your submission has been removed:

Indeed, it seems quite clear that they are *not* lies.  They're False, but that's a very different thing from being a lie.

A lie is when you say something that you know to be False.  If you believe something to be True but are wrong, that's much different from a lie.

This matters because in the law, there is a principle known as mens rea, or guilty mind.  To punish someone under the law for all but the most trivial offenses, the government needs to prove that they knowingly did a bad act.  In this case, the bad act you're pointing to is saying False and derogatory things about various groups.

But in every example we've discussed, there's no doubt that the people saying these terrible things genuinely do believe them to be True.  They are not knowingly stating Falsehoods, because they believe the statements True.  They honestly and truly believe that homosexuals are more likely to have disease or be pedophiles.

Because they're honest beliefs, they do not meet the standard of knowingly making False statements.  This is what I was getting at before when I was talking about the "actual malice" standard US courts apply to defamation claims relating to public figures.  

What you're proposing is to essentially make publicly disagreeing with the government's position on a question of fact about certain groups and topics illegal.  I'm not OK with that.

As a final point, I will note that bullying someone into suicide for any reason is illegal.  It's at least criminal harassment, and at most manslaughter.Sorry efreererun, your submission has been removed:

A key purpose of the 14th amendment was to base districts on population whether or not the residents could vote. For instance women (who couldn't yet vote) were still counted, even though large portions of the West had heavily male populations and would have benefitted from extra representation if only eligible voters were counted. The main thing I see is if someone has the need to use such a vehicle on a regular basis, it's very costly to need a second car for all their other driving. If we accept that sometimes you need a pickup truck, you're left with owning two cars, renting a pickup every time you need one, or just driving a pickup everywhere. Can you agree that for many people who don't have that use case, the current bottle is better though?  If you do want a larger amount of ketchup to come out, the current design does it neatly and without gunk buildup.  If you want the classic design that bottle is available too.

This bottle is designed for the common use case of "I want a lot of ketchup."  You don't seem to have this use case often, but many if not most people want a lot of ketchup.This makes sense for things which are much fancier than what I have in mind when I think ketchup.  Things which involve putting ketchup on them are generally not fancy canapes where you'd portion out the right proportion of sauce for each little perfect bite.  Ketchup is for french fries where you just serve a big plate and let people go at them.Unless you own the animal as your private property, you're not allowed to go out and kill it.  If you go to a government owned park and shoot an a deer without the government's permission you can justifiably be prosecuted.

Setting seasons and caps and other restrictions as to the hunting of animals on government land at least seems totally legitimate, much in the same way I can't go chop down trees in the park and take the wood with me.I think it is still a good thing to do as long as we would expect someone with that condition to have a positive life overall, even if not as good as an average life.

It shouldn't matter whether the relative quality of life will be high, but rather what the absolute quality of life will be.  Especially in a wealthy western country where they will generally be able to get appropriate care and support, it seems likely that most children born with disabilities will have lives worth living.Sorry alayne_, your submission has been removed:

Canada's law is for instance much more permissive than the United Kingdom's.  There are even variations within Canada providing exceptions from some regulations for firearms in remote wilderness areas.  This is because if you're in the deep woods, bears are a very real danger and you should probably be carrying a shotgun.It is also worth pointing out that the government can't make simple possession of a firearm a felony like that, because [a very similar case has decided that scienter is a necessary element of such crimes.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9070596919144743522&amp;q=scienter+felony&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33)

&gt;I don't know how to reply to this comment with anything other than saying I disagree.

Realistically, in the United States, any armed rebellion would have to include substantial defections from the military.  Considering how interwoven the military is into society it isn't totally implausible that could happen if the situation were in fact ripe for rebellion, which it definitely is not right now.

The US military though as it stands is absurdly powerful, and could easily suppress an armed insurrection if it remained cohesive. The US military is very, very good at fighting wars, and would utterly crush a patchwork rebellion.

So in a sense, they are right, it doesn't matter what weapons civilians have, because there's no level of armed population in the US that could defeat the US military.I see one benefit of the electoral college in forcing candidates to target more median voters, rather than trying to run up the score among their more fervent supporters.  

This is something you see a lot in systems which use proportional representation as opposed to first past the post, where parties essentially don't need to cater to all voters, but can get enough support among particular factions to get the seats they want.

The electoral college means that the biggest gains come from targeting the middle though, and that's actually a healthy thing for a republic.

The thing I think that is critical here is that (to me) the selection of a President isn't just about finding the True expression of the popular will.  It is about having the structure that produces good governance and respect from the people of the legitimacy of that governance, even when it does something they dislike.Adopting the Westminster system would be a much, *much* more radical change in American governance than abolishing the electoral college.  You would be abolishing the system of checks and balances which makes the US system what it is.

The Westminster system is not a proposal for altering selecting the President, it would be a wholesale re-write of the US constitution.I have three critical points to make:

* **You are looking at the debts the US government owes while ignoring the assets it owns.**

You say that the US government can't tax enough to manage its debt, but you are ignoring the fact that the US government owns an absurd stockpile of assets, and almost certainly has a positive net worth.

The biggest asset class is land.  [The US government owns an absurd amount of land.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_lands)  Obviously not all of the land has a very high market value, but there's still a lot of value there.  We're talking a full quarter of the entire land area of the US.  And the courts have held that the Government can do whatever it wants with the land, including sell it or mortgage it.  If the US couldn't get good rates on refinancing its bonds, it could quite easily pledge some federal land to essentially issue mortgage bonds, which wouldn't even require selling the land.

There's also [over $300 billion of gold in Fort Knox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository) that's just sitting there.  

The US Government is also owed a bunch of money from people who have taken out student loans, and owns some other financial assets which are reasonably easily marketable, [around $2 trillion worth in total.](http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/commentaries/Federal-Government-Assets-and-Student-Loans.php)

The government could quite easily market asset backed securities to keep rates under control if needed.  And because major investors in T-bills know the assets are there, it isn't really needed.

* **The US Government has locked in low rates.**

[The US currently has astoundingly low rates on T-bills,](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield) and much of the current Federal debt [has been refinanced onto long-term debt, especially 10 and 30 year T-bills.](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/10/16/2004102/the-real-reasons-why-the-us-treasurys-debt-maturity-has-been-rising/)  Those bonds have locked in low rates, and so a rise in rates due to market demands would not have as much of the catastrophic effect as you're proposing.

* **The Fed is keenly aware of the high volume of monetary base outstanding and they aren't idiots.**

The Fed is actually very good at their job, and is perfectly capable of reining in inflation, [and has caused recessions to do so in the past.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession)  That reputation is actually well deserved, and the Fed has sufficient assets on its books to sanitize enormous amounts of monetary base if it so chooses.  So there's no reason that a rising money multiplier must result in massive inflation.  The Fed can just destroy monetary base to keep things in line.  On this graph, [the blue line represents the assets the Fed has on hand which can be sold to reduce monetary base.](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=2OgE)

The Fed has a ton of dry inflation-fighting powder, and will use it if needed.&gt;the populous being armed never helps tyranny.

I am saying that a highly armed populace can enforce extra-governmental tyrannical force upon disfavored or dissenting members of the population, and for many decades did so in the US south.

I was responding to the idea that the arming of the populous never helps tyranny, and am saying that mobs can be tyrannical.The electoral college blocks off the maximum you can gain in any given state.  So a Republican getting 60% in Texas gets nothing more than one getting 55% there.  What this means is that it reduces the returns to parties for running up big margins in their base areas.  Instead, you end up fighting your battles in the states which are closest to the median, and to win a diverse set of close-to-median states you need to hew pretty close to the center.  

It also prevents regional parties from being successful, which is a good thing.  No matter how much vote you get in the northeast, a candidate on a northeast-only ticket cannot possibly win.  Same for a southern-only ticket like George Wallace in 1968.Gerrymandering refers to the re-drawing of electoral districts for partisan advantage, but the electoral college is apportioned by state, and state borders do not get re-drawn.  The only aspect of the Federal government directly impacted by gerrymandering is the House of Representatives.&gt;Well they do own an enormis amount of assets, but their liabilities are far larger. According to the Debt Clock unfunded liabilities are over 100 trillion dollars and counting. 

This is a laughably absurd number and is someone using statistics to lie through their teeth.  Saying the US has "unfunded liabilities" which amount to 250x the current budget deficit is simply not plausible.

&gt;The government already uses BLM land as collateral for its debt,

This isn't True.

&gt;but that land does not represent a liquid asset meaning that it will not help the government pay the ever growing amount of interest that they owe.

If used as collateral it can prevent rates from rising due to a risk premium, which is what you're worried about happening and causing a debt crisis.  As long as US government debt continues to not pay a risk premium, persistent deficits are sustainable.

&gt;This simply means that the government has promised to pay a certain amount of interest for T-Bills to its lenders. This is actually worse for the government in the long run because it represents less revenue while the government faces ever increasing need to pay large amounts of interest.

I don't understand what you mean here.  How does spending less on interest mean less revenue to the treasury?

&gt;The fact that interest on the debt is the 5th largest budget item is ridiculous in its self and if the government has the ability to lower the debt they need to do it now because this is an extremely inefficient system.

Debt service is a pretty large chunk of most government, household and corporation budgets.  Debt service being the #5 
item isn't concerning to me.

&gt;I would point out that the FED "causing a rescission" to rain in inflation achieves nothing except for delaying the inevitable because all of that toxic debt is absorbed by the U.S. government anyway.

Why is it inevitable?  You're saying the (unspecified) debt is "toxic" but you bear the burden of specifying what debt you're talking about and why it is in fact "toxic."  If you're talking about the mortgage backed securities which were the big blowup in 2008, it's worth noting that those assets [are in fact turning a profit for the Fed.](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-federal-reserve-profit-20150109-story.html)  

&gt;If the FED destroys the monetary base it will trigger a depression because the market is currently dependent on constant inflation in order for the GDP to continue growing each year.

You realize I'm talking about destroying monetary base in order to stave off rising inflation, which includes rising asset prices for things like t-bills?  If inflation were falling, then the fed wouldn't need to remove monetary base.Sunk cost I think is the one you're looking for.&gt;Is essence, the rejection of liberalism is a voluntary decision, for which the state - which has ownership of the territory the act is performed on - can choose to withdraw its offers of protection for individuals who are, in essence, refusing the Social Contract (for which citizenship and its rights are a manifestation of), or otherwise deny them access to a platform.

To be clear, you're proposing that the government withdraw the protection of government against extralegal violence from people based on their viewpoints?The point is though that the child is still a positive value.  It isn't cruel to let them be born, which is the point I was making.&gt;Doesn't that also create a True-Conservative bias? Those who want to make significant changes in either direction are hampered... which is great if you're a conservative by nature, but less great if you're liberal.

Yes it does.  though I think the distinction here is really between small-c conservatism and radicalism.  That is, the Constitution fosters a decent amount of bias towards remaining in the status quo.

 There are both right wing radicals, and left wing radicals, and the US system of government is designed not to let radicalism get a strong foot in.  I don't think you can say that it is inherently unfair to either right or left wing activists in favor of the other.

I think that's a proper thing for a Constitution to do.  A Constitution is not an entirely neutral document, and can have the express purpose of fostering a certain type of government and a certain path for that government.  The necessities of governance mean there need to be a wide range of choices within that path, but the Constitution should provide some safeguards against major deviations.

This is what I was saying about a Constitution not just representing popular will, but also having the goal of fostering good governance.  Frequent, radical policy shifts are bad governance.

States which are very likely to be able to be tipped one way or another get disproportionate attention.  So for instance Wyoming is the most overrepresented state in the electoral college because it has a very small population, but still 3 electoral votes (the bare minimum).  But nobody campaigns there because it is going to vote Republican.

Ohio gets attention because it often wavers back and forth between the parties.  Ohio is winnable by either Democrats or Republicans, and attracting a median Ohio voter to your side meaningfully increases your chances of winning the Presidency.&gt;Yet the electoral college makes us perhaps the most ponderous modern country.

It's not the electoral college doing that, it's the system of checks and balances.  Most other western nations are unitary governments where the executive and legislature are not separate branches, and the leader of the legislature is the nation's leader.  The US separates powers and has each branch check the other, which is unusual.  To make the US less ponderous in the way you're taking about would be itself a very radical change in the basic structure of US government.

There's a debate to be had about whether such a change should be made, but it's got very little to do with the electoral college; you're talking about radically altering the presidency itself.Counties are arbitrary creatures of the state government and can have their borders manipulated at will.  Their population also varies hugely.  At the extreme end, Los Angeles County, CA has a population greater than ~~41~~ 43 states.&gt;The current state-by-state winner-take-all system encourages regional candidates. A third-party candidate has 51 separate opportunities to shop around for states that he or she can win or affect the results. Minor-party candidates have significantly affected the outcome in six (40%) of the 15 presidential elections in the past 67 years (namely the 1948, 1968, 1980, 1992, 1996, and 2000 presidential elections). Candidates such as John Anderson (1980), Ross Perot (1992 and 1996), and Ralph Nader (2000) did not win a plurality of the popular vote in any state, but managed to affect the outcome by switching electoral votes in numerous particular states. Extremist candidacies as Strom Thurmond and George Wallace won a substantial number of electoral votes in numerous states.

I don't see how the EC encourages third party or regional candidates.  In fact, it seems to discourage them in as much as they can't win or even come close to winning.

There's a lot of desire for more than two choices because US politics is multipolar, but I don't think you've made a case that the EC changed incentives in those elections in a way that a popular vote wouldn't.

As to the amount of attention paid by candidates, I don't see why it's that important and it seems to be a bit arbitrary the metrics you proposed.  Especially the one about disaster declarations, which mostly seems to be about Florida and hurricanes.

&gt;Most Americans don't ultimately care whether their presidential candidate wins or loses in their state or district . . . they care whether he/she wins the White House. Voters want to know, that even if they were on the losing side, their vote actually was equally counted and mattered to their candidate. Most Americans think it is wrong that the candidate with the most popular votes can lose. We don't allow this in any other election in our representative republic.

Sure we do.  In 2012 more Americans voted for a Democrat for the House than a Republican, but Republicans controlled the House.

Eh, the EC isn't great, and if I were hanging out with Hamilton and Madison spitballing ideas, I wouldn't propose it.  But given that there could be many worse systems, and that changing the Constitution is both hard and a very big deal, I don't necessarily think we should abolish it.&gt;First: In the case of no presidential candidate receiving a majority of the electoral votes, the election is decided by the House of Representatives. And that, as you noted, is affected by gerrymandering, and thus the presidency can also be so affected under the right conditions (which admittedly have not occurred in over 100 years).

In the special choosing-the-President vote (called a contingent election), each state's house delegation votes as a bloc though.  Gerrymandering might impact that, but it's significantly attenuated by the one-state-one-vote system.

That said, the contingent election system in the House is profoundly stupid, and even if not ditching the whole EC, there's a good case for reforming contingent elections to be less dumb.  This is in the category of "ideas that were dumb in 1789 and are still dumb today."

&gt;Second: Currently two states (Nebraska and Maine) divide their electoral votes along congressional district boundaries, with the remaining two electoral votes going to the winner of the state-wide popular vote. This allows gerrymandering of the congressional districts to directly affect the outcome of the presidential election. NE and ME are very small, so gerrymandering in those states does not affect the presidential election much, but if other (larger) states were to adopt their method, the impact could be much greater.

Thanks, and we hope you understand!So Canada and Mexico should totally trash their economies and subject themselves to 20%+ unemployment over guns?

Canada for instance [exports about 350 billion US dollars of goods a year to the US,](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c1220.html) which constitutes about [17% of Canada's about 1.8 trillion USD economy.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/canada/gdp)

A 17% fall in Canada's economy would be totally devastating on a great depression sort of scale.  Trade isn't a drain on their real economy.  Canadians get goods and services they couldn't otherwise easily get (like fresh California vegetables in the winter) from the US, and the US gets goods it couldn't otherwise easily get (like gobs of Canadian oil or maple syrup).  Both sides are better off from the trade.  The Canadian imports lost would be a drain on the US' GDP and a drain on Canadians' real wellbeing.In that structure, you'd probably see states making a lot more counties via subdivision, and then leaving them be.  You're incentivizing states to have a lot of counties by giving some bonus to the fact that it's a county.  So LA for instance is all within one county, whereas NYC is within 5 counties.  That structure would incent California to break LA County up into multiple smaller counties.So we're extremely clear then, if someone says (for instance) that Muslims should not have the right to freedom of religion, I can shoot them in the head and face no legal consequences?&gt;Depending on how loosely you define government and what exactly you mean by "need".

Not really.  "If not X you will very likely die" is a pretty tight definition of needing X, and it's pretty uncontroversial that without government at any level, the majority of living humans would probably die.  Well, they'd make new government before they died, but if they couldn't for some arbitrary reason, then death.This was really interesting.  I had not known about the strategic importance of the Sudatenland and had always been sort of off the Chamberlain bashing bandwagon, but this provides some pretty good counter-evidence.  

\u2206So because someone interrupts a speech, I can shoot them in the head and be totally justified legally?

I find that highly objectionable.&gt;The gun grabbers, including Her Majesty Queen Hillary, like to say "30k people are killed due to gun violence each year". That is being dishonest. That number includes suicides which account for 2/3 of all gun deaths.

Why is it dishonest to include suicides, or use government policy to try to prevent suicide?  Government currently does a lot of things both on a voluntary basis (suicide hotlines) and involuntary basis (involuntary civil commitment) to prevent suicide.

Suicide is terrible and it doesn't seem that strange to me that we might consider reducing the suicide rate to be a valid goal of government policy.&gt;So why is it your decision to prevent someone form taking their own life?

The government has already made this their position, with laws which allow them to forcibly restrain you if you are a danger to yourself or others.  In as much as you're not calling for the abolition of involuntary commitment to mental health facilities, I don't think this holds water.

If we accept that preventing suicide is a valid goal of the government the question then becomes to what extent can liberty be constrained towards that end.

I think for instance Canada has done a pretty good job of striking a balance here that substantially reduces gun suicide and homicide rates, while still allowing a large amount of firearm ownership for sporting and home defense purposes.  Guns are not banned in Canada, though some classes of firearms are much more difficult to get than others.

When a crazy person wanted to do a mass shooting in Canada's Parliament, he was only able to obtain a [Winchester model 1894 shotgun,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_shootings_at_Parliament_Hill,_Ottawa) because handguns and such are much more difficult to obtain in Canada.

You can of course disagree about the balance that is to be struck, and good faith disagreement is fine.  But it doesn't make people disingenuous or acting with bad faith.  &gt;Well, quite simply, if they don't want to be liable for their own protection, they shouldn't interrupt someone's speech.

This is an absurd position. We do not subject people to the death penalty for trespassing, which is what you're talking about.

It is perfectly permissible for the state to forcibly remove them from the venue for trespassing, and maybe give them a small fine.  Allowing that they can be killed extrajudicially is an absurd overreaction.

&gt;If we're borrowing on the idea that we're placing them in some sort of libertarian position, perhaps we could borrow the Non-Aggression principle. Additionally, there's the question, is life a liberty?

Life is a distinctly protected right under the law.  For example, the US Constitution's Due Process Clause states that "nor shall any person ... deprived of life liberty or property without due process of the law."

This also is protected by Magna Carta in the UK, and is in fact one of the three clauses of Magna Carta which are still in force in UK law today.

&gt;No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.

Your proposal goes after the very heart of the rights which make liberal democracies what they are.

Under a liberal government, it is the role of the state, not vigilantes, to enforce the law, and to do so within the bounds of a pre-written code, applied equally towards all.

&gt;Certainly, it's a human right to say, binge-drink alcohol. Or eat a pound of bacon each day. Or bungee-jump. What about thrill-seeking behaviors? Aren't these literally just about teasing death?

These aren't human rights.  They're things you're generally allowed to do, but that does not make them human rights.

I cannot for instance buy lawn darts in the US, because the government banned them as being unsafe.  I also can't buy expired milk, or drugs which are not FDA approved.  I also cannot modify my car to emit tons of smoke or be very loud.

The government has reasonably broad power to regulate for public safety, and while there are arguments those regulations should not encompass as much at they do, it is not the same as saying they violate human rights.

Further, we do allow that basic rights can be violated for good reason, and being suicidal has been accepted as one such reason.  For instance, the government can forcibly detain you if they can show a court that you are likely a danger to yourself or others.  Forcible detention *is* a violation of your human rights.  But we allow it because it is done for a good reason and you are given due process (the court hearing).We allow the government to involuntarily commit suicidal people to mental hospitals.  Are you saying we should not do this?Do you actually have evidence that Hillary Clinton said the words you put in quotation marks attributed to her?  I had assumed the article linked below it had used the quote, but it does not.

If you're going to accuse someone of being dishonest, and put words in quotes with their name, you need to show it is in fact a quote.

Ok, I think we disagree at a pretty fundamental level about the role of government then, and probably can't come to an agreement.Their $350 a year plan has a $1.1 million cap.  That's woefully insufficient for a school district.  Wrongful death of multiple children is going to be a $10 million + lawsuit.  And dead children / grieving parents are *extremely* sympathetic plaintiffs who will get enormous jury awards.

The article /u/cacheflow quoted at the start of this chain said commercial insurers were quoting more like $2500/teacher/yr.&gt;The Canadian government also isnt bombing every other country on earth so they are more trustworthy.

[They are bombing ISIS,](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/canadian-jets-continue-to-bomb-islamic-state-after-trudeaus-election-win/article27235454/) and more generally Canada hews very close to the US on most foreign policy matters.  And there have been some instances of radical islamist individual terrorists in Canada, such as [this guy who rammed his car into two Canadian Forces soldiers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu_ramming_attack)

&gt;They also do not have anything that comes close to the magnitude of the second amendment in the US constitution.

This is True, the Canadian constitution does not protect the right to bear arms.  But I don't see how this means Canadian policy is bad policy, or how it means that American gun control advocates are being dishonest.I wasn't the person you were replying to initially there.  I was replying because I thought your use of the term human rights was incorrect and misleading.How is that at all relevant to whether or not people in the US are lying?You're using the word profiling to mean something very different from what other people mean when they use that word.

Profiling is about looking for attributes in a generic fashion which the police believe are generally associated with criminality.  Anything where you have specific information about a suspected criminal is not profiling, because it's not looking at a profile of the type of person the police expect to be criminal, but based on actual evidence of actual criminality.

So for instance, if a witness to a crime says the crime was committed by a black man who drove away in a silver escalade east on the highway, pulling over a black man in a silver escalade going east on the highway isn't profiling; there's probable cause to believe he may be involved in the crime.

On the other hand, thinking that black men in fancy cars are likely criminals and pulling them over to rummage around for drugs *is* profiling, because it is based just on a generic profile of who the cops think criminals are, not specific evidence of a crime.

In both cases, a black man in an escalade gets pulled over, but one is profiling, and one is not.&gt;I haven't done any CRA-based work so I'm not going to comment too specifically, but my guess is that any recovery there is pretty specific and a general grievance of racial profiling wouldn't meet any statutory bar to prevail on such a claim.

Actually, it's a bit the opposite of this, and generally claims against municipalities, as opposed to officers in their individual capacities, need to prove a policy, pattern, or practice of discrimination, so often there is a court battle relating to proving such a pattern, which could fairly be described as a general grievance.[42 USC 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) is the relevant statute.  It reads:

So for your formulation of: "You can sue the police for anything they do to you so long as you show A, B and C" 

I think it can be met, in as much as you can show:

* A. It violates some legal or constitutional right of yours; and

* B. It was done under color of law; and

* C. They aren't a judge (with narrow exceptions).

The CRA is incredibly broad as to what is actionable, literally any violation of any constitutional or legal right.  The fight in 1983 suits usually revolve around whether the thing violates some right, whether the government officers involved enjoy qualified immunity (which is entirely a creation of federal common law), and whether damages exist.

In as much as any statute can allow suing the government for a general grievance, I think the Civil Rights Act does so.  It is a broad and comprehensive cause of action for violations of the rights of the people.Ok, so I think I see what you're after now, you want to compensate all persons arrested and not charged for their time, regardless of why they were arrested; is that accurate?Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

In reply to /u/pepperonifire you said:

&gt;Moreover, my view is not superceding the Civil Rights Acts. The ability of suspects to sue for unnecessary roughness or police brutality does not magically disappear when the police are required to pay suspects for their time.

I want to make clear that being wrongfully arrested is itself something you can sue for under the Civil Rights Act.  See, for instance, [this case](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16278153923643522764&amp;q=1983+arrest&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,31) allowing a lawsuit against the City of Philadelphia to proceed on the sole claim of a False arrest.  Quoting from the court:

&gt;Clearly, an arrest without probable cause is a constitutional violation actionable under \u00a7 1983.

[\u00a7 1983 is the relevant provision of the Civil Rights Act.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983)

You can't allow unconstitutional profiling arrests and still say you haven't changed the Civil Rights Act.  If this compensation allows profiling-based arrests to take place without the threat of a Civil Rights Act suit, then it is superseding the Civil Rights Act.Would you change your view if I could show this policy is unconstitutional?  I can make that case, but it will take me a while and require citing a lot of sources, so I want to clarify up front that if I can convince you this policy would be unconstitutional, you'd no longer support it.

If the answer to this is "no" by the way, I want to clarify if you would want to:

1. Amend the constitution to make this constitutional; or

2. Ignore the constitution and have the government openly violate the orders of federal courts.I am aware of the area of law into which I am treading.  There is caselaw that discrimination on suspect classification for otherwise admissible persons is not permissible, and for certain family-class immigrants (particularly spouses of US citizens) there is an affirmative right to immigrate which the government has to overcome if you bring a challenge in court.OP said they'd find it convincing if I can make my case, so see my pending reply to them.

Edit:  [it is now here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3vun7i/cmv_a_temporary_ban_on_muslim_immigration_is_a/cxqvr85.)

As an addendum, I will note that this will be an extraordinarily unusual case in that the Congress hasn't written this openly discriminatory a statute since roughly the Chinese Exclusion Act (partially invalidated in US v. Wong Kim Ark).  So while the Trump DOJ might have a colorable case under present law to overcome what I've said there, it seems extremely likely to me that by going so far off the deep end, it would cause the Supreme Court to set a new bar for such cases, since there really isn't any caselaw on a directly and openly discriminatory Federal law like this.So, immigration law is an area where the US government has pretty broad discretion, but it is not totally unlimited.

In the first instance, in certain circumstances, immigrants do have standing to bring cases in US courts to challenge decisions of these types.  See, for instance, [INS v. Chadha, 462 US 919 Supreme Court (1983).](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=immigration+constitution&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33&amp;case=2221871582286121199&amp;scilh=0)  Since this is an incredibly broad prohibition, it is a near certainty that some immigrant with standing to challenge the law will exist, even if most potential immigrants would not have standing.  For instance, a lawful permanent resident of the United States generally has a right to due process if denied re-entry into the United States.  See, for instance, [Freeman v. Gonzales, 444 F. 3d 1031 9th Cir (2006).](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33&amp;case=6082112015812470178&amp;scilh=0)

Second, once we get to a hearing, the government will be in the position of defending "is a muslim" as a standalone criterion for categorically excluding someone otherwise admissible (such as a green card holder returning from abroad) into the United States.

This is an unenviable position.  Laws which discriminate on the basis of religion are held to the exact same legal standard as race and ethnicity, all of which are considered "suspect" classifications.  These classifications are subject to the most exacting levels of scrutiny, called strict scrutiny.  To be permissible the regulation must meet a three part test.

* It must seek to further a compelling government interest.  That is, it must be seeking to advance something the government more or less has to do.  Preventing mass death or terrorism is a compelling interest, so it will probably pass this prong.

* It must be the least restrictive means.  In the circumstances of immigration, you will likely also pass this prong, since there is really not much way to stop potential terrorists once in the USA until they actually commit a criminal act.

* It must be narrowly tailored.  *This* is where your problems lie.  This policy is the opposite of narrow tailoring.  It is taking an extraordinarily large group of people (roughly 1 in 7 humans) and putting them all in the same boat just because of their religion.  That is the antithesis of narrow tailoring.  If the government had any specific reason to believe that any particular applicant was a member of ISIS they could certainly exclude them, as that would be narrowly tailored.  But wholesale excluding all Muslims is never gonna pass this prong.  For just one example, it excludes Shiite muslims, even though ISIS is a profoundly Sunni organization and there's basically no way a Shiite Muslim would be associated with ISIS, because ISIS fucking hates Shiites.

For an example of how courts have treated much less religion-based restrictions in other areas of law, I'd point you to [Sherbert v. Verner, 374 US 398 Supreme Court (1963)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33&amp;case=17526177081953259048&amp;scilh=0)

&gt;Here not only is it apparent that appellant's declared ineligibility for benefits derives solely from the practice of her religion, but the pressure upon her to forego that practice is unmistakable. The ruling forces her to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand. Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her Saturday worship.

&gt;Nor may the South Carolina court's construction of the statute be saved from constitutional infirmity on the ground that unemployment compensation benefits are not appellant's "right" but merely a "privilege." It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege. . . . [T]o condition the availability of benefits upon this appellant's willingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her constitutional liberties.Sorry Libertarian__gamer, your comment has been removed:

Regarding your first point, I would concur that anyone with standing (e.g. re-entering citizen or green card holder) should be excluded. Essentially the ban would be on all net new Muslim immigration.

You understand this doesn't make the law not unconstitutional, it is essentially a tool by which you're shielding the law from ever being reviewed by the courts.  Are you really comfortable with the idea of the government doing an end-around of the Constitution by just enforcing the law against people the government has declared can't sue it?

Should we also repeal other laws like [the Civil Rights Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) which confer standing to sue for violations of rights?

&gt;To your example, Sunni's are 90% of the Muslim population, and 100% of ISIS. If ISIS was Shiite, then the argument that the law would be too broad makes sense.

First, it's clear that a less restrictive category (Sunni Muslims) accomplishes the exact same goals as the broader category (all Muslims).  If a narrower category accomplishes the same goal as a broader category, then you fail narrow tailoring.

Second, the law is not narrowly tailored because even within the more restrictive category of Sunni Muslims, the large, large majority are not potential terrorists.  When a law subject to strict scrutiny encompasses mostly people who have done nothing wrong and should not be subject to the restriction, the law fails strict scrutiny.  To pass, all or nearly all the persons impacted by the law must be of the sort which is legitimately targeted (ISIS affiliated persons).

  The quote you gave was about prong 2, the least restrictive means clause, which I ceded.  I don't think that source is very good by the way.  The [Wikipedia entry on strict scrutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny) is actually quite clear and perfectly serviceable for our purposes.

&gt;the Court has rejected challenges under the Free Exercise Clause to governmental regulation of certain overt acts prompted by religious beliefs or principles [...] The conduct or actions so regulated have invariably posed some substantial threat to public safety, peace or order.

There's almost no conduct in play here at all, let alone conduct which "pose[s] some substantial threat to public safety, peace, or order."  This law bans you for the fact of being Muslim, regardless of your conduct.  The only conduct in question is whether you pray to a god and what you call that god.  If it were related to terroristic or associational conduct, the regulation would be totally legitimate (and indeed, that's already a rule).

But this law is not about terrorist conduct, it's about religious conduct.  The only association with terrorist conduct is that a very small minority of people who follow that religion happen to be terrorists.  But given that freedom of religion is a thing, that's simply not sufficient.

Thanks for the kind words and the delta.

I do want to qualify a little and note that an openly discriminating federal statute like this is virtually untested in modern American law.  The Federal government has not passed any laws which explicitly discriminate based on protected class in the era of modern interpretations of Constitutional rights starting in the 1950s.  State statutes have been tested (and universally found unconstitutional).  But never federal, and never in an area of extreme deference like immigration.

In one sense that adds a little unpredictability to this question, since there aren't super-close precedents for this sort of thing.

But I think from a view of the judicial system that takes the judges' political and historical awareness into account, it makes the case for upholding this law much harder.  John Roberts in particular seems keenly aware of his place in history and I simply cannot see him letting a law like this get upheld on the merits.  It would be a second *Korematsu,* the kind of decision that defines the court for a generation and seriously erodes the long-term respectability of the judicial system.  They might toss a particular case on something more technical like standing, but if they let it get to the merits, I just can't see the court upholding this.  It would be a body blow to the American judiciary in the long run.I don't think finding someone with standing will be too hard for an organization like the ACLU (who will vet their test case plaintiffs within an inch of their life).  This is such a broad rule that it's much easier than normal to have a good plaintiff.

Those classes might be where it comes from, or possibly another similar class.&gt;Clearly the matter is complicated by LPRs outside of the country who might not be allowed to re-enter. Assuming that is not the case, however, and it only applies to Muslims who have never been granted admission looking to immigrate, how could the Court even consider the case to the extent where it could judge narrow tailoring?

There are a few narrow categories of aliens where current law requires that certain aliens be admitted, specifically looking at asylum claimants under [8 USC 1231(b)(3)(A),](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1231) which is a "may not remove" provision.

8 USC 1231(b)(3)(C) provides that a trier of fact shall decide such claims, and I simply cannot see a federal court allowing a trier of fact to have a trial where the question is "are you a muslim?" and the answer to that question alone determines if you can stay in the US even if otherwise eligible, even if that trier of fact is an administrative law judge.

Further, the broadest category of exception, in sec. 1231(b)(3)(B)(iv) still requires that the AG have "reasonable grounds to believe that the alien is a danger to the security of the United States."  That the alien is a muslim is not gonna be reasonable grounds as a matter of law.   And the Supreme Court has weighed in substantively on cases like this for asylum claimants in the past, such as in [INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 US 421 Supreme Court (1987).](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8382431444026854396&amp;)

I think it will really just take one claimant who has standing.  Whether that's a LPR, citizen, asylum claimant, or someone else, I can't see the Supreme Court letting a law like this stand.

For an alternate avenue to a test case, I could see a State Dept. or DHS employee refusing to enforce this provision, being fired, and making a wrongful termination case out of it, claiming that the government can't compel her to enforce an unconstitutional law as a condition of employment.  Of course coached along the way by the ACLU or whomever to be an ideal test case.

This case will be unusual in as much as Congress hasn't passed a law this openly discriminatory since approximately the Chinese Exclusion Act.  There's not an on-point precedent, because Congress has never gone this crazy.

I think from a view of the courts, especially the Supreme Court, as entities which are aware of politics and history, there's a much stronger case than usual for a law like this being overturned.  Upholding this on the merits (which a political question ruling would essentially do) would be seen by history as a second *Korematsu.*  To let open and flagrant religious discrimination take place under the color of American law and with the implicit stamp of approval from the Supreme Court would be profoundly damaging to the Court in the long run.  That will factor into any decision of the court, and I don't think it bodes well for a law like this.

I admit I was making a fairly one sided argument (this being CMV after all, and my goal being to change the OP's view), and am certainly open to the idea that I could be wrong.  This is certainly an untested area since I don't think Congress has been this discriminatory in at least a century.  

I do think my case is at least plausible though.&gt;My problem still is that, in Cardozo-Fonseca (and several other removal cases) the Court uses "intent of Congress" as its paramount guide. They can interpret those laws, and in some cases overturn executive action inconsistent with Congressional intent, but intent of Congress has always been the key. In the hypothetical, we're assuming Congress has made its intent to ban people for their religion clear.

But *Chada* does stand for the proposition that intent of Congress is not the sole thing going on.  Congress cannot for instance foist an unconstitutional structure onto such proceedings, even where such a structure is fully intended.  A trial to determine someone's religion and then punish them for being that religion is so batshit crazy in the American legal system that I just can't see them let it stand.

&gt;The point about a second Korematsu is well taken though. No doubt the Court cares about itself as an institution and about American ideals generally, and can sometimes bend pure legal analysis to protect that.

It's not just bending though, as I point out, this sort of open discrimination is almost literally unprecedented.  It's not an unreasonable stretch for the courts to formulate a new rule in response to a type of law which hasn't been seen before.  And I can't imagine such a new rule being favorable to the government.Sorry mushybees, your comment has been removed:

[It is here.](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration)

First, this is something nobody asked him for, nor is it off the cuff.  This is a considered statement with the opportunity to edit and choose words carefully.

&gt;Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.

Trump is calling for the government to openly and explicitly discriminate on the basis of religion.  That's bigoted in its own right.  Calling for the government to single out a religious group for discrimination is bigotry.  Considering the extreme correlation between race and religion in this context, it is also effectively racist, since it would basically bar almost all persons of Arab descent from the United States.

Further, Trump has defended this position by referring to [FDR's racist policies relating to Japanese and German people in WWII.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/us/politics/donald-trump-muslims.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0)

People are calling Donald Trump racist because he is proposing the government treat different racial and religions groups differently, and his reaction to being asked about that is to cite other instances of racism by the US government approvingly.&gt;Nothing he's proposed has been unreasonable.

Do you consider the US banning otherwise admissible persons solely because of their race or religion to be unreasonable?Religion is protected to the same extent as race in US law.  You don't need to get into disparate impact analysis for the purpose of law.  Both are subject to strict scrutiny.So you consider persons of a particular religion or race to be much more dangerous than persons of other races?

If so, then I would say you hold a racist viewpoint.

If not, then are you for banning all immigration from anywhere?&gt;If you think Ice Cube's son would make for a better actor in the NWA movie than Tom Cruise based on his skin tone. I'd say that's a racist viewpoint too.

The US isn't a movie, and we aren't hiring people to portray others of a certain race.



&gt;You need to make the case that it's unreasonable. They're not being banned because of their religion or race. They're being banned because of their terrorist activities and radical ideologies.

This is False.  Having engaged in terrorist activities or associated with radical ideologies is grounds to prohibit entry into the US already.  The difference here is that Trump wants to ban *all* muslims, even those who have not engaged in terrorist activities or radical ideologies.

It **explicitly** is banning people because of their religion.  Trump says so in black and white.&gt;A little misleading. Religion is offered more protections (tax-exemption being the biggest), but only to a point. That point is still "the law", no matter the race or religion, because the law doesn't distinguish race or religion. The law is still above religion in this country.

Not really, the NAACP is just as tax exempt as the Catholic Church.  Religion just tends to be more defined by organization than race, which tends to be more individually defined.  But religious people aren't tax exempt, and black people aren't tax exempt.

&gt;That being said, violent religion isn't historically tolerated by America. See Waco and the Branch Davidians. You can argue they were non-violent, but there was a standoff and they did have stockpiled weapons. Says violent to me. 

Violence isn't tolerated in American law for any reason, religious or otherwise.  Racially motivated violence is just as illegal as religiously motivated violence, and just as illegal as violence motivated by greed or avarice or jealousy or rage.

&gt;Also see mormons and polygamy/pederasty. We outlawed it. Used to be a mormon dude could marry a 14 year old girl along with a 25 year old woman and share the same bed. Not protected behavior.

This activity is banned regardless of religion though, and excessive regulations targeted at particular religions [have been found unconstitutional.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4446171096119694900&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr)

&gt;I'd argue that a Muslim who believes, due to their religion, that certain people ought to be killed or otherwise forcibly brought to believe the same way, is acting against the existing values of the law in the same way.

You said believes and then followed it by act.  Certainly a violent action, or even association with violent organizations, can be grounds for rejection from admission to the US.  But you haven't shown an action, and you haven't tied "is Muslim" to "believes that certain people ought to be killed."

For instance, I could see a more vindictive mod taking a downvoted top level reply on a popular submission and stickying it, so that it got way more downvotes and tanked the user's karma.One counterargument is that it is generally not possible to lease a used car, and leasing a car is a very popular way for people to acquire their cars.

Now, since this is about financial decisions, yes, leasing a car is a poor financial decision for almost everyone, but if it does happen to be the way you really want to finance your car, then new cars are for you.Do sticky posts in fact impact users' karma counts?

However, for ongoing living, the cost of airconditioning is significantly more expensive than heating, especially considering the outlying options of burning wood for instance. At a personal level, living in a cold environment requires adding a few blankets to your bed to be comfortable. In a warm environment, well-being can be significantly affected without AC.

[Heating a home takes significantly more energy than cooling it most of the time](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13941744)

This is largely due to the temperature differential of a cold climate being greater from the comfortable temperature than that of a warm climate.

I will use an example of a very cold North American city (Montreal, QC) and a very warm city (Las Vegas, NV).

Let's assume a comfortable temperature is about 20 C.

[The hottest average temperature in Montreal is +21](http://www.holiday-weather.com/montreal/averages/) in July and August.  Negligible cooling is required for summer in Montreal, and many homes and businesses don't have air conditioning.  But it of course spikes higher than that and some people do use AC.  Let's say cooling an average of 10 degrees 25% of the time, or 2.5 degrees C average cooling.

In winter, the average temperature is -9.  So you need to heat an average of 29 degrees C 100% of the time (It never gets anywhere near +20 in winter in Montreal).

In total then a household in Montreal would average 31.5 degrees of thermal energy expenditure for the most extreme periods.

In [Las Vegas](http://www.holiday-weather.com/las_vegas/averages/) the hottest average is 34 degrees, requiring cooling an average of 16 degrees 100% of the time in summer.  In winter, average is 8 degrees, requiring heating 12 degrees.  Average highs get close to our 20 degree comfort point though, so call it 75% of the time, or 9 degrees.  So the average thermal change needed in Vegas is 25 degrees, substantially less than the expenditure for a household in Montreal.&gt;Another example would be that Uber driver who was assaulted by a passenger and caught it all on tape. Nobody was crying foul when the passenger lost his job.

This seems different to me in that the passenger committed a crime.  Societally we have accepted that people who commit crimes can suffer severe consequences.  You usually lose your job when you get sent to prison, for instance.

We haven't coalesced around similar consequences for more private (and legal) boorish behavior.  I don't see why it would be a massive investment akin to the interstate system. The infrastructure to deliver electricity everywhere is already in place, we're just talking about the last hundred feet to charge people's cars. That will require some investment, but it's not too insane. Tesla for instance has already deployed a network of fast charge stations along most major interstate routes. And they're a relatively small company with nowhere near the resources of the Federal government. 

Will it take some investment? Yes. But we're talking about some parking spaces, transformers, and plugs. It's not really that expensive to build that. 

Edit to add: you can buy a commercial grade charging station for 2 cars for $3000. This is not totally trivial, but it's really not a ton for a business. I could see a business with a national footprint (McDonalds maybe) putting a charging station all in their parking lots as a promotional thing. $3000 per store as an infrastructure investment really isn't so much. 

http://store.evsolutions.com/mobile/turbodock---pedestal-p60.aspx?utm_medium=cse&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwkeiwBRCzmo-wiKL49pEBEiQAhvGKYRdhzNntCuH919-LeIpo1HX3sG81v_fucY7fE3d6eGkaAsXO8P8HAQMost car owners park overnight at their home 99% of the time. 

As long as the car can handle their daily driving, that would be enough for the large majority of their usage. That's how tesla sells cars, they have so much battery that it's very rare you'd blow through it all (200+ miles) in one day.   So you don't need to charge at every place you stop. 

And if there were a charger in every McDonalds parking lot in the USA that would put one within like 5 miles of 90% of the driving population. It would be enough so people wouldn't have range anxiety. McDonalds is ubiquitous. 

You might have trouble charging in Manhattan, but you also have trouble finding a gas station in Manhattan. Yeah, people have talked about that for a long time. It's a fundamentally silly idea that would be nightmarishly expensive to install and maintain. 

Apart from the absurd expense, you could never make all roads like that, and as long as you need some ability to go on noneletrified roads you lose the advantages of full electrification (no or almost no batteries). 

You can have specific routes that have overhead charging for busses or bus like vehicles. That's basically streetcars. I think there is probably diminishing returns there, and a 500 mi range car is too much range unless batteries get much more efficient in ways that are unlikely. 

Essentially you end up carrying hundreds of kilos of batteries as a security blanket nobody will use, and which reduces the efficiency and performance of the car while adding costs.

There are major tradeoffs to range expansion, and the tradeoffs grow a bit exponentially as you want more and more range. It's a similar but less severe case of the rocket problem. There are two components to this, engineering and cost, so let me separate them. 

On the engineering front additional range equals additional mass. Tesla is planning to manufacture a ton of lithium ion batteries but they're not going to be exceptionally lighter per ampere hour than present day batteries. Unless Tesla has developed some new battery type we don't know about, which probably wouldn't be a lithium ion, since we know about how much charge per kg you can get out of them.

As you add mass, it means you have to expend more energy to accelerate that mass, which diminishes the effect of the additional charge. If you take a tesla with 200 miles of range and exactly double it's energy capacity with additional batteries, it will go less than 400 miles on a charge. 

Additionally the batteries still take space. That will become increasingly difficult to scale with what people expect of a car. 

On the cost side, even at half the cost of current batteries a 500 mile range electric vehicle would be enormously expensive. There's a reason Teslas cost what they do, and it's mostly that the batteries are very expensive. You'd still be talking about hyper luxury cars having that sort of range. That still means you have the major cost of big batteries onboard the car.

But let me get into why this is basically impossible.

A road surface has the following issues to deal with:

* Extreme heat

* Extreme cold

* Rapid temperature variation

* Rain/snow/ice (sometimes all at once)

* Flooding

* Extremely heavy vehicles.

* Vehicles crashing on it.

* Snowplows

* Salt and sand

Right now, we primarily use asphalt on our roads, and that still needs to be replaced every 10-30 years depending on traffic and weather.

There is literally no electronics system you can put in a road surface that can handle these for the kinds of timeframes we demand of roads  It will be the world's worst maintenance nightmare.  The charging lanes will be closed 60% of the time for repair, and suck up the entire highways budget.

We barely keep up with highway maintenance as it is, and the roads are designed for 100% endurance.&gt; How do you explain the $35000 Model 3 that is to come out. Even if it will cost $40-45k, that's less than half of any other Tesla. That cost reduction is hugely from economies of scale more than anything else.

It still hasn't come out.  Tesla has been vaporwaring it for a while now.

But moreover my point was that taking that car to a 500 mile range would bring it back to 100k turf.

It is totally possible to make an electric car with that sort of range.  But I am saying it costs a lot more and has a lot less interior space and performance than one with less range, and I think very few people will be willing to pay the extra cost for range they'll rarely use.I don't ignore them, but such a car has a number of diseconomies.

First, it takes *more* than 2.5x as many batteries as the less range one, because as I said before, each battery has diminishing returns due to added mass.

Second, such a car will be unpopular and not sell a lot of units.  That will mean the per unit cost will be higher than a mass market car because of all the fixed cost that goes into a car model.  The batteries might have economies of scale, but the body and interior and such will lack economies of scale (and will have to be different to accommodate the mass and volume of the extra batteries)You asked me to justify my price projection for such a car.  The fact that it will be sold to people who are willing to pay more means that fewer will be sold.  Luxury cars sell fewer units by a large margin.

This car can exist, but I don't think it will be a popular choice due to expense and worse performance and space.I interpreted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3oe9tm/cmv_barring_a_massive_technological_breakthrough/cvwj34s) as asking me to justify the cost.

In any case, I thought initially you were saying that 500 mile range cars would be the norm.  I think we agree now that's not likely to be the case.&gt;They're still going to have to pay for getting those documents scanned digitally

This is mostly False, since attorneys are required to use the CM/ECF system which requires uploading your documents in PDF or other electronic format to begin with.  A small number of documents (from pro se filers or in certain unusual circumstances from attorneys) do need to be scanned in by the clerk of the court's staff, but they'd have to do that regardless of whether they were publicly accessible, because federal courts use electronic case files.

The space cost added by public access is basically trivial, and the bandwidth costs are likewise pretty trivial. The most expensive part of PACER is the part where you have to manage user accounts to demand payment and restrict access.  The USPTO for instance manages a similar public docket system with free access to the public (called the PAIR).

Also, I would far rather have it taken from my taxes.  Courts are the most important thing the government does, and public access to court records is fundamental to having of a free and open judicial system.  Presently the PACER system makes it difficult for researchers to do investigations into Federal courts for instance.  Any researcher who wants free access needs to be approved by the courts in advance and is subject to whatever restrictions they may wish to impose.

Let's say for instance that Google wanted to create a substitute PACER because their search and data management are miles ahead of the Federal Government.  They do this for patents and some court rulings already, so it's not a crazy idea.  This is 100% legal, since all records on PACER are in the public domain.  But the courts would never let them do it because it would kill their revenue stream.

If records access came from tax dollars, the courts would probably allow this.&gt;So you can view documents for free in the courthouse or house of records.

View, but not print.  If you want to actually have a record to keep in any way, it costs money.

&gt;What youre paying for is the convinience fee of viewing them off-site, at any time, in digital form. 

They're natively in digital form. The Federal courts use an electronic case management and filing system which means records are kept digitally from the outset.

And off-site access is cheaper for the government, because they don't have to supply the hardware or space.

&gt;Digitilizing things isnt cheap.

But PACER doesn't require anything extra be digitized.  The records are already digitized; this is just about access to them.

&gt;There are lots of labor hours that go into it.

Mostly from attorneys who are required to file their documents electronically, and then pay for the privilege of accessing the records.  It's a nice game, making the parties to litigation both do the work of digitizing and pay for access to those same digital records.

&gt;If the government couldnt charge, many courts would simply decide not to digitalize and just leave the paper copies as the only option. 

Lots of other government agencies and courts don't do this.  The US Patent Office for instance maintains a free-access electronic records system for all cases there.  As do most state courts.

And paper copies would be far more expensive to the courts because most of the documents never exist on paper.  The courts would have to invest in massive printing and storage infrastructure to have paper copies to begin with.

&gt;The question becomes: would you rather pay to view the online records, or not have those records online at all?

This is a False dichotomy that does not reflect how the federal courts actually operate and keep their records.&gt;Some guy has a passing interest in some random law or case will start downloading anything and everything connected to it. And no one is going to care how much they download or if they really need those documents in the first place because they are free. Thus the drain on the system will increase.

This seems unlikely given that this doesn't happen with the many other courts and quasi-judicial bodies which have free records.

And anyway, the cost of serving documents on a website is incredibly low.  As long as you stop bots from literally downloading everything en masse (with a captcha or a time limit this can be done), the costs of hosting are pretty trivial.

This is especially so when the government *does not own the rights to the records.*  Court records are in the public domain.  There's no copyright or lawful authority to prevent their reproduction.Can you specifically define what you mean by regulated versus unregulated capitalism?

Capitalism is a system which inherently involves property rights.  And property rights are themselves a form of regulation whereby the government sets rules about how things come to be owned and transferred among people and firms.

I think this is much more a question of how regulated you want markets to be.  Not whether they should be regulated at all.  And I think your post is just way too vague to get into the weeds of that yet.  So I'd like you to supply  more specifics if you can.

*edit: typo*The higher prices came because WA [massively raised alcohol taxes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/06/30/two-years-after-liquor-privatization-booze-in-washington-state-costs-more/) as part of the deal.  Costco isn't making a huge profit on those sales, and overall liquor sales are down, because the taxes are having much more bite than was predicted.

Washington's excise tax on alcohol is by far the highest in the nation at $35.22 a gallon, versus the nationwide median of $5.56.  Oregon is next highest at $22.73/gal.&gt;I have to think more about that to come to a great answer to this.

If you don't know what you mean by these terms I don't know how we could discuss them with any precision.

&gt;unregulated imo is the survival of the fittest, natural selection aka darwins point of view.

Regulation is an action by the government, and really isn't the same as evolutionary biology.  You can make an analogy to evolutionary biology in your discussion of what actions the government should or should not take, but you need the core of the definition to relate to government, not to biology.Sorry infinitestrength, your submission has been removed:

Interstate sports betting is illegal under federal law.  

There is a giant loophole for fantasy sports, which is why you see ads for those one day fantasy companies all over TV when you watch sports.You'll want to edit your post to put a semicolon on the end of that character string to make it a delta, or otherwise copy/paste the symbol from the sidebar.  

Edit: thanks.If anything, it would seem less likely with Vegas than other cities.  It's a lot harder to be an illegal sportsbook in Vegas, because the legal sportsbooks are heavy competition.  And players can't go to the legal sportsbook because they're likely to be recognized and their face will be on camera.  Casinos have cameras *everywhere.*

So that cuts down on players betting on themselves to do badly.

As far as the bribes thing, that's mostly a feature of college sports because the athletes aren't paid and are often desperate for cash.  Pro hockey players on the other hand get paid quite well.  You'd need to bribe them really big, especially the game-impacting stars, to make a difference.  When we're talking multimillion dollar bribes, location doesn't matter - it's trivial to have someone in Vegas or wherever on the phone to place the bets.When you say there should be more harsh punishment for violent rape, I think you're mistaken about how harsh the punishment already is.

For instance, rape by forcible compulsion in NY is [a class B felony](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article130.htm#p130.35) which is subject to a maximum [25 year prison sentence](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/felony_sentences.htm).  You could make it a class A felony, the same as murder, raising the maximum sentence to life.  I don't think that'll add too much deterrent effect though.

Violent rape is already a super severe felony.  Unless you're going to abolish the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, you can't make the punishment that much more severe.The right to free speech is broad, but not absolute.  Most relevant to this conversation, bribery is illegal and speech integral to criminal conduct is not protected by the Constitution.

So for instance, it is illegal for me to approach my Congressman and say "I will give you $100,000 if you vote for bill X."  That speech is speech integral to criminal conduct, and I can be criminally punished for saying it.

Many if not most Super PAC donations are essentially bribes of this type.  They're giving a good of real economic value (advertising) to a candidate or officeholder, with the expectation of some future benefit to the person giving it.

Because bribery is illegal, there is a government interest in reasonable regulations to prevent it.

If we look at the [US District Court decision](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2007cv2240-39) we see that the specific regulations in question were not about whether the ad could be aired at all, as the FEC had agreed it could air, but whether or not it was subject to the following laws:

&gt;Section 201 is a disclosure provision requiring that any corporation spending more than
$10,000 in a calendar year to produce or air electioneering communications must file a report
with the FEC that includes\u2014among other things\u2014the names and addresses of anyone who
contributed $1,000 or more in aggregate to the corporation for the purpose of furthering
electioneering communications. 

and

&gt;Section 311 is a
disclaimer provision. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441d. For advertisements not authorized by a candidate or her
political committee, the statement \u201c____ is responsible for the content of this advertising\u201d must
be spoken during the advertisement and must appear in text on-screen for at least four seconds
during the advertisement. \u00a7 441d(d)(2). In addition, such advertisements are required to include
the name, address, and phone number or web address of the organization behind the
advertisement. 

These disclosure regulations are quite plausibly reasonably within the power of Congress to regulate speech in prevention of legitimately criminal conduct.  Which is what the district court held.Sorry icculus88, your comment has been removed:

&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or **the right of the people peaceably to assemble,** and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

There are valid ways to attack Citizens United, but going after associational freedom isn't a good one.

After all, it would still allow very rich people to just buy the ads personally.That seems like a feature, not a bug.  An issue ad is much less effective as a bribe than a pro-candidate or anti-opponent ad.I'm not saying anonymity in general encourages criminality.  I am saying that the activity of spending large sums of money in a fashion that materially benefits particular candidates for public office has a strong likelihood of itself being a crime.  As such, you should not be able to do so without public knowledge.I don't think that is an accurate summary of the law.  Citizens United was and is organized as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit political advocacy organization.  This case wasn't about the activities that ordinary C corporations can undertake, but about the limitations on independent expenditures by political nonprofits in the periods surrounding elections.&gt;Thanks for the clarification: anonymous (large) donations to political candidates are problematic, and they're problematic because many such donations are criminal. So, hypothetically, 90% of such donations are bribery, and therefore Congress can deny anonymity to all such donations. Is that a fair summary? 

Yes.

&gt;Also, can I ask why this reasoning only applies to large donations?

Well, Congress has some discretion in the matter, so there's no inherent reason they have to include all donations.  There's a good case to be made that very small donations are unlikely to be effective bribes because they're not big enough to influence lawmakers to do anything.  This is for instance the justification behind the caps on donating to individual lawmakers which have historically been upheld.I still think the best case is not to talk about corporate form (since the rules surrounding corporate governance are a whole different ball game, and you're conflating public corporations with private corporations where these issues are much less clear), but rather to attack Citizens United from an anti-bribery standpoint.

Disclosure and quantity limitations on an anti-bribery basis are content-neutral regulations that could plausibly pass muster even after Citizens United.  But Congress has shown no interest in drafting them.Sorry domuseid, your comment has been removed:

The amount of money held by corporate interests in the US far outstrips individual wealth, especially when people who own the wealth don't want to put it at risk. That's a big distinction.

I don't think that's really True.  All property at some point has to be owned by a human being.  The only exception might be the government and nonprofit charities.

But corporations are owned by shareholders.  If the shareholders are other corporations, they'll eventually have human owners if you go through all the layers.  Trusts must have identifiable beneficiaries.  

&gt;There's nothing you can really do about individuals using their own money to press issues - look at Sheldon Adelson. That's not what Citizen's United was about, though.

You can deal with that via laws against bribery.  That's why I think the anti-bribery regulation avenue is the strongest one for campaign finance, it doesn't look really at what is being said, or the form of the speaker, but looks at whether the speaker is giving something of material value to a politician with the explicit or implicit understanding of some material benefit from that politician's exercise of their office.I think the corporate form argument is quite weak because we have long recognized that a corporation can take any otherwise lawful undertaking or expenditure if it complies with the rules surrounding how corporations make decisions.

And we are not willing to ban all corporations from all political speech.  Otherwise, we'd have to ban The New York Times Co. from expending corporate funds on candidate endorsements.But as a shareholder, I see companies take actions I disagree with all the time.  My recourse is to vote against them at shareholder meetings or sell my shares.  

For instance, I probably own a share or two of DirecTV, who are currently spending a lot of money to take a case on class actions to the Supreme Court where they're taking a position with which I disagree.  How is that different than them running an ad for Mitt Romney?  Both are political acts of a sort with which I disagree.

Companies are governed by laws which allow for majoritarian rule of the shareholders (as weighted by ownership).  If you don't like that scheme, don't buy shares of stock.

Besides, you're sidestepping the issue of 100% agreement among shareholders.  Let's say me and my 5 friends all get together to run ads supporting a candidate, and form a corporation to funnel our spending through, since none of us can afford the ads on our own.  All of the shareholders agree on running the ads.  Why is that different than if we just sent 6 checks for 1/6 of the ad cost to the TV station?In other words, yes, you're going to abolish the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.  Because [that's unconstitional.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/433/584)CU was a corporation formed for the purposes of political activity who were forbidden from engaging in electioneering communications within 60 days of an election.  

The only corporations allowed to make such expenditures were political action committees, and donations to such committees were capped by law.  Ordinary 501(c)(4) corporations could not make such expenditures.&gt;Can you explain why this argument wouldn't apply to speech itself, please? I.e.: Could Congress ban speech if, say, 90% of speech consisted of bribes?

I don't know how the courts would handle this situation.  If 90% of all speech of any type were part of a crime, everyone would be committing crimes all day every day.  It would be a total breakdown of law and society.  It's too silly to consider.

&gt;Thanks for explaining. Not sure I buy the argument, but I understand it now.

Don't get me wrong, I recognize that my legal views may not be correct - the court's interpretation of the law has varied over time, and the common law is by its nature a changing beast.  But the prohibition on bribery is a longstanding one, and bribery is a crime that the founders were very concerned about, so the idea of enforcing an anti-bribery statute is commensurate with the original intent surrounding the Constitution.Sorry noluv4uhoes, your comment has been removed:

This is complicated.  I'll try to give you the rough lay of the land.

There are certain types of speech which are not at all protected by the Constitution.  They are:^1

* Obscenity

* Fraud 

* Defamation

* Incitement to violence

* Speech integral to criminal conduct.

All speech that doesn't clearly fall into one of those categories has at least some level of protection under the Constitution.

Depending on the broad category of speech, you are afforded different levels of protection.  From least to most, you have commercial speech, ordinary speech, and core political speech.

Restrictions on commercial speech need to further an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest.

Restrictions on ordinary or core political speech are usually subjected to strict scrutiny, meaning they must be related to a compelling government interest, be narrowly tailored towards that interest, and be the least restrictive means of accomplishing that goal.  Core political speech (which usually means any speech about government at any level) will be especially protected.

So to restrict core political speech the crime in question must be a very important one,^2 the rule must not extend past what's needed to enforce the law against that crime, and must use as light a touch as possible to stop the crime and not restrict noncriminal speech.

^1 List derived from [United States v. Stevens](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-769.pdf) which helpfully lists them as a critical part of its holding that animal abuse porn was not categorically unprotected under the first amendment.

^2 It's not a lock that bribery would meet this standard, though there's a [recent ruling upholding a Florida rule banning judges from soliciting donations](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1499_d18e.pdf) that might tilt in that direction.I don't think a workable amendment can be written.  You'd have to change a huge portion of free speech law, which presently provides the US with the strongest speech protection in the world.    The best bet really is to have more effective laws against bribery and a better enforcement mechanism.  

For instance, Jeb Bush clearly was fundraising for his super pac before he declared with the intention of running for President, and was illegally coordinating.  There's a very good case to be made there, and a few successful cases of those types would probably curtail the worst activities substantially.

Alternately, you could provide sufficiently generous public funding with sufficient strings attached to cause candidates not to engage in these sort of shenanigans.  But by being opt-in, it avoids the majority of first amendment issues.That's an insane position.  You are essentially asking to abolish the essential principles that have safeguarded freedom in our country in order to give extra cruelty to some people you dislike.

You are literally proposing tyranny and torture.Sorry xxganjamastaxx, your comment has been removed:

I agree that there are some holes in my case here, if you wanted I could poke them pretty wide open.

But the point I really want to get across is that this is a very hard problem.  There is a genuine problem in American democracy when politicians are spending something like 70% of their time dialing for dollars, and where [a tiny number of people are spending nearly all of the money in politics.](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/11/us/politics/2016-presidential-election-super-pac-donors.html)  There is definite evidence out there about money buying influence in a way that is very likely corrupt.

At the same time, the US has historically had the strongest free speech laws in the world, and I don't want to give that up.

Constitutional law is also a very complicated thing.  There are very few clear answers to be had.  Sometimes there are, like in [this interesting case about double jeopardy](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-5967_7m5e.pdf), but usually it's a lot harder than you'd think.Sorry coolasafool462, your submission has been removed:

The budget of a school is inherently limited.  Most schools are funded by local property taxes and don't have a lot of room to acquire more funds for new staff.

This is especially True in Michigan where major cities have been experiencing huge budget crises and really don't have the funding for adding staff to their schools.  Most famously of course there's Detroit's recent trip through bankruptcy court, but many other cities are also in distress.  Flint has also been under an emergency manager and does not have much of any wiggle room in its budget.

As such, you need to show that these positions are the best use of the school's limited budget.  Which staff do you think should be let go to make these positions available?

If you want to increase the school budget overall to pay for it, which other municipal services (sanitation, police, roads, ambulances, etc) do you want to cut to pay for it?

Having everyone at least apply to the local community college provides the best baseline you can do with a very limited budget for guidance.  It provides everyone somewhere affordable to attend, and which can be levered to going to a better four year school, often with less cost than going directly to a four year school.

Doing just a little more can be dangerous, since you can have students being advised to apply to selective schools that will not offer them a lot of aid and where they'll end up in debt.  There are some selective schools which are absolutely terrible choices for students from low income backgrounds.  [Sarah Lawrence College](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?195304-Sarah-Lawrence-College) for instance is basically a very fancy school that puts its students in massive debt.  Unless you're from a very rich family, you shouldn't go to Sarah Lawrence.&gt; Firstly, thank you for that case, it was very interesting. I didn't get all the references, but I followed the argument, with one exception. Namely, Illinois versus Somerville. I don't really understand why, if jeopardy is born when the jury is empaneled and sworn in, a mistrial isn't eligible for double jeopardy. I suppose there would have to an exception for cases wherein the defendant had caused the mistrial (or else he could deliberately torpedo the proceedings)?

A mistrial isn't a verdict.  Double jeopardy means that once you're found not guilty, you can never be tried again no matter what.  A mistrial is not a verdict on your guilt or innocence.  It's the "technical difficulties, please stand by" of court proceedings.

You can also be retried after a guilty verdict.  If, for instance, an appeals court rules a particular piece of evidence to have been illegally obtained, you could be retried without that evidence if the prosecution thinks they can still make the case.

&gt;Secondly, I'm not so sure there is a problem. Maybe I'm looking at it wrong, but I believe that ordinary (I.e.: middle and working class) citizens do have the funds to outvote current expenditures, but choose not to. Furthermore, the wealthy are a minority when it comes to votes, so there's a cost less way to defeat them every election-cycle. Finally, to address your point about fundraising, I agree that it may be a suboptimal use of time. Atleast, I hope it is. However, it may reflect the professionalisation of public policy: once upon a time Congressmen and women had to try and work things out, to a relatively large degree. Today, they have economists, journalists, and think tanks, to say nothing of their own private staffs. Besides which, opinion polls may have supplanted the town hall temperature-check. I'm not saying this explains everything, or that there isn't a problem, but I don't wonder if it isn't a bit overstated sometimes.

There's a case that it's overstated, but I do think it's a nontrivial problem.  We are clearly seeing public officials substantially changing their in-office behavior due to the donations of a small group of people.  Money causing public officeholders to do their jobs differently is basically the fundamental thing we're trying to avoid in banning bribery.

I do think that political ads are much less effective than politicians seem to think, so there is a bit of a point there.  But the behavior alteration on the part of officeholders is real, even if they are mistaken about how much the ads matter.&gt;The right to assemble sort of implies that they're doing so willingly, yes? When a company that isn't an explicitly political group acts in a political way, it very often contributes in a way that some of the people making up that company don't agree with.

When you buy shares in a company, you know the deal you're signing up for.  Under most (all?) states' corporate laws, public companies operate under majority share rule. You are aware the company may do things you disagree with if the majority of shareholders vote against you, or elect board members/executives whom you disagree with.  Your recourse is to sell your shares.

Majority share rule is the way companies make all their decisions.  If unanimous agreement were the rule, public companies would never do anything.

&gt;Further, a company isn't a political group and shouldn't be considered an "assembly," for these purposes.

Why not?  It's a group of people organized to some purpose, which naturally may intersect with policy and politics.  Should a company be prohibited from advocating before Congress regarding a bill that will impact their business for instance?

&gt;Lastly, even if they were considered an assembly of people, there's nothing in the constitution (to my knowledge; correct me if I'm wrong) that states that any person, group, or entity has the official right to contribute to a political campaign.

There is literally one sentence in the constitution about free speech.  If you wanted to take that one sentence very literally, it would probably cut against you and prohibit *any* law which impairs the freedom of speech or the right of the people to assemble, since it says "Congress shall make **no law**"abridging them.  The Supreme Court, in the tradition of the English common law from which US law arises, has crafted rules around this based on the cases brought before it.  In those cases, the court has held that political contributions are a form of speech.&gt;For point 1, I was pretty much talking about employees, not shareholders.

I really don't see the case here.  The owners of the company are the ones who get to decide how its resources are used.  That's a pretty important part of the definition of ownership.

&gt;Frankly, yes. The owner can and should go voice his or her opinion as a person, but he or she should not get to shout into a microphone made of money

This is a policy argument, not a constitutional argument.  Almost all effective speech involves some expenditure of money.  And the courts have held that the spending of money to further your otherwise constitutionally protected speech is a constitutionally protected activity.

If you want to ban spending of money on political speech, you need to define the line.  Am I not allowed to pay the train or bus fare necessary to attend a rally?  Am I not allowed to spend money on posterboard and markers?  Am I not allowed to buy a literal microphone or bullhorn?  Where's the line between money I can spend and money I can't?Sorry jrafferty, your submission has been removed:

The owners *are* the shareholders.  They do not owe a fiduciary duty to themselves; they owe no duty to themselves and can do what they damn well please with their company.&gt;This doesn't make sense to me, in light of jeopardy starting when the jury is impaneled and sworn in. Don't both those things occur during mistrials or retrials? How is that squared away?

It's a two part question, part one is "did jeopardy attach?" and part two is "did the court reach a verdict on the merits?"  If the answer is yes to both, then and only then does double jeopardy apply.

In the Illinois case, jeopardy attached when the jury was sworn.  And the court reached a verdict on the merits when it said the defendant was not guilty because the government had presented no evidence of his guilt.

The Supreme Court addresses this two part nature in the ruling.  The second part only gets like one paragraph because it's super clear.

In the case of a guilty verdict, if the defendant accepts the verdict, then double jeopardy would apply and he could not be retried.  But by appealing, the defendant specifically waives their right to keep the old verdict by asking it to be overturned.  As such, they can (sometimes) be tried again if the old verdict is dismissed on appeal.

&gt;What's the evidence that they're changing their behavior? Are you referring to the time spent soliciting donations?

Mostly that, yes, as well as the increased access donors get to politicians.Huh, I never had that issue when I was in college, which wasn't all that long ago.  Was it a particularly tight rental market where shenanigans were likely?It's not a terrible objective assessment to be honest.  Considering how high the dropout rates are at most colleges (50% is the national average) someone who comes to me with student aid as their source of paying the rent seems very likely to stiff me as compared to someone with money income from a job.I've removed this for appearing to be spam.In the context of an apartment near the campus in a town dominated by a college, if you leave your apartment in December, I might not be able to find a new tenant til August or September of next year.  

So yeah, you're very likely to pay the rent for the first semester, but for the second semester...?  This is doubly True if you're signing a roommate lease where finding a suitable person to take your room may be quite difficult.

If you have a job and a good credit history it's likely you have money in savings which lets you manage your bills well, and have a long history of paying your bills on time.Do you agree that property ownership in general is a fundamental right?

I think there is a good case to be made that the government should not be depriving people of ownership of their lawfully acquired property, no matter what property that is, and guns are a form of lawfully acquired property.That's actually not True.  For instance, when alcohol prohibition went into force, it was still legal to own and drink alcohol you had purchased prior to prohibition.  It just banned the sale of alcohol.

A gun acquired within the law today remains "lawfully acquired" even if it is banned tomorrow.&gt;In general, yes, but this isn't about the general case. This is about the specific case. Nobody who argues that people have a right to property also argue that people have a right to ANY property. People were once property in this country.

Unlike in the case of owning a human being, owning a hunk of metal does not inherently infringe on anyone else's rights.  Using the hunk of metal in certain ways can infringe their rights, and it might be a particularly heavily regulated hunk of metal, but it is not analagous to owning a human being, which is inherently an act of infringing others' rights.

&gt;First off, why not? If said property is dangerous or in the hands of someone explicitly with the intent to do harm on others (and, since we're in rights talk here, take away the rights of others), should the government not confiscate that property, regardless of how it is obtained? If a person expressed intent to create and use explosives, you don't just let him keep it after he's served his time, even if he legally acquired 500 pounds of fertilizer or whatever you need.

The government can and does regulate property in this manner.  The right to property isn't absolute.  The law requires that you not be deprived of it without due process of law or in the alternative, without just compensation.

If you go through legal process to show someone should be deprived of specific property for a specific reason, then the government can take that property.

This is much like how they can seize money out of your bank account if you're found guilty of speeding and don't voluntarily pay the fine.

&gt;So we should permit the sale of nuclear weapons or C4 to the common citizen?

These are different from one another.  It is possible to acquire high explosives as a private citizen, though not possible to acquire nuclear weaponry.  

The degree of regulation appropriate depends on the range of lawful uses and the danger to the public though, and the government can proscribe certain uses and apply certain regulations.  Guns are less dangerous than nukes, and have more valid lawful uses.  As such, they should not be subject to the wholesale ban that we put on weapons of mass destruction.

&gt;You completely missed the heart of my argument. Why should it be legal?

Because guns are useful.  Even in countries without a specific right to bear arms, guns are generally not banned.  Canada for instance has much stricter gun regulations than the US, but does not outright ban guns.  They even have [special reduced regulations](http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/fs-fd/wild-sauvage-eng.htm) for when you're in an especially dangerous area where you might need a loaded weapon to defend against wildlife.

I think there's a strong case for more regulation of guns, much like other property is regulated.  But very very little property is outright banned, and I don't think there's a case that guns should fall in that small range of banned property.If such a law were passed in the US, it would likely be found to violate the 5th amendment, unless it paid market prices to buy back such guns.

The 5th amendment provides that "No person... shall be  deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." 

In the UK, you don't have constitutional rights, so Parliament can just do what they want.Eh, the US government is pretty damn rich.  There are around 300 million guns in the US?  At around $1000 each, that would be $300 billion.  That's a lot, but the US government could afford it as a one time expense if they really wanted to.

And "it's expensive to comply with the Constitution" is not an argument that federal courts have found persuasive.That's also not so clear actually.  Remember prohibition required a constitutional amendment.

There is a principle called "regulatory takings" whereby imposing regulation to the point where property is simply not able to be used or sold becomes effectively a 5th amendment taking.

For an interesting discussion of takings law on personal property, I'd direct you to the recent case of [Horne v. Dep't of Agriculture.](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-275_c0n2.pdf)Sorry ec6863, your submission has been removed:

Keeping and using property is one part of that right.  Creating and disposing of property is another part of it.

Property law of course is a complex thing, but I think there is a strong case to be made from a moral standpoint that gun laws should be subject to the standard laws of property, and that protection of all of one's right to property is a fundamental right.

For instance, such a law would essentially destroy the property of many business owners by making their gun manufacturing facilities, gun stores, and gun distribution businesses worthless by fiat.Please specify how you think this insurrection is going down?

Are they trying to claim specific territory as their own and defend that territory, or engage in guerilla warfare without claiming specific territory?  What is their level of support among the local population, and what are their rough demands?

The most obvious cases of suppressing insurrections are riot suppressions.  There have been periods where local areas take a day or two to be brought under control, but the US government can simply throw mass numbers at the problem if needed.  They can send hundreds of thousands of soldiers and federal officers, as well as nationalizing every state's national guard and marching them there.

Keep in mind as well, there are a lot of consequences to armed insurrection.  When you lose, you spend the rest of your life in prison.  That's an effective deterrent for most people.I find it implausible that such a situation would still have a cohesive US military.  Much more likely if such a situation were to arise is a constitutional crisis or coup d'etat.&gt; if we can't control the border in a time of piece during an insurgency it would be impossible. 

We could quite easily control the southern border if we were willing to use military force to do so.  As it stands, we are not willing to shoot people on sight for breaking the law against illegal entry, and thus we need to capture them, which is much harder.The US military is very much a part of American society.  If American society were so strained that a large portion of the population wanted to engage in violent rebellion, a large portion of the military would support them.  They would likely openly defy orders to engage an insurgency, and would possibly attempt to join it and/or depose the President.Sorry axearm, your comment has been removed:

The right of property under law does not generally allow all of the right of transferring property to be abolished.  If you say that my property cannot be sold or given away, you have deprived me of some of the fundamental aspects of owning that property.  It would be what's known in US law as a "regulatory taking" and I would be entitled to compensation from the government for the loss of property.The point I was trying to make to OP was that an attempt to ban ownership of guns invokes a fundamental rights analysis is that attempting to ban *anything* invokes a fundamental rights analysis.Also Lincoln was tactically brilliant to use the resupply of Fort Sumter as a mechanism to essentially force South Carolina to shoot first or else accede to the Federal government maintaining a key fort in the most secessionist city in the South.Cities are the economic centers of the world.  By concentrating a lot of people in a relatively small space, you get subspecialties that are not possible elsewhere.

For one small example, NYC can support a huge number of media businesses, such as NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox, and HBO, all of whom are headquartered within a few blocks of each other in midtown Manhattan.  The fact that they're all right there means that a bunch of people can make a living doing things like set design, audio mixing, etc.  And the companies have a deep pool of talent to draw from when people leave.  If NBC were headquartered in Wilkes-Barre, PA, they might have a really hard time hiring some temporary set designers for a big production because there's not enough business there to justify an independent company doing just that.  In NYC, there is that demand, and such companies exist.

You get a sum greater than your parts by bringing people together in a city, because both people and businesses can become much more specialized.  And that fine specialization (called division of labor by economists) is key to growth.

So why does this mean you want more affordable housing?  It doesn't exactly.  It means you want more housing, period.  NYC has ~8 million people.  If the housing were built to raise that to ~10 million, which is quite possible with highrises, I bet the city's economy would increase by more than 25%, because more new specializations would be found and more people would become more specialized with a bigger potential customer base.

**TL;DR concentrating people together brings big growth, so you want more housing in cities to get bigger economic growth.**Yes, there is a fundamental right to own those things.  And we abrogate that right, much like we abrogate your fundamental right to free speech when that speech is "I will pay you $100,000 to kill my husband."  If you want to abrogate the right to property, you need to go through the legal process by which we decide the boundaries surrounding rights.The biggest way is to loosen zoning restrictions.  Generally most cities cap how much housing can be built by capping how tall or otherwise dense buildings can be.  If you loosen zoning restrictions and allow more apartment buildings and towers, developers will come in and build new housing without a specific government program.  Generally the new tax revenue from the new residents and higher property taxes on more developed land means it will pay for itself.&gt;I think a more realistic "government rate" would be $200 per firearm, so that's only $60 billion.

That is nowhere close to the retail price of a new gun.  And this will be litigated in a federal court.  I don't think it's likely you'd get anywhere close to that low a price.  I think people will be entitled to at minimum what they paid for the gun, plus inflation.

Also, Medicare principally covers people over 65. [The distribution of murder victims skews very young.](https://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0311.pdf)  Assuming gunshot wounds follow a similar pattern, you're not gonna save much there.In trying for brevity I was overly simplistic.  I think guns should be treated like other property.  The government can't just ban any property it pleases, but it can undertake some policies to effectively ban it.

The precise nature of those policies is governed in the US by the 5th amendment, which has 2 provisions dealing with property:

&gt;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, **nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.**

I don't see guns as being special, but I do see the right to property as one that is worth defending.  Government can limit property use, but taking it completely requires either a trial to show why you aren't entitled to it (due process) or for the government to pay you for it.

So if the government wants your lawfully obtained smallpox sample, they can pay you the market value of the vial.To add on to this, since space in these cities is essentially fixed, a tax break will likely just turn into even more local inflation, because the prices are based on bidding wars, and if you make the people bidding have more income, they'll just bid higher.I don't think they would.  It would need to come from tax revenue.Oh, it has a snowball's chance in hell of happening.  I was replying to someone who said that the government literally couldn't afford to do it.  The government could afford it.  They just won't.I wasn't really advocating for affordable housing programs.  My preference would be to upzone drastically so that more people can live in the city.  It doesn't require a program exactly, just a deregulation.I don't think the policy choices taken by NYC are good at all.

You don't need to make sure the new housing has affordable units set aside, or make sure it isn't high end.  You just need much, much more housing.  

The Toronto area is my model here.  They don't have a large amount of policy about building affordable housing.  But condo towers are going up all over the place.  And it is actually effective at keeping housing costs down.  Land prices are through the roof, but families can find places to live because there are towers going up.

For instance, there are [145 10 story plus buildings](http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=12&amp;statusID=2) under construction in Toronto, versus [111 in NYC,](http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=8&amp;statusID=2) And Toronto has about 1/3 of NYC's population.

Toronto thus has had [fairly static rents](https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-toronto-rent-trends/) despite a huge housing boom.  

This is fundamentally about supply and demand.  There is an enormous level of demand to live in NYC.  If you don't increase supply to keep up with demand, then you're going to see housing costs bid up to unaffordable levels.

Instead of a lottery where a tiny fraction of people can get an affordable apartment, and where nobody who gets a rent regulated apartment can ever move because they'll lose their rent break, I think a large upzoning has the potential over time to actually make housing affordable for people who aren't in a government program.


If New York were building towers at the rate Toronto is, we would have 466 10 story plus buildings under construction, and that would do a huge amount to push down prices for ordinary New Yorkers.  

One last point:

&gt; I cannot imagine how a low income person could just get up and move-- and there are low income people in NYC who have to choose between riding the subway and groceries.

If your income is low and you are in NYC, you almost 100% have subsidized housing, either rent control, stabilization, or NYCHA.  If so, you cannot move.  You just can't, or you'll lose the subsidy that makes it possible to live in NY.  This means people end up having stupid commutes or inappropriate apartments (larger families crowded into 1brs and single older people in 4 bedrooms).  Regular working 9-5 taxpayers are the least likely people to start an armed insurrection.  They have an enormous amount to lose, and are generally quite risk averse.

In any case, there are many income support programs in place already, from welfare, to the EITC, to social security, to food stamps, which have not cause violent insurrection or anything like it.

If the policy is unpopular with voters, it will not get adopted or repealed.  Ordinary policy like this (especially policy that impacts everyone more or less equally) simply does not get violent revolutions to happen.There's a lot to address here, so I want to try and break it into three parts.  I'm going to address why I think current NYC zoning laws are problematic for building more housing, why I think things to set aside some housing as "affordable" are ineffective, and why I think the foreign buyers point is a red herring.

*  **Current NYC zoning laws are far too restrictive of new housing**

R10 is the densest housing zone allowed in NYC.  [It has a maximum floor area ratio of 10](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r10.shtml) which means that a 10,000 square foot lot can support no more than a 100,000 square foot interior building.  With walls and elevators and stairwells, that comes to about 15 floors.  If you want to build higher, you need a variance. You are generally limited in height overall, as well as being required under "tower on a base" rules to have substantial setbacks and only use about 1/3 of your building's footprint for a tower.  If you want to build a more traditional tower, you need a variance.  So if you want real high density housing, you can't do it within ordinary zoning laws.  You need to get special approval.

In Toronto by contrast, the highest zoning category is CR (commercial/residential) which allows an unlimited floor area ratio, and for basically whatever (nonindustrial) use you please for the building.

Second, and relatedly, **variances in NYC are fundamentally corrupt.**  You need to get support from local community boards and politicians, which essentially means you need to bribe people with campaign contributions, and you need to use the "right" contractors and subcontractors.  That adds huge and unnecessary cost and expense to developing in NYC.  It's also why the developers who do work in NYC are so skeezy; they're on one side of a massively corrupt system, and honest developers are pushed out.

Ontario on the other hand has a [province-wide zoning appeals system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Municipal_Board) which follows the precedent a city has set with respect to other buildings.  So variances from zoning can't be arbitrarily denied or held up for disfavored developers, and cities can't institute an NYC like regime of regularly requiring ad hoc variances for all significant development.

At a minimum I would upgrade R8, R9, and R10 zones to be unlimited height unlimited density, and bump most zones in the city up a zone or three to boot.  There is a lot of low hanging fruit out there on upzoning.  For instance the area around Jamacia station is one of the most transit accessible in the whole city.  And yet huge swaths of the walking-distance area [is zoned R2](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/zone/map15a.pdf), which is [a single family housing zone.](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/zh_r2.shtml)  That whole area should be zoned for skyscrapers.

* **Setting aside housing is ineffective.**

Like it or not, there is huge demand to live in New York City.  
If you set aside some housing as "affordable" you create two problems.  First, it does nothing to tamp down that demand, and second it promotes people gaming the system.

Setting aside units as "affordable" drives up the price of market rate units still further, as it means yet fewer of them exist for people to buy or rent.  The only way to bring down market prices is to add supply to the market.  And that means allowing a lot more new construction.  Using a lottery to divvy up housing is deeply cruel and makes it impossible for people to plan or make choices for themselves.  Most people will lose the lottery, and end up not being able to afford to live in the city.  But if we build more housing, prices come down for everyone, and we let markets allocate the scarce good like they do for every other good.

Also, importantly, when people move into new housing, they generally move out of old housing.  That creates vacancies and units that need to be sold or rented.  Market forces then act to make those units cheaper as supply floods the market and landlords/sellers need to find tenants/buyers.

* **Foreign buyers are a red herring.**

None of the policies NYC has address them at all.  And you couldn't address them if you tried.  You can't seize the property of foreigners or prevent them from buying property, because the Constitution protects the right to property.  You can't tax them extra because being a foreigner is a protected class under the Constitution and a tax on foreigners would be unconstitutional.

If they're gonna buy the units, they're gonna buy the units and there's nothing you can do to stop them.  What you can do is build even more housing so that their buying units doesn't have as much of a percentage impact.

As to the other global cities you mention, they should also be allowing more construction if they want affordable housing.  London is the worst offender here.  They really don't allow much construction there at all, and without that prices will just keep getting higher.Screen grab these and put them on paper.

But accounting for context and intent matters.  A zero tolerance policy on drugs means schools treat a kid having tylenol in their bag the same as a kid having heroin.  It leads to [absurd cases like illegally strip searching a 13 year old to look for ibuprofen.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safford_Unified_School_District_v._Redding)

Any policy which ignores context and intent is almost always a bad idea, unless the underlying act is one that has a near certainty of causing death or serious injury.I don't see why it's inhumane to require unanimity for a conclusive result.  Especially this is True in the context of criminal law.  We're not trying to say that we believe it more likely than not the defendant is guilty.

We are trying to say that it has been conclusively proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty.

A court acts on that decision to impose severe and life altering (and often life ruining) punishments.  Those punishments should be reserved for cases of extreme certainty about guilt, and requiring unanimity is one mechanism for preventing innocent people from having their lives ruined by an insufficiently strong case.Sorry, I removed this for rule C.  The title you use is just a bare description of facts.  Nobody could really change that view.

If you could repost this with a title that includes some sort of a value statement like:

That would be allowed.There's no rule against participating on a removed thread.  

But yeah, sorry.  We like to catch these early to prevent that sort of thing.  If it had been up for a couple hours and had a lot of discussion I wouldn't have yanked it.Thanks for continuing to engage with me on this.  I do think there's a lot of agreement here on building a *lot* more housing in NYC.  I think from what you're saying you agree that it's the only long-term solution.

I do want to make a few points though, hopefully to change your view on either lottery based things like 80/20 or province/statewide zoning appeals.

**For zoning appeals:**

My fundamental view is that the right to build a tower on a particular parcel should not be a political decision to begin with, because ad hoc decisions are contrary to the rule of law.

The role of elected officials and government is to set and enforce general rules that apply equally to everyone.  That's what it means to have the rule of law - the same rules apply to everyone.  There is a proper role of officials and communities in setting those rules, but once they're set, they should apply to everyone the same.

Variances fundamentally are contrary to rule of law, because they're giving one person or developer an exemption from the rules everyone else has to play by.  

The Ontario Municipal Board essentially forces municipalities to keep within rule of law.  It operates as a court, not an elected body.  It does not set zoning rules for municipalities, but rather it adjudicates whether those municipalities have followed the rules they themselves set, and whether their enforcement is consistent with the precedents set by that municipality.

If I were doing this for New York, I would create a court of zoning appeals, with jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from any municipal zoning board in the state, and with appeal from the court of zoning appeals to the court of appeals (NY's highest court).

**For lotteries:**

My point about them is that they reduce the housing stock that exists at market rates, and thus actively hurt the people who lose lotteries.  The foreign buyers can still buy within the 80% that's market rate, so you don't exclude them, and it has no impact there.

But by reducing the supply of market rate housing, it means market prices go up, and so everyone who lost the lottery has a that much less affordable city.

I don't want to abolish all affordable housing policy overnight, it would probably be a 10-20 year transition to abolish rent stabilization and control for instance.  But in the long run it's a disaster.  And right now it's not a stop gap.  It's been in place for many decades and shows no signs of going anywhere.

Lastly, I want to address one thing you mentioned:

&gt; I'm not sure reducing the localized nature of the process is a good idea. I mean, who are we ultimately building for?

We are building for people who don't currently have a vote because they can't afford to live in NYC. There might be 50 people on a block near Jamaica station who don't want to be upzoned.  But there are 2000 people who would live there if you could put a tower up.  Those 2000 people don't have a vote in an election.  But I care about their wellbeing too.Sorry madmilton49, your comment has been removed:

1.  It is in fact a requirement for an immigrant to learn English before becoming a citizen.  [There are two tests you must pass to become a naturalized citizen: civics and English.](http://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/learn-about-naturalization)

2.  New immigrants are not entitled to welfare payments.  [Most means-tested programs have a 5 year bar from the date of becoming a permanent resident.](http://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/summary-immigrant-eligibility-restrictions-under-current-law)  Some (like SSI) are only eligible to citizens.  

3.  Driver's licenses are not citizenship documents, and foreigners can legally drive in the US.  [The US is party to several treaties allowing foreign residents to drive here.](http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/86800.pdf)  Temporary and permanent immigrants to the US are legally allowed to obtain US drivers licenses as well if they choose.Well, it depends what you mean by "discrimination."   On the broadest definition of the term, of course it is.  It distinguishes two identifiable groups for disparate treatment.

The more interesting question is if this is the sort of discrimination which should be banned by law.  And I think there's a decent case that it's not.

First, it is an accurate predictor of behavior.  [Men, especially young men,](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9672/) really do cause a hugely disproportionate share of car crashes.

Second, while it is an immutable characteristic, it is not a group which has faced historical discrimination of the type that would necessitate counterbalancing to ensure some measure of equal opportunity.

Third, prohibiting discrimination has negative consequences.  It will lower rates for drivers who are more likely to crash, which means higher rates for everyone else.  Further, by lowering rates for those most likely to crash, it makes them more likely to own cars, which is how you get [an insurance death spiral.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_spiral_\(insurance\))

It also is likely to cause less accurate proxies for sex to be used by insurers in an attempt to do better underwriting (big discounts for having been in girl scouts for instance).  This just ends up being really inefficient discrimination on the same thing you were trying to ban.You need to separately reply to montiburns to give them a delta.It was done to protect Hillary, and it does benefit her.  She won't agree to this, and without her nobody will watch the debate.

It benefits her because she has the least to gain and most to lose from debates.  She is very well known to voters, almost all of whom have strong opinions about her.  She does not need extra press exposure, and if she did want it, has mechanisms to get it on much more favorable terms than a debate.  

Next to nobody pays attention to the number of debates that take place, and the people who do are political junkies who have made their minds up already.First, no media outlet cares about any candidate besides Clinton and Sanders.  If O'Malley, Webb, and Chafee stood on a stage by themselves, nobody would notice.

I don't think "more than 6 debates" is a banner many people are going to rally around.  Clinton can very easily give an interview (which will get massive coverage since she gives so few) where she calls it a silly stunt and says she looks forward to debating the other candidates on [date of next sanctioned debate].  Plus Sanders has a lot to lose by trying to pull of a stunt, it looks desperate and gimmicky and undermines his policy focused message.  Sanders has made it a big part of his campaign not to attack Clinton on anything but substantive policy, which is a lot of his appeal.  Going after her in such an aggressive and gimmicky way would destroy his brand far more than hers. Thanks for replying, and hope you get your other stuff done.

&gt;I want to say that your point about the 2000 people who haven't moved in yet is a great one, but it conflicts the US-American principle of protecting the few from the majority. This principle often wins out over many 'greater good' arguments, not just in housing but in everything. Other than using eminent domain, it's a very long road get the few out of the way of the many.

Generally the argument is used in reference to preventing the majority from using government compulsion to harm a minority.

This case is flipped on its head, with the minority using government compulsion to harm the disenfranchised majority.

&gt;Now, variances are not supposed to be granted willy nilly, they are supposed to avoid spot zoning that would render overall zoning areas useless.

If this is what you want, then the principles surrounding variances should be codified and courts should determine whether applicants have met those principles and are entitled to a variance.

Having a political body adjudicate individual applications is still something I'm not in favor of.

&gt;Regarding affordable housing, it is something that is consistently evolving, but government intervention (instead of free market forces) is here to stay and considered part of the bundle of civil rights. There is an entire initiative out of HUD working on regulatory practices to increase affordable housing-- this goes way beyond NYC zoning regs.

My argument isn't about constitutionality or current federal law, it's about best policy choices.  There's no reading of the Fair Housing Act requires the 80/20 rule or anything like it.  Its existence is a policy choice of NYC and NYS.

My proposal would be to scrap the tax credits and 20% rule, and use the extra tax revenue to either build more public housing or provide more vouchers for private housing.  I don't think that policy would violate FHA at all.

For this to force her into the extra debates, she has to feel pressure, and the pressure only comes from attacking her.  If you just asked politely "Secy. Clinton, would you like to attend these extra unsanctioned debates?" she'd answer "No, I think the party's schedule is fine."

You need a campaign of attacking her and putting her on the defensive to force her to say yes.  Mounting that campaign hurts Sanders far more than it hurts Clinton.

Did you check if other providers are also having comparably high rates?  If there's a cheaper provider out there at the same tier, maybe you can switch to them.From an accounting perspective, what's happening is essentially that a lot of plans were lowballing their premiums for the first year or two hoping to get big enrollment numbers (who would then stick around even if they didn't have the lowest premiums going forwards).  That's now ending.

As well, the population of people buying on the exchanges is much poorer and sicker than was initially expected, with relatively few policies being sold to people like you who get no subsidies, and relatively many policies being sold to people who get large subsidies.

The ban on preexisting conditions and on practices like investigating large claimants for fraud by not disclosing preexisitng conditions has changed the market a lot, and it does raise premiums across the board.

As some evidence that the plan is reducing costs somewhere though, I'll point to NY, which had guaranteed issue (no preexisitng conditions) and community rating (everyone pays the same) for years before the ACA.  Premiums are way down from what they were before the law.  Personally, I went from paying $221 a month for a 10k deductible plan to this year upcoming $125 a month for a ~$6300 deductible plan.

For most states that did allow underwriting pre-ACA, premiums are up though, by a lot.  The subsidies help if your income is low enough, but as it sounds like you're making 100k+ a year, you don't qualify.

All that said, on a personal level you might want to consider the higher deductible plans.  It's a wash if your expenses are high, but if they're low you can save money.

Unless you know you're likely to have high costs (e.g. someone has an expensive disease like diabetes), and assuming you're sufficiently liquid to cover the deductibles, I'd suggest even rummaging around the bronze plans.

&gt;It's probably not accurate to say that the ACA has caused those cost increases, because it's possible that costs might have gone up even more without it, as the ACA does include some cost control provisions.

While it's True that costs were rising well before the ACA, a good chunk of the increase in individual health insurance premiums (as separate from total healthcare costs) comes from the ACA.  The elimination of preexisitng conditions makes the insurance pool much sicker, and community rating means that those sick patients are subsidized by healthy ones.  

It's not a problem for you usually if you get the tax credit, but if your income is high enough to not qualify, it does cost you more.They don't all have to offer the same prices.  Networks and prices can vary.  For instance I was looking at catastrophic plans in my county in NY, and they vary from $125.47/month to $347.17/month for an individual plan.The example I think of is a poker table, which is an environment where two people can collude to gain an advantage over you.

Most casinos which offer poker only allow one language at the table for this reason.  "English only at the table" is actually something you'll hear from time to time if you're playing poker at a casino in the US.I just want to clarify something because I think we might just be talking about different things.

Any particular insurer cannot vary prices except on age and smoking,  I agree with that.  But different insurers can have different prices for the same policy.

E.g. Anthem can charge $400 a month for that plan, and Blue Shield can charge $450 for the same plan on their different network, if they so choose.

I'll try to go mostly from first premises, but my overarching premise in this is that we want a form of government which produces overall good lives for the people in its jurisdiction.

* 1\. **Government is better than no government.**

There's ample historical evidence that anarchic societies have low quality of life and are unstable.  The most successful countries and societies on Earth all have governments.  I can go into sourcing this if you insist, but I think it's pretty uncontroversial.

* 2\.  **Totalitarian government is worse than democratic government.**

Again, this isn't so controversial.  Countries with totalitarian or one party states are less successful than those with pluralistic government schemes.  There are some small counterexamples (Singapore, mostly), but the trends are still pretty robust.

* 3\.  **Within a democratic government, simple structures are better than complicated structures.**

This is a more controversial claim, so let me make my case.  Having a simple basic structure leads to more transparent and common-sense enforcement of the law.  For instance, the US Constitution is a very short and fairly straightforward document.  Major policies and structures are dealt with in usually one sentence or less.  The first amendment for instance protects 5 different rights and provides one major constraint on state action, all in one sentence.

&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

A simple and straightforward constitution generally performs better at securing rights than one which is convoluted and full of exceptions.  Each exception is an opportunity for gamesmanship.  This is seen in the Constitution of California, which is amendable by popular referendum and [has a bunch of clauses which don't belong in a constitution.](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html)  And as a result of the messed up Constitution, day to day governance in California can be a nightmare.  For instance, there's a special hurdle for tax hikes, but not for cuts.  It means that [the state has resorted to issuing IOUs](http://money.cnn.com/2009/07/02/news/economy/California_IOUs/) at points instead of paying its bills.

* 4\.  **"Everyone has the right to vote" is a simple and workable rule.**

The rule works well enough, and has been shown to work in a lot of different countries.  And when restrictions on voting are permitted, the self-interested nature of politicians means they're highly likely to be implemented in a manner so as to help assure those politicians' re-election, not to further a legitimate governmental purpose.

Just letting everyone vote is straightforward and basically impossible to game.  I've been to unescorted processions before.  But we also stopped at red lights.  It's just a bunch of cars driving in a line together.Huh, I almost never see escorts for funerals around me, and I'm in the NYC metro area where stuff is plenty crowded and it might not be a bad idea.Your situation is quite unusual in how much pedestrian traffic is there.  Changing the law or social norms for a relatively small number of situations is inappropriate.

This is especially True when all technical solutions have not been exhausted.  In your case, I'd ask your city to give your street a green right turn arrow as part of the light cycle, and appropriately adjust the pedestrian walk signs so that they're solid red when the turn arrow is green.Sorry Ernie_Anders, your submission has been removed:

All other rules apply to all comments.

We're generally more lenient with rule 5 further down comment chains.  A bare link in a top level comment is never ok, but might be ok later in a chain if someone had said "hey can you link me the source on that?"  But a bare link that nobody asked for is pretty much always a rule 5 violation.&gt;How often are amendments like this proposed by members of Congress? Do they hold the gravity one might expect from a proposal to alter the fundamental document that rules our government, or are they commonly used to make political statements?

Not super often, but not that uncommonly.  [Bush for instance pushed an anti-gay-marriage amendment back in 2004 after MA's supreme court legalized it there.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Marriage_Amendment)  In general, it's riskier to propose an amendment because the language is very brief and plain for everyone to see, so you can't propose a big bill and say "this is a bill to protect American families" or whatever.  Everyone will scrutinize the exact words you're using.

Like we are now!

&gt;Is the amendment too broad in scope, or do the problems with campaign financing necessitate giving the government such broad power given the current "money is speech" interpretation of the First Amendment?

It is way, way too broad.  Section II for instance would directly conflict with some key free speech/free association rulings such as [NAACP v. Alabama.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP_v._Alabama)

Sections I and III also contradict each other.  It says only natural persons may influence elections, but that the freedom of the press (which includes influencing elections by press corporations) is not limited. 

You can't just say two contrary things in a constitutional amendment.  This amendment provides no clear guidance for the courts or public as to what is trying to be protected versus banned.    

&gt;The amendment is unique from all others in that it very specifically gives Congress and the States the power to enact legislation to "protect the fairness and integrity of the electoral process." Is this wording potentially problematic in deciding discrepancies between Federal and State law, or do you think that the Supremacy Clause is safe from any real scrutiny?

This was tried once before in [the 18th amendment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)  But I don't know of any instances where the Federal government had a direct conflict with a State government overstepping its 18th Amendment authority before the Amendment's repeal.

The Supremacy clause would not apply to this amendment, and it is quite likely to be a big problem.  I could see states using this amendment to suppress groups they didn't like, [such as NAACP voter drives,](http://www.naacpdc.org/committees/political.htm) and not being able to be constrained by things like the Voting Rights Act.

&gt;Do Section I and Section III directly contradict each other, or does Section III merely provide an exception to the rule that is Section I? Is there legal precedent for amendments being written in this fashion outside of our Constitution? How would a court rule on an amendment where two sections are in direct contradiction of one another?

There's no precedent for two directly contrary clauses in the same amendment.  There are later clauses in the constitution which contradict earlier ones, and the later enacted one wins.  But two contrary clauses in the same amendment has never happened.

And I do think they conflict as I talked briefly about above.

&gt;Finally, and perhaps the most contentious. Is money speech?

Not in and of itself, but spending money is integral to engaging in speech in many respects.  If I spend $10 on a train ticket to get to a rally, that's money spent in furtherance of speech.&gt;I like the outline of the plan, lowering tax rates but offsetting by making everyone actually pay them via the removal of loopholes has always made sense to me.

I don't think Trump's plan actually does this.  He claims it does, but the rate cuts he wants are so large, and the
