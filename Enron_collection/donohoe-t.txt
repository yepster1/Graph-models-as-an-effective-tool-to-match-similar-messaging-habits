 I got the info but wanted to know more about the preset programs.  The net advertisement shows 20 preset programs, but the info I received only shows 4.  I also wanted to know what the display looked like.  The literature does not show what the display  looks like.  I have what the 9.2 looks like but it appears that the 9.6 is different.  Also how fast does this machine get to. This machine has a 10 year warrenty.  Who will service this in Texas and If for any reason treadmill by net ceases to exist, what are the conditions of my warrenty.  On the preset programs can I just say I want to run X distance whether it is a hill workout, time or what ever?  What is the maximum amount of time a workout can be programmed to?  Are there only 10 segments even in a user defined program?  If I wanted 20 intervals in an interval workout is that possible?   If I wanted to run for an hour, does each segment have to be 6 minutes?  Tom Donohoe 
 Here is the contract information.  The contract group could not locate the CES-Devon contract so all I have is the info from TAGG and Sitara.  For the GTC and GISB contracts that have no paper, I wrote price and location on the EXCEL spreadsheat.  Tom Donohoe 
 I am in need of several more contract copies.  Could you please forward me contract: 96037261 96049419 96001003 96045391  Also, you had mentioned earlier that GISB contracts should not have been used on some of the contracts I earlier received.  Are the appropriate contracts going to be sent out,  or are we stuck with the ones in place.  Call with questions.  3-7151  Sincerely Tom Donohoe
