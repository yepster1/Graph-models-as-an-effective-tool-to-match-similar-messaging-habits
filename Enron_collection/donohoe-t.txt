 I got the info but wanted to know more about the preset programs.  The net advertisement shows 20 preset programs, but the info I received only shows 4.  I also wanted to know what the display looked like.  The literature does not show what the display  looks like.  I have what the 9.2 looks like but it appears that the 9.6 is different.  Also how fast does this machine get to. This machine has a 10 year warrenty.  Who will service this in Texas and If for any reason treadmill by net ceases to exist, what are the conditions of my warrenty.  On the preset programs can I just say I want to run X distance whether it is a hill workout, time or what ever?  What is the maximum amount of time a workout can be programmed to?  Are there only 10 segments even in a user defined program?  If I wanted 20 intervals in an interval workout is that possible?   If I wanted to run for an hour, does each segment have to be 6 minutes?  Tom Donohoe

 I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

 Dear Todd,  I did not hear from Jay at E-Prime.  Were my qualifications not what he was looking for?  I would like to have your phone number for future reference.   Sincerely,   Tom Donohoe 
 I am not sure these are right for my experience.  I have not ever traded power. 
 It requires a strong knowledge of the wholesale electricity business, and minimum gas knowledge.  It also requires a solid understanding of options evaluation.  I have traded the options but do not have a strong understanding of the greeks. 
 Mr. Lay,  Reuters just had an article that said upon closing of the Dynegy deal, you will receive $80,000,000 which buys you out of your employment contract.  Is this true?  If so, since you said in your speech that we are all feeling this pain together, will there be a distribution of the $80,000,000 back to the people who's lives have been crushed and will receive no additional compensation.  It seems unjust that while the people who had nothing to do with the downfall get nothing, the people who were involved in the downfall continue to be well compensated.  I,  as a trader on the gas floor,  am sitting here at my desk still making all attempts to make money for the company, wondering if  I will be getting my next paycheck.  Then I read that you are getting an additional $80,000,000.  I, as well as my fellow employees, feel betrayed once again.  What is the old saying about kicking the dead horse?  The difference is that this horse is still barely breathing and your $80,000,000 just sucked out the final bit of life.  The management level you have been at provides you the inside scoop on all these bad deals and the "pump and dump" that senior management has done to Enron stock over the last years.  It is a disgrace the way you and your senior management have ruined so many peoples lives.  How could you not know that the company would be taking a fall when you signed back on.  Other CEO's coming back into companies under the same situation have accepted no compensation until the company gets back on its feet again.  It seems that you knew what was going to happen, and were able to milk Enron out of another 80
