 Chris,  I have reviewed the Confirmation Letter and have the following comments and/or questions: PREAMBLE PARAGRAPH ONE Company name should be Riverside County Waste Management Department.  PREAMBLE PARAGRAPH TWO There are various references to "this SC Agreement", which is not a defined term anywhere; should the reference to "this SC Agreement" really mean "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement"?  ARTICLE 2 SECTION 2.1 has a reference to SCE1 which appears to be different that the reference to the Delivery Point, which is defined as SP-15? SECTION 2.2 has a reference to to Attachment 1and there is no Attachment 1. SECTION 2.4 (v) was deleted and SECTION 2.4 (vi) was renumbered as SECTION 2.4 (v). SECTIOM 2.4 (v) indicates that the Index Price shall be the Dow Jones Index NP-15; why is this the case when earlier in SECTION 2.1 the Delivery Point is defined as SP-15?  The last sentence indicates a name of "Hanson" which I believe should really be "RCWMD". SECTION 2.5 again has reference to "this SC Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement".  Also, there is a reference to "RCWMD's usage", shouldn't the terminology in the case of this contract be "production" and "deliveries"?  ARTICLE 3 SECTION 3.1 should have the following added to the beginning of the sentence "RCWMD". SECTION 3.2 again refers to terminology "energy deliveries and usage" which I believe should be "energy production and deliveries".  ARTICLE 4 SECTION 4.2 refers to "consumed" which I believe should be "delivered" or "produced". SECTION 4.5 has a reference to Attachment 2 and there is no Attachment 2.  There is again a reference to "receive" and "consume" which should probably be "deliver" and "consume". SECTIOM 4.7 refers to "Term Purchase", which is not a defined term, at least in the Confirmation Letter.  There is also a reference to Exhibit A and there is no Exhibit A; we previously referred to Attachments rather than Exhibits so we need to make sure that we are consistent.  ARTICLE 5 SECTION 5.1 contains language regarding Scheduling Coordination services, is this fee normal and did you intend for it to be included in this contract.  ARTICLE 6 SECTION 6.1 contains reference to "this SC Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement". SECTION 6.2 contains reference to "this Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement". SECTION 6.6 contains reference to "this Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement". SECTION 6.8 contains reference to "Schdule ____", which appears to be absent.  When you get this e-mail lets talk about the comments.  I would like to have a conference call with Riverside on Wednesday October 31st.  Regards,  Richard 
  Peggy,  Pursuant to our telephone conversation attached is the letter from Edward McKenna, ISO-NE, and a copy of the Protocal for the Initiation of Membership Termination Proceedings.  Richard 
 Stacey, =20 Elliot and I would like to discuss a few issues with you regarding the MS R= PS Comments.  What time do you think that you will have to discuss? =20 =20 <http://www.energy.ca.gov/renewables/documents/index.html#greenpower> =20 =20 =20 F-1:  Need to require that all current renewable facilities, including all = current existing boimass facilities are certified prior to the start date R= PS =20 F-5:  Not sure that I understand the issue surrounding compliance on a prod= uct level - let's discuss =20 F-7:  While we are very pleased with the Division's inclusion of banking, w= e do not understand the need to restrict the limit on how much Supplier's a= re allowed to bank as the shelf life for Renewable Energy Credits is alread= y limited to the two compliance periods immediately following.  We would al= so ask that you not limit the ability for Suppliers to transfer banked Rene= wable Energy Credits during the allowed compliance periods.  We feel that t= he Division should encourage as much liquidity as possible in the Renewable= Energy Credit market.  We understand the Division's concern regarding tran= sferable banking and potential problems with market power, however, we feel= that the GIS Administrator is charged with closely monitoring potential ma= rket power situations.  We would prefer that the Renewable Energy Credit ma= rket be allowed to operate as indicated above from the beginning and if it = is determined that market power issues exist then appropriate changes to th= e market can and should be implemented.  We feel that markets operate best = with few restrictions. =20 =20 F-9: Section 4. Not sure I understand the difference between the percentage= of sales versus the actual MWh's - let's discuss =20 F-9: Section 5. Not sure that this language makes sense - let's discuss=20 
 Rogers,  Enron Energy Services, Inc. ("EESI") submitted application to become a NEPO= OL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO= L Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On= e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po= licy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe= r Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the = Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than = corporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate = Guaranty required by NEPOOL.  EESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th= e amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J= une 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New = England dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)= and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu= rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th= e amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d= elivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter= to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need= ed to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit= Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t= o the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati= on with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations= with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t= hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r= esolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc= tober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20  I was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa= ny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance= Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin= g invoices for "other" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1= 50,000.  The "other" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI= , since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J= eff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the "= other" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque= st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w= as issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo= ber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October = 23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to = resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond = company as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe= rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor= king diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via= FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor= mance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20  I notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par= ticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.
