It's a negligible difference in most well-optimized games, but it's a problem in Assassin's Creed: Unity and Thief and a few others.http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/1888-evga-supersc-4gb-960-benchmark-vs-2gb/Page-2

You're overstating it a bit. Negligible in most games. We're not talking 4k/QHD here, this is a midrange card.3-10% performance improvement plus smoothness 
(that can be alleviated by slightly lower settings) for 20% increased cost makes it a tradeoff individual buyers will have to evaluate.It might not be last-mile fiber, could just be fiber for their network "mains"I think a GTX 760, GTX 670, HD7950, or R9 280 are your best bets.[Amazon also has it](http://www.amazon.com/Asus-TURBO-GTX960-OC-2GD5-ASUS-Graphics-Cards/dp/B00WJOU6RM) for the same price ARWhile I can't comment on the additional value, this is Gigabyte's flagship (highest OC, best cooler, backplate) 970, so it usually runs a bit more than the stock/lower OC'd models.If you're having trouble moving these and would be willing to sell one instead, let me know. Local.Hmm, $300 is a little steep for me. Are those pricier OC'd models? 

There was a stock blower-style EVGA B-Stock the other day for $250, btw.Sorry, wasn't trying to lowball you, just letting you know if you need a cheap blower style. Tempting but still a little much for me. How much for the G1?Your racism is becoming a problem for others.First off, what are your target games? No sense in upgrading if you don't need it. Also what resolution is your monitor? Do you have a rough budget?

I favor a staggered upgrade approach, attacking whatever is the most limiting first.



Your initial upgrade should be on your video card. Your CPU isn't top-of-the-line but it's serviceable for gaming. It's not the limiting component right now. 8GB of ram is still the standard recommendation for a gaming machine.

I think something like a GTX 960 or 950, or an R9 280/285/380 makes sense, in the $150-225 range. Bumping up to a GTX 970 or R9 290/390 if you have the money would be worthwhile, but might run into the limitations of the CPU.Ok, for mixed-use between gaming and demanding design/editing work that might be a little different, based on your priorities. An i7 would be a decent upgrade, although still less urgent than a GPU upgrade. You're probably going to want more RAM than that for the large project files in Maya/Adobe.

A dream &lt;$1500 system would involve a 5/6000-series i7 ($300+), 16-32GB of DDR4 RAM ($100-200), a GTX 970 ($300), and an SSD main drive ($100-$200), plus a socket 1051/2011 mobo ($150-250) which would kick ass at both gaming and work. If you don't already have an SSD, that will make a big difference, followed by the GPU, then the trifecta of CPU/RAM/Mobo to improve render/design performance.Interested in the 970. Where in CA are you located?That said, don't be afraid to take it in steps! Just the SSD and GPU upgrade alone will make a big difference.Ah, I'm LA. PM sent.[Here's benchmarks with both those cards](http://www.techspot.com/review/1006-the-witcher-3-benchmarks/page2.html) (or at least a regular 760, so add on another fps or two.) You're looking at a 2-7fps increase from your current card, depending on resolution and settings. (what is your res and what settings do you want to play at?)

Here's what you do to upgrade/squeeze more performance out of your current machine:

* OC your CPU to at least 3.2 GHz
* Buy a used GTX 970 or R9 290 for $250-275 shipped on /r/hardwareswap, a GTX 780 or R9 280x for (~$200) if that's too steep.
* Sell your GTX 760 Ti for $125-150 either on /r/hardwareswap or eBay or w/eIf you're spending $260 on an AMD CPU+Motherboard, I'd recommend switching to something like the $175 i5-4460 and a cheaper $90 motherboard with a Z97/H97 or Z87/H87 chipset. (You wouldn't need the Z really if you don't have an Intel CPU that ends in K). Your current motherboard supports SLI/CF which if you don't need you could save some money on, even if you stick with AMD.

It also would give you some more leeway on the power supply requirements, which you're cutting it close on. Running a $1000+ dollar PC on a $40 500W power supply isn't super advisable, especially one you want to overclock. If your power supply dies, it can take other stuff with it.That's correct. Non-K Intel CPUs don't have unlocked multipliers (they can still be somewhat OC'd via frequency but not much)

Either of those CPU options would be fine if you're playing stock or lightly-modded Skyrim, it's several years old now.You can mount the cooler in either a front-to-back or bottom-to-top airflow configuration, neither is incorrect. However, you probably can't use both fans of the cooler in a bottom-to-top airflow config if you want to use that PCIe lane.

Either rotate the cooler 90deg, remove the outer fan, or move your GPU to the other slot, the choice is yours.Both your CPU and your GPU are going to give you issues running at 1080p with high settings, and your tiny power supply is a bit limited for your GPU upgrades. Ideally you want an i5 (which you can keep your ram if you stick to 5000 series or below), and a GTX 960 would allow you to keep your current PSU without running into issues. That would let you get 1080p high settings at 55-60fps.All of those games are not out yet so it's all speculation. [Star Citizen pre-alpha is not optimized and barely runs at 1080p on very high settings on even a 980Ti.](http://www.gamersnexus.net/game-bench/1992-star-citizen-113-gpu-benchmark)Your CPU is 5 years old, so probably that to an i5 first. Then upgrade GPU in a year when next gen comes out or sooner if you can afford it. If you don't go Skylake you can keep the same RAM. Also an SSD would be a good upgrade, even just a 256GB one.Actually the [Witcher isn't very CPU-bound](http://www.techspot.com/review/1006-the-witcher-3-benchmarks/page5.html) and yours probably handles Skyrim fine even if it's more CPU-bound. Fallout 4 is speculation at this point. So you could see better results in the games you play with a GPU upgrade to a GTX 970/980 or an AMD R9 290/390. Don't bother with any GPU upgrade cheaper than those, it won't be worth it. Your CPU will be holding you back in The Witcher 3, but only slightly. If you overclock it you could get some extra life out of it.Ok, if you've already got it overclocked (you didn't say before) then you're within 10% of the gaming performance of any other AM3+ socket CPU. AMD is not competitive for high-end gaming right now. Only an upgrade to an i5 or higher (sandy bridge 2000 series or newer) is worthwhile.

Either go Intel or save up \u00a3225 for a GTX 970 or R9 290 graphics card, with the CPU overclock that'll be a more cost-effective upgrade, roughly +50% performance.

Try /r/hardwareswap to see if there's any used gear you can snag, or /r/buildapcsalesukPurchased a GTX 970 from /u/cruzin_cruzingThe system requirements haven't been released yet, so your guess is as good as anyone's. Seeing as you want to play it on the highest settings, $250 will probably not get you there if it has high requirements. Either get a $175 i5-4000 series and a &lt;$75 H97 motherboard (you can reuse your RAM) or get a new R9 280/280x/380 or GTX 960. 

You can also find good used deals on /r/hardwareswap, you might be able to snag an i3/i5, motherboard, and a GPU like a GTX 760, HD 7870/7970 for around $250.You should say you're Canadian in the title so people get your pricing correct.Just be aware that the Pentium Dual-core runs into issues on Far Cry 4/Dragon Age: Inquisition and possibly other future games because it's only dual core and they coded those games poorly. If you could go cheaper on the case, that could help you bump up to an i3, which is still dual core but the hyperthreading makes it work.Don't worry about your CPU, it's fine. PCIe is backwards compatible. The older versions have less bandwidth but there's plenty of bandwidth to go around. [We're talking like 0.5fps loss between a 2.0 x16 slot and a 3.0 x16 slot.](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GTX_980_PCI-Express_Scaling/3.html)

Put all your money into a new GPU. Or maybe a GPU and an SSD if you don't have one of those. SSD won't make your gameplay faster but you'll load way faster and your computer will be more responsive. Do you have at least 8GB of RAM? Just upgraded from a 560Ti 448 to a 970 myself and still have the i5-2500K. Gaming doesn't really require an i7 unless you have a top-of-the-line everything else or you're doing stuff besides gaming.I agree, the 770 is not the most robust card for high frame rates. [It gets roughly 45fps at 1440p on GTAV](http://www.techspot.com/review/991-gta-5-pc-benchmarks/page2.html), for example. 90Hz+ 1440p gaming on demanding games is the realm of R9 390s and GTX 980s on up. **OP, what games are you playing/planning to play?**

[Here's some good monitor picks from Tech Report.](http://techreport.com/review/29143/tr-october-2015-peripheral-staff-picks) Honestly though, you'll be better off saving that money for a GPU upgrade sometime next year. Maybe snag a cheap 1080p IPS if the colors are really bothering you.I think in Canada the pricing is a little more competitive except for [the Visiontek 380's current sale price at Amazon.ca](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/visiontek-video-card-900808).
You can cap frame rate without turning on vsync![You could probably save money by switching to an i5 without losing significant gaming performance.](http://www.techspot.com/review/1041-intel-core-i7-6700k-skylake/page10.html) &lt;5% performance vs a gen 4 i5. In general once you have an i5 money is better spent on the GPU, unless you already are buying a 980Ti or Titan X. The 150EUR difference between the i7-6700 and the i5-6600K could go towards upgrading that 980 to a 980Ti (10-25%+ gaming performance).Nice. i3s perform almost as well as i5s and i7s in most games. Your GPU and power supply will be what you'll want to upgrade first but you can get some life out of them first at moderate settings on stuff like GTA V. This system will be great for LoL though and anything not super demanding.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CvoHXzaHKY

Or like, use google.~~That was just one game example, you didn't really answer the question.~~

Ahhh the edit. DotA 2 1440p should be doable, BF4 gets about 26fps on a 770 at 1440p on ultra (I think), but might be able to do med-high 1440p @ 60fps or higher.The link was comparing the gen 4 i5, but expect only slightly increased gaming performance from the gen 6 i5. I was using German pricing on the i5-6600K and other parts from pcpartpicker.com, I don't know the prices of where you're buying from. Prebuilt systems vendors tend to give out CPU upgrades cheaply but the things that actually matter for gaming (GPUs) they overcharge.

If you do have the option of doing a gen 4/5 i5 system instead for cheaper, I'd encourage you to go that route.

Entschuldigung ich kanne nicht mehr helfen. Ich bin nicht ein Deutscher, ich bin ein Amerikanischer. (Und meine Deutsch ist...nicht gut)High or ultra, yes. and Minimum can mean anything from medium 1080p on down.No, the 770 is a rebranded 680. The 970 is a different chip with a different transistor count and die size from the 780. Doesn't make it much of an upgrade, depending on the game, but it's not the same.Swap that GTX 960 for an R9 380 4GB and I think you're hitting the best bang for buck.It's not a rule but that's usually how it lines up.I think you can find a better power supply value out there, $90 for a modular 450W is a bit much. Maybe this one:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-120g10650xr

Everything else looks good.SSD or GPU, 8GB of RAM is ok for now. 

For $500 you could spend $250 on a 4th gen Core i5 and an H97 motherboard (keeping the same RAM), and spend $200 on a R9 380. Also not a huge fan of your power supply, that CX series is not the best, you could probably replace it with the remaining $50.If you can overclock your current CPU you might be able to squeeze some more life out and not bottleneck with something like a GTX 960, but expect a CPU upgrade in your near future. The games you name should be ok though. GTA V might give you a little trouble. Reading the FAQAMD is competitive on the low end but beyond that Intel owns the market. Still, a GPU upgrade should be your first priority.To be clear he thought you were asking about CPUs only.Well, you'll probably be bottlenecked by your CPU at that point, but more imporantly an R9 390 can use up to 320W depending on the model, and that would strain your already not-great power supply. I think a more reasonable route is the 380, getting a better power supply, and a 256GB SSD, then save up for a CPU upgrade in the future.Yeah, you're at the mercy of the vendor. I guess go with the 6600K. Pairing that with a 980 is totally fine, it'll just be slightly slower at gaming than an i5 + 980Ti would be, but the i7 is faster at everything else. It's an awesome PC, don't sweat it.

Danke f\u00fcr deine Kompliment, aber meine Deutsch-Kopfworterbuch ist viele klein. 6 Monaten im M\u00fcnchen in 2009. I had to use Google Translate a little for your response!2nding GPU, everything else can compete just fine. Maybe an R9 290/390 or GTX 970 would get you there, or just turn your AA down.You might be orienting the motherboard wrong? You should be using the four raised parts in the upper left in this view:
http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71lFY9WbMFL._SL1200_.jpg

Plus adding the little golden standoffs that came with the case into the matching screw holes for the other two holes on the motherboard.
Take a photo and show us what you're doing.Buy a better 500W+ power supply and get an R9 280/285/380 or GTX 960.Read the FAQYou don't need a Z97 motherboard with a non-K Intel CPU as it won't allow overclocking anyways. Get an H97 and save $50, spend it on a better power supply or a larger SSD or both. Also you don't need such an insane CPU cooler if you're not overclocking, a $25-30 one will do just fine like the Hyper 212+.What kind of Windows do you own? OEM or Retail?It's not bad, it's a midrange card and it's not going to give you 8000fps in CS:GO.That's an unreasonable expectation. This isn't about feelings. Here's a benchmark that has an i5-2400 (close enough) paired with a 7770 and a 7970, you'd fall somewhere between the two: http://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_tabelle2_05_0c7d4a8182.jpg
It's basically the performance you're getting. Realize that getting 200fps means that your card is generating a new 1080p image with dynamic shadows, specular mapping, image filtering, and antialiasing every 5 milliseconds.Is your 4670 overclocked? You might be able to make up the performance difference with that alone, because it's probably a 5fps difference at most.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2dqyet/processor_for_guild_wars_2_i5_4690k_vs_i7_4790k/You might be ok, but OEM copies are technically meant for one set of hardware. In some cases you have to call in and answer some questions and they activate you, but if you're not changing motherboard you should be fine.Ok, well I don't think the i7 is going to make it that much better, but if it's worth $300 for you to try, go for it.Yes, it's almost always still hot in October, every year in the last 5 that I can recall. Sometimes it's been over 100.In general the best future proofing you can do is buying mid-upper range cards more often rather than high end cards less often.

That said, the R9 390 is about 50% faster than the 380. But you won't necessarily see that 50% with your current CPU. It may be more like 25% faster.Nice, the only other thing I just noticed is the hard drive you picked. It's one designed for DVRs, so it spins slower than a normal 7200RPM drive. I'd recommend a 1 TB Western Digital Blue, they run about $45-55. Faster, double the space, almost the same price:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd10ealxGet a 280X, or 380 or a GTX 960 4GBYou're not telling us what you're going to use it for, and you're also not telling us the actual brand and model of most of the components you've listed. Use pcpartpicker.com for the latter.Yeah that's been sorta wrong since the mid-90s. It's like calling a train an engine, the engine's just the part that makes it go.That CPU/GPU combo you've selected will average 55fps on GTA V on bare minimum settings at 720p, but will drop to 10-20fps at times. Which is to say, it's playable, but it's gonna struggle at 1080p pretty hard. You really should be using a dedicated graphics card, because that and the Witcher 3 are two of the most demanding games out there.Traffic is worse on the direct route, naturally.I'm guessing Jefferson Park/Baldwin Hills based off the angle of the Ritz-Carlton and the lack of visible hills except for the slight one the location is on.Don't you think that the building next to it would appear way bigger if it was from that angle? In the photo it looks farther away. I also think to get that exact angle it would actually be obscured by the other downtown buildings.Waiting never hurts when computer buying. Cheaper prices, greater joy of anticipation.

Bitte. Tsch\u00fc\u00df!Man that Titan X is just burning money compared to a 980Ti.Switch the CPU to the i5-6600K and use to money to buy a bigger SSD. There's little gaming performance difference between the i5 and i7 because the only difference is a slightly higher clock, turbothreading (not used for gaming) and a slightly larger L3 cache.

(If you plan on doing heavy rendering/encoding/compression ignore this advice)And in two years you'll be able to buy something better than a Titan X for the price of a 980. The most cost-effective way to future proof is to buy for your needs in the next year or two.

Also what AA are you using? [This review](http://www.tweaktown.com/tweakipedia/90/much-vram-need-1080p-1440p-4k-aa-enabled/index.html) only hits 4.5GB RAM at 1440p and 8x MSAAThat's not 1440p, that's UWQHD.That's fine, but I would say your CPU is a bit overpowered compared to your graphics card, which will benefit games more.You're spending an awful lot on a CPU cooler and skimping on the GPU/Power Supply. It looks like you want to overclock but honestly your CPU is not the bottleneck here, it's the GPU. I'd also say the 960 4GB is not the best value right now vs the R9 380, but if you are going that route, this one is cheaper right now:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-gtx9604gd5toc

Maybe this power supply instead? 

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220gs0550v1Any of a number of reasons: Because it would mean there's less incentive to upgrade, and game makers are partners with the hardware companies. They need each other.

Because in multiplayer games different settings could create an unfair advantage.

However, in many games you can achieve lower settings by modifying the game's ini files to achieve the super-minimal setting you want.No, because then people would have to make their game look like total crap to be competitive, some people want it to look decent and be competitive and have the hardware to do so.Games aren't really fully utilizing 4 cores anyways, surely one can handle the streaming.No, but you will probably be bottlenecked by your CPU and RAM, so I'd aim to upgrade those next.If you restart from the SSD, can you reboot in safe mode? It's possible your drivers are causing the issue.What kind of bugs? If they can't fly you could put the computer on a little pedestal and then surround the legs of it with something those bugs don't like, like baby powder or an anti-bug powder, or put the legs in shallow cups of water.http://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10Cheaper non-overclocking CPU + cheaper non-overclocking motherboard. Cheaper RAM. Bigger/way better SSD. Smaller regular hard drive. More versatile video card.

You can overclock on a P67/Z68, whatchu talkin' bout?!?You'll need to make sure the BIOS is updated to a version that supports Ivy Bridge (3207 or newer), but yes.That can't OC.Unless you can borrow a Sandy Bridge CPU to flash it, kinda. You could also find like the cheapest socket 1155 Pentium/Celeron you can get your hands on, probably &lt;$20 on eBay, flash it, and pop in your ivy bridge.Like this:
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Intel-Pentium-G620-bare-CPU-/281877298643?hash=item41a1323dd3:g:Mb8AAOSwNphWXT7q

http://www.ebay.com/itm/Intel-Celeron-G465-HT-CPU-1-9-GHz-SR0S8-2nd-gen-LGA-1155-Sandy-Bridge-35W-/141844284072?hash=item21069402a8:g:E0oAAOSwwE5WYP5LWere there standoffs where there were no motherboard holes? How did the standoffs hitch a ride?&gt; ASUS P8H61-M LE/CSM R2.0

Oh, it's one of those funky Asus non-Z/P series OC models?p67 was when they were trying a shitload of different models, it's the Z68 without quick sync/onboard GPU support and Smart Response Tech (SSD/caching).P67 has no iGPU support or quick sync or SSD caching (using a little ssd as a hard drive cache, not really needed with today's SSD pricing).  Beyond that it's on a model-by-model basis.What I meant was, some motherboards don't have holes in all the places you can put standoffs. This means standoffs could be underneath your board in a spot that could short something out. It sounds like you didn't put any standoffs in those places?

It sounds like you're saying when you tried to unscrew the screws from the standoffs instead of unscrewing the screws it unscrewed the standoffs. Next time you'll want to snug the standoffs a little more first so that doesn't happen, but it shouldn't have caused an issue.

I'd suggest disconnecting all the front panel stuff you don't need except for the power button, then trying again. You could also post a picture of the inside of your case for us to troubleshoot.

Can you also provide your system specs?*depending on if it's a heavily OC'd model or not. If it doesn't have a PCIe 6-pin connector, it's definitely less than 75W.

~~However, there's no low profile GTX 750/750Ti. I think the best you can do is GT 740 or R7 250.~~ There are a few 750Tis http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127836

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125680You can try booting with only 1 RAM stick at a time, but please provide your system spec so I can give more specific advice. If your power supply is rotten and fried your motherboard you don't want to get another motherboard just to fry it too.I assume you have the RAM in the recommended slot(s)?Well, I don't think it's the SSD's fault, more likely something that changed during the movement of the PC or the install itself.

I'd sugget reseating the graphics card and making sure its PCIe power connector(s) are plugged in.Some people really like the Ikea Markus. Also look into a used Herman Miller Aeron or Steelcase on Craigslist. They retail for way more but companies are always getting rid of them.The Samsung and Sandisk are pretty close in performance, but I agree the Samsung should be a little faster and have a little longer lifespan. The way SSD prices are headed not sure how much anyone needs to worry about lifespan though.From what I've seen, the iGPU should get you by until then no problem. If you don't have a pressing new GPU need, why not wait?

EDIT made a few changes to save you some euros. Equally good cheaper 850W power supply, cheaper RAM, cheaper HDD.

You can't overclock that CPU anyways so I wouldn't bother with the motherboard.

Power supply is a valid upgrade option. It's probably ok for now but you could do better.

What resolution do you play at? Are you finding specific games aren't playing how you want or are you just itching to upgrade?No, ATX sizes are unrelated. However, B150 is targeted at business users, hence the "B", so they're mostly MicroATX, because they don't need the extra real estate.

The table in this wiki page explains the differences:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_1151It sounds like he thrashed his motherboard a bit, from his 1st paragraph.Fanless maybe, depends on where the setup is sitting. A passive CPU cooler plus a big, slow 140mm front fan probably would be a safe thing to try.That's more of an "it's ok" jonnyGURU review. It's not bad, just not ideal if you ever want to overclock.What games?At least when it first came out, Fallout 4 it did. Their last few patch notes have mentioned "memory improvements" so that may have fixed the performance gap between DDR3-1333 and DDR3-2400.

http://www.techspot.com/review/1089-fallout-4-benchmarks/page6.htmlWho said need? OP has expressed a desire to overclock in the future, and that's just a so-so PSU, so I said it's a valid option.There aren't any SLI-compatible H170s either. There are Crossfire compatible B150 and H170 motherboards, but not all of them are. SLI has more hoops for manufacturers to jump through.No, it's probably because Fallout 4 is having poor memory management, hence why the patches to fix it.

Open world games have been around and this is the first time RAM's been an issue.That's not really better than a 280x.Ok, so yeah Fallout 4, Witcher 3, and Far Cry 4 are three of the most PC-destroying games. Witcher and Far Cry are mostly GPU-dependent, Fallout is also CPU dependent but your CPU is fine.PSU + GPU + SSD. You're not going to keep your existing graphics cards when you upgrade, you'll need to remove them and put the new one in.

Depending on how much you want to spend, I'd recommend (from slowest to fastest, give or take): R7 370, GTX 950, GTX 960, R9 380 4GB, R9 380x, GTX 970, R9 390

And yes, also grab a new power supply. Prebuilts always come with crap ones.Depends on the settings, Witcher 3 can bring anything to its knees if it's set high enough. I'd expect a 25%-35% improvement in FPS with an R9 390 at the same settings.It seems like a lot of money to spend just to be able to have faster RAM and overclock a CPU he doesn't have yet. If you're buying new RAM/Mobo/CPU why not at least wait until you can go Skylake?GTX 970 for your price range.Because the PSU upgrade is strong recommendation to OC, and a light recommendation either way, considering its voltage regulation tolerances.RAM seems unnecessary but ok.Unless you're doing extreme overclocking, the motherboard doesn't matter that much. Just get something with the ports you need/want.1155, 1150, 1151 are all pretty close. Just don't get a Scythe brand until they resolve the bending issues.MSI Twin Frozr/Asus Strix cards have a silent mode.PSU cables work with any motherboard, but not with any PSU.

Which EVGA power supply do you have?

EVGA makes their own aftermarket cables, compatible with SuperNOVA (not NEX) G2/T2/P2 series:

http://www.scan.co.uk/products/evga-red-braided-individually-sleeved-power-supply-cable-set-for-g2-p2-t2-series
When we get close to consoles having 16GB.Some of them. Depends on the cooler the card uses, and the overclock, if any. Depends on if you're capping FPS too. If you're having the card work as hard as it can generating high FPS then it'll work harder, but new cards don't need to work that hard to do 120fps in CS:GO.I'd look into a GTX 960 or R9 380 that reviews say run cool.Try manually uninstalling your network driver and installing a Win 10 compatible LAN driver. Windows 10 tries to find a driver that works when you upgrade but sometimes it fails and either keeps your Win 7 one or downloads a new Win 7 one that doesn't work well.Make sure you update the firmware on that SSD.

Assuming a 400EUR budget:

It seems like there are passive coolers for CPUs up to like 95W, I think you'll be ok.

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/zalman-cpu-cooler-fx70

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/xigmatek-cpu-cooler-thorshammer126384wIf you're not getting an overclocking i7, why not get the Xeon e3-1231v3 instead? It's exactly the same CPU as the i7-4770 with the integrated graphics disabled and a marginally slower turbo speed (-0.1Ghz) for $50 less.

As for the case, do you mean a case that's Black and White or "black or white"? Do you prefer windows/no windows? Aggressive styling or restrained?

So then 410 EUR leftover for card + PSU?Are you comfortable overclocking? Both of these builds are paying extra for overclocking features, money could be saved/used elsewhere if you're not going to use it.

Just because a case can fit 10 fans doesn't mean you need 9 case fans. 3-4 is usually enough. More than 5-6 contributes little and adds to clutter/noise.http://pcpartpicker.com/part/phanteks-case-phes515pbk

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/prolimatech-cpu-cooler-prosam17

On a 35W CPU, I think you can do it. One reviewer one Newegg writes:

&gt;Originally bought this cooler to be used in my media center with a fan attached. After installing it I didn't have enough room to mount even a slim 120mm fan and still close my case. To my surprise leaving the system on over a long weekend with the AC off in Texas the system never hit over 48*C running a CPU intensive benchmark. This was done on a i3 3220

That's a 55W CPU.&gt;  corsair 540

It's a good case. No shortage of good options.Well, if you're going to overclock, it's probably best to just pick one up  that can so you don't have to pay even more to switch to one that can later. If you won't ever then don't pay for it.Should be ok. I've done it on an Athlon 64 x2 5000 @ 2.6GHz from 2008 and I guarantee the Pentium is faster.https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff553572(v=vs.85).aspx

I can't point you to the correct drivers unless you say what motherboard you have, I assume you're on wired internet?then yeah go with the build I posted above.All the monitor has to do is support the minimum version to run at its max resolution/display rate. It will be able to do 1080p 144Hz. That monitor is a year older than DP 1.3 so probably DP 1.2

DP 1.3 wouldn't give it anything extra, but go ahead and get a compatible cable. No point in buying old cables when they're backwards compatible.

&gt; i5 &gt; i7 for gaming

Huh? Only from a value perspective.

Even OC'd 760s should be a little bit slower than a GTX 980, looking at their processing power. An overclocked 980 will definitely be faster.

OP, 2nding what this guy says about fixing the fps issues. Something is up and it's probably fixable.Looks fine except for the DVD drives, I assume you went with that RAM because it's black and 1866 otherwise there's cheaper options.Like I said, only from a value perspective. But without that context it sounds like you're saying the i5 is better, which it's not. i7s also have larger L3 cache + the same or higher stock/boost clocks. Black, faster, cheaper:

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231959whoops, wrong PcPartPicker sort settings. There's no black cheaper at that speed but there is blue:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gskill-memory-f32400c11d8gxm

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-memory-bls2k4g3d18ads3j

Or DDR3-1600 in black:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gskill-memory-f31600c11d8gnscheck out /r/TrueFilm or /r/FlicksMost of the movies you mention had ok reviews, not great reviews.

A lot of stuff doesn't hold up to repeat viewings, whereas first viewings they can rely on spectacle and hype, or the thrill of seeing things in a theater with other viewers.Your load temps seem fine, idle temp depends on your fan curves and case airflow. Some cards like to idle the fans lower to stay quieter. Your temps are a little high for idle but not going to cause any damage. 

Here are benchmarking results with the same GPU, their idle was a little lower but their load temp a smidge higher: https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Powercolor/R9_390_PCS_Plus/34.html

If you'd like to lower it, your case only has one 120mm output fan but room for ~~four~~ six more case fans. Grab two 120mm fans for the front or bottom and a 140mm for the top and you'll be a lot cooler. You don't need to fill the case but at least 2-3 more would help.

EDIT: idk why but a lot of the specs for this case online are wrong:

**Actual fan spots**

Top: 2x 120mm/140mm (not included)

Rear: 1x 120mm (included)

Bottom: 1x 120mm (not included)

Front: 2x 120mm (not included)

Side: 1x 120mm (not included)
There's not a lot of data yet because they just came out with a new driver package, called "Crimson". Their previous driver setup was called "Catalyst".

Crimson seems pretty slick, but I imagine only time will tell. A few people are reporting issues with it but that's normal with any large release.I would advise not getting such a crappy power supply, I can suggest a better one if I know your budget and region.

It will have no problem with Minecraft (recording probably ok too), and older games.

However, if you let us know your total budget we could also potentially recommend a cheaper, better option.Don't advertise your stream here.That's DDR4 RAM and a DDR3 Motherboard, so no, not compatible. Swapped you out. It's a little cheaper.

Also switched your GTX 970 to a faster, cooler, quieter model for under $10 more.

Power supply is not great, found a pretty good semi-modular 520W one for only $5 more in MSY's list.

I made sure the prices matched MSY (WHO PUTS THEIR PRICING IN A PDF ONLY?)

All this stuff will play nicely together, including fitting:

Where are you getting that motherboard so cheap? That definitely sweetens the deal a lot but I'm thrown.

RAM is overpriced.

Power supply is ok but you can do much better for the price.

GPU-wise the GTX 950 isn't a great deal right now. You can get an equivalent AMD card, the R7 270, for much cheaper, and it comes with a free game.

(Your build suggests you know what you're doing but I have to ask)What is your total Chrome memory usage?Run [UserBenchmark](http://www.userbenchmark.com/) with all other programs closed. Should only take a minute or two. I have a suspicion that could verify for me.Yeah, probably the card.You don't need a CD drive for the drivers, they don't get installed until Windows is up and newer windows versions usually have no problem getting a basic network driver running to let you download more. (If not, you'll have to USB drive it)

With regard to the GPU, can you reseat it in its slot and make sure the PCIe power connectors from the power supply are plugged in?

Also, that is not a good power supply. Don't go cheapo on your power supply. Apevia makes poorly regulated LED-light crap. Good 700W power supplies don't regularly cost $40. It could be the cause of your issue, hard to say.Although he'll need a new power supply with an R9 380...not that an upgrade there would hurt.It's not what I thought it was, but you do have a problem. It's showing that your CPU is downclocking to 1.45GHz from 3.3GHz, that could happen for a number of reasons but the most common is thermal throttling. Can you check your CPU temps with Open Hardware Monitor or MSI Afterburner?

If temps are the problem you may have a bad CPU cooler fan, or it's getting bad contact between the CPU and the cooler, or it's clogged full of dust, or your case temps are too high (probably not the last one since your other components seem fine).

The good news is I think your RAM and GPU are ok.What /u/Stwyde saidThey're fine, although you may not get the best prices limiting yourself to one store. If that's not the actual price of that motherboard, I think I could advise something better. Let me throw together a Micro Center-only build real quick.

Is the fan even spinning?Not classy, Apevia. If they forgot/skimped on that, I think you can deduce their general level of standards. You can play many AAA games on only 4GB of RAM, although I'd advise 8GB.Since you have a Z87 motherboard, I would recommend updating your BIOS prior to installing the 4790K. The 4790K is part of the "Haswell refresh" that was released later, so the update may be needed to support it on the older Z87 motherboard.I mean, there's faster stuff out there than dual crossfire 280x, but what resolution/games/fps are you playing? If you're getting good performance as it is, then what's the point?What parts inside have lights on and fans spinning? How are you hooked up to your monitor? How long is the cable? Can you try another one?Kerbal at 60fps should be no problem unless you have a super high res monitor.

You're missing a PSU, so I added one.

Instead of 4x4GB RAM, go with 2x8GB RAM. Cheaper, and you'll still get dual channel for editing tasks.

I'd suggest an H97 motherboard instead, the Z has overclocking turned on which you don't need with that CPU. Is there any other reason you chose that motherboard? It's a bit spendy.

Also for the price you're paying you're better off with an R9 380. Tried to keep your black/red color scheme with my selections:

It's probably fine but you never know. The other two are probably ok. Also recommending /r/hardwareswap, which has its own rep system.Recommending a nicer power supply for this expensive of a build, Corsair CX series is hit-or-miss, and people have fried them especially with an overclocking system like yours. They're more for budget builds that are less demanding.Also recommending a better power supply, people have horror stories with the CX series and R9s pull a lot of juice.A VGA cable? So you're using a DVI to VGA adapter? That's a relevant piece of information. The DVI port on that video card is DVI-D, which means it does not support analog (VGA) adapters.Yeah I think an R9 390 is the way to go, barring a good sale on a GTX 970 or GTX 980. There's also good prices on the last of the R9 290s if you want to save some cash.Whoops, well, besides that do you have any response to my questions?

Acquire the proper cabling to hook up your monitor or TV to your video card, or use that HDMI you hooked up to the TV with.Yes. Looks fine. You could also go with an Intel i3 build, which I think will be faster in most games despite only having 2 cores with hyperthreading. This build also saves you about \u00a320 while upgrading your power supply. Either way I think you should go with this power supply.

Always feels good getting your new build going.This is pretty ambitious if you've never built a PC before. Do you have machining experience and access to a laser or waterjet cutter? Experience with electronics? Experience with CAD software? "Building a PC as in assembling the components into a case isn't the hard part, it's all the custom materials and such. The waterblocks for the custom liquid cooling would also be a little advanced for a first-timer.Maybe try running Windows update? Or just download the latest driver from the www.nvidia.com instead of the one on the disk.Good call, forgot those were bad news:

If you're saying you'd like to find an existing case that vaguely resembles this look, that you could probably do, but it won't be cheap.Yes, but OP has to learn how to remove a GPU cooler and add the waterblock, and make sure they buy the correct model for the waterblock. It's a custom water cooling setup (i.e. not a prebought closed-loop or kit), not custom parts.Good enough power supply. Either 8GB or 16GB of RAM. Any reason for the expensive ATX case when you've got a microATX motherboard?No, but you could probably get a good case for less if it's micro, less wasted space on your desk. Also a fan of a more "restrained" case. If you're not married to that specific one, mind if I do a proposed build with another case?Whatever, preference is fine. The 970 is definitely a little bit slower than the 390 in some games but it overclocks well, uses about 100W less during gaming, and depending on model will be quieter. Running the MSI GTX 970 Twin Frozr myself, but get whatever's cheap with good reviews.I'm telling you you're going to need at least some of those skills, but feel free to try!Ok, also tried to switch out a few parts for cheaper equivalents that won't hurt performance so that I could upgrade to an R9 390. Suggested a new power supply because the CX series isn't great. Basically for the same price this should be faster and more robust:

Or just buy a microATX motherboard to be safe.No to your headline, yes to your body paragraph.That power supply line is cheap but generally bad news, with a build like this you could afford to do better. Also swapped for slightly cheaper RAM. Better, cheaper wifi card. Consider switching to an R9 390 video card.

It's cheaper so if you're not overclocking yes.What output does your laptop have?Samsung 850 EVO or Crucial MX200/BX100So if the parts aren't in the case, where are they?It makes it faster, but it's more work and could shorten part lifespan.The switch on the power supply doesn't turn the computer on, it only turns the power supply on. Hook your motherboard up to the on switch on your case or short the power supply switch pins on your motherboard.i5 Haswell + H97 motherboard or i5 Skylake with H170 motherboard.Turn the PSU on, wait a while, then turn the motherboard on. Don't turn off the PSU all the time, only when you're working on the PC.Rest of your components are still fine. I just went from a 560Ti 448 (baby 570 with some cores turned off) to a GTX 970 myself.

What is your power supply and what case do you have? If the PSU is below 600W, get the GTX 970, if it's above 600W get the R9 390, just make sure the length fits in your case.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-01 14:03 EST-0500 |I'd go with the R9 390 then, but the GTX 970 is good too if you prefer Nvidia.Looks fine to me if you're planning on overclocking. The Western Digital Black hard drive is kinda overkill if you've already got an SSD, the Blue is fast enough, but that's up to you.Yeah the Corsair CX series is subpar. That you already owned the CPU would have been relevant info to provide up front.Yes. It's not very hard, disconnect the PSU cables, undo the screws holding the GPU in in the back, lift the retaining clip on the PCIe slot, pull it out. Google a system building guide if you need help.You would uninstall your current drivers and install the AMD drivers. (Firmware lives on the GPU itself and is the liason between the hardware and the drivers)You're getting an overclockable CPU in either build, might as well go with the Z97 motherboard so you can overclock it. You can overclock a little with the stock cooler but you're gonna want an aftermarket cooler.Have your friend run a [UserBenchmark](http://www.userbenchmark.com), this might be able to pinpoint the component causing the issues.

I'd recommend reseating the graphics card as well, and checking all the power supply connectors to make sure nothing got knocked loose.You'll always get more for your money if you wait.What's the power supply in her computer?It sounds like your fan is messed up and possibly rubbing against itself or a cable in your case, maybe?
You could save $10 on the RAM:
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-memory-bls2k4g3d169ds1j

I think this PSU is a better deal right now: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-power-supply-rs550amaag1s1Did you buy it or did she? If you did can you look in your email history for the order?Probably not too bad but maybe a little aliased.What happens if you reboot and try it again?Not that I know of. You could find out the brand from the outside of the back maybe. Nvidia-wise you could get a GTX 970 for the whole $300 or a 960 for about $180-200, just get any model with good reviews on Newegg. Nvidia is also a safer bet from a power supply perspective, they use less juice.

The 550Ti uses about 116W, about the same as the GTX 960 (120W). The R9 380 is rated at 190W.In most games, absolutely none. In the most demanding of games, a slight difference, especially if you have other programs open. If you do anything like rendering/encoding, some difference.Yeah that's not a bad idea for MMOs. A Hyper 212 EVO will do the trick.I'd buy 1x8GB now so if I want to upgrade to 16GB later I have a slot free. Some motherboards have 4 slots, but since you didn't tell us which one I can't say more.Just a bug then, or some weirdness from the recent install.Wow yeah something's up with the CPU. You mentioned checking GPU temps but what about CPU? Could it be that the CPU cooler is no longer seating properly so it's thermal throttling?

Whatever that thing he downloaded sounds...interesting?It's possible the tool is disabling processor throttling, which may not be good if it's a cooling issue.

What's wrong with the results from your system? I see you had high ambient load. If you do have high ambient CPU load all the time that could hurt you but you probably had a browser with flash running or something updating in the background. Try rebooting, letting everything load, then rerunning the userbenchmark exe.Can you pull it out? It sounds like it's stripped. Maybe try unscrewing while pulling on it?Looks good, but there are cheaper R9 390s out there.Save $10 by going with this CPU:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i34130

Everything else looks good to me.I think he means "will it cause the GPU to be the bottleneck"? Bottleneck doesn't exclusively refer to CPU.

OP, If your power supply can handle it the R9 380 4GB would be a good GPU option too.It it just on the side panel or through to the case?It's still not going to make it noticeably faster.Especially on a G2I'm not saying that it bottlenecks the CPU, it becomes the bottleneck for the system, by being the limiting factor from having higher frame rates.

That's what bottleneck means, the narrowest flow point preventing faster flow.You don't need a separate video card if you're not gaming with the machine. You can use the video integrated onto the CPU. This also means you can probably go cheaper on the power supply too. A 300W would suffice.

You save money by buying one that has both. With the leftover $$ you could pick up a small SSD for the OS, it should really speed the machine up. If 240GB is big enough you could even ditch the regular hard drive.

Extrapolate that to more demanding programs and you get the idea. Plus they use very little power, are silent, and generate negligible heat.Hm, yeah don't. It's probably coarse threaded instead of fine threaded, but the holes are tapped for fine thread. Do you have any spares that came with it? Maybe that screw is for something else on the case.A little bit but I wouldn't try breaking any records. The 390 OC could add up to 30W, the CPU one could tack on 70W at 4.8Ghz, putting you at the limit. Maybe just a little bit.Don't assume anything is obvious when you're responding to someone asking for computer help on the internet. You're getting into the weeds. There are multiple modes of bottlenecks occurring whether at the top or bottom of the pipeline we both know this.

He's asking if the 2GB of VRAM will bottleneck the card's output (by forcing it to swap textures in and out of VRAM), and the answer is ["in rare occasions, or at resolutions over 1080p, yes"](http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/1888-evga-supersc-4gb-960-benchmark-vs-2gb) but if you're at 1080p or below maybe not worth the extra cost.Yeah ok dude.There's a setting in the Nvidia Control Panel under the 3d settings-&gt;Manage 3d settings tab where you can apply settings to a particular game. Turn "power management mode" for those games to "prefer maximum performance". This will prevent the GPU from chilling out because it thinks it can handle the game no problem.

You could also use this setting globally if you want.Solid except for the power supply. Recommending something a little better-made instead:

Non-modular, a step above what you have but still on the cheap side, ~$20 after rebate right now, $40 usually:
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-100b10500kr

Non-modular, good brand~$50
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-s12ii520bronze

semi-Modular, Nice, $40 after rebate http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-110b20750vr

semi-modular, Nice, $50 after rebate http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-power-supply-rs550amaag1s1Yes, there's only one USB 3.0 front panel header on the motherboard, but it will split into two USB 3.0 front ports.No, the case front panel will just have one big plug, the splitting is built into the front panel wiring.Good Guy NIMBY?Yeah, the art of power supply picking is knowing which OEM actually built it for the company and then looking at reviews, plus considering sale prices. Some good resources:

http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.html

http://www.realhardtechx.com/index_archivos/PSUReviewDatabase.html

http://www.orionpsudb.com/It looks about where it should be.

Try [UserBenchmark](http://www.userbenchmark.com/), it directly compares your components to other people with the same components.

As a side note, why'd you buy an overclockable CPU but not an overclocking motherboard?They'd probably want to upgrade their PSU as well then, because the R9 390 would put them at over 400W under high gaming load, with peaks higher than that. Which in turn might not make the R9 worth it. The 970 uses about 100W less under load.Yeah don't get a CX series. Every build comes in here with a CX series, they are not very good.OP, yes this has 2 RAM slots.

I agree for the price a Skylake build probably makes sense. 

Although in practice I've never upgraded my CPU on the same motherboard, being able to save $30-$80 by porting over your RAM is nice.

I think in benchmarks even [the 2.7Ghz i5-6400 beats the i5-4460 by a small margin](http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-6400-vs-Intel-Core-i5-4460/3512vs2310). Motherboard you may have to fork over a little more for, RAM will be a smidge more.

It seems like the additional cost in the short term may offset whatever price savings in RAM you'd receive from being able to reuse it, but it's a decent CPU performance bump so do what you want.
Huh, didn't realize or forgot about that bit of news. Cool!First off, it's saying you have a 48% ambient CPU load, which means programs are running in the background. 50% of an i7? That's a lot of juice! Do a reboot or just close stuff before you run it.

The 5% below average is 5% below the score of all GTX 980s tested on the site, not just your specific model. Your model's overclock might be lower than the average 980 user of UserBenchmark.  It's saying that 77% of GTX 980s scored better than you. Since you have a slight overclock on your card I'd expect you to be nearer to the average. Your CPU utilization is probably at fault.Ok, that'll do for either the R9 380 or the GTX 960. 

[These are all the models below 10" long with 4GB of RAM, pick the cheapest one with good reviews.](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/video-card/#c=208,310&amp;sort=a8&amp;page=1&amp;l=69,256&amp;r=8192,6144,4096) My vote is still for the Powercolor R9 380 from Amazon with no rebate for $200.
Huh? It looks like your CPU scored higher to me! 99.9% at the 50th percentile vs 94.1% at the 12th percentile. In other words, your i7 is now performing perfectly average.

So here's your GPU data points:

GPU stock w/ high ambient CPU load: 23rd percentile

GPU stock: ??? (I'm guessing about 45th percentile)

GPU @ 150Mhz/100Mhz OC: 72nd percentile

As a side note, that 980 must kill at 1600x900 res. My 970 feels like more than enough for my 1680x1050 and that's 22% more pixels.http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/downtown/crime/Newegg and Amazon don't ship fast enough? Newegg usually is like a day or two even if they say longer, their warehouse is in City of Industry.

Fry's though, barring that. Or Microcenter in Tustin.

What kind of hardware do you need?[I guess Tide does contain really small levels of Dioxane, which is cancer-causing.](http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/mothers-challenge-trace-ingredient-in-detergent/?_r=0) It's below legal limits though, nor does this article claim it becomes airborne after use.

Ignoring all the cancer fearmonging, is there another brand of comparable price and performance that's less smelly? Noxious neighbor smells do suck.Actually I thought I was really towing both sides of the line, presenting scientific evidence of the chemicals in Tide while discounting the actual risks associated with Tide's use.

The possibility that your laundry may smell isn't a wacko concept, especially if people's windows are near the dryer exhaust vent. I'm not saying you have to change (and your attitude certainly suggests you won't) but when we're all packed into this metropolis together and you can do something to help others with little to no effort, seems like a neighborly thing to do.Since you have a Z87 motherboard, I would recommend updating your BIOS prior to installing the 4790K. The 4790K is part of the "Haswell refresh" that was released later, so the update may be needed to support it on the older Z87 motherboard.I mean, there's faster stuff out there than dual crossfire 280x, but what resolution/games/fps are you playing? If you're getting good performance as it is, then what's the point?What parts inside have lights on and fans spinning? How are you hooked up to your monitor? How long is the cable? Can you try another one?Kerbal at 60fps should be no problem unless you have a super high res monitor.

You're missing a PSU, so I added one.

Instead of 4x4GB RAM, go with 2x8GB RAM. Cheaper, and you'll still get dual channel for editing tasks.

I'd suggest an H97 motherboard instead, the Z has overclocking turned on which you don't need with that CPU. Is there any other reason you chose that motherboard? It's a bit spendy.

Also for the price you're paying you're better off with an R9 380. Tried to keep your black/red color scheme with my selections:

Acquire the proper cabling to hook up your monitor or TV to your video card, or use that HDMI you hooked up to the TV with.Yes. Looks fine. You could also go with an Intel i3 build, which I think will be faster in most games despite only having 2 cores with hyperthreading. This build also saves you about \u00a320 while upgrading your power supply. Either way I think you should go with this power supply.

Always feels good getting your new build going.This is pretty ambitious if you've never built a PC before. Do you have machining experience and access to a laser or waterjet cutter? Experience with electronics? Experience with CAD software? "Building a PC as in assembling the components into a case isn't the hard part, it's all the custom materials and such. The waterblocks for the custom liquid cooling would also be a little advanced for a first-timer.Maybe try running Windows update? Or just download the latest driver from the www.nvidia.com instead of the one on the disk.Good call, forgot those were bad news:

If you're saying you'd like to find an existing case that vaguely resembles this look, that you could probably do, but it won't be cheap.Yes, but OP has to learn how to remove a GPU cooler and add the waterblock, and make sure they buy the correct model for the waterblock. It's a custom water cooling setup (i.e. not a prebought closed-loop or kit), not custom parts.Good enough power supply. Either 8GB or 16GB of RAM. Any reason for the expensive ATX case when you've got a microATX motherboard?No, but you could probably get a good case for less if it's micro, less wasted space on your desk. Also a fan of a more "restrained" case. If you're not married to that specific one, mind if I do a proposed build with another case?Whatever, preference is fine. The 970 is definitely a little bit slower than the 390 in some games but it overclocks well, uses about 100W less during gaming, and depending on model will be quieter. Running the MSI GTX 970 Twin Frozr myself, but get whatever's cheap with good reviews.I'm telling you you're going to need at least some of those skills, but feel free to try!Ok, also tried to switch out a few parts for cheaper equivalents that won't hurt performance so that I could upgrade to an R9 390. Suggested a new power supply because the CX series isn't great. Basically for the same price this should be faster and more robust:

Crucial SSDs are great, been running on the predecessor of this one for almost 2 years now (MX100).  Performance-wise not quite as fast as the 850 EVO, but if you need to save a few bucks somewhere, it's a good place to do it. I don't think you'd be able to tell the difference in use.How about this?

Or just buy a microATX motherboard to be safe.No to your headline, yes to your body paragraph.That power supply line is cheap but generally bad news, with a build like this you could afford to do better. Also swapped for slightly cheaper RAM. Better, cheaper wifi card. Consider switching to an R9 390 video card.

Hook your motherboard up to the on switch on your case or short the power supply switch pins on your motherboard.i5 Haswell + H97 motherboard or i5 Skylake with H170 motherboard.Turn the PSU on, wait a while, then turn the motherboard on. Don't turn off the PSU all the time, only when you're working on the PC.Rest of your components are still fine. I just went from a 560Ti 448 (baby 570 with some cores turned off) to a GTX 970 myself.

What is your power supply and what case do you have? If the PSU is below 600W, get the GTX 970, if it's above 600W get the R9 390, just make sure the length fits in your case.

The Western Digital Black hard drive is kinda overkill if you've already got an SSD, the Blue is fast enough, but that's up to you.Yeah the Corsair CX series is subpar. That you already owned the CPU would have been relevant info to provide up front.Yes. It's not very hard, disconnect the PSU cables, undo the screws holding the GPU in in the back, lift the retaining clip on the PCIe slot, pull it out. Google a system building guide if you need help.You would uninstall your current drivers and install the AMD drivers. (Firmware lives on the GPU itself and is the liason between the hardware and the drivers)You're getting an overclockable CPU in either build, might as well go with the Z97 motherboard so you can overclock it. You can overclock a little with the stock cooler but you're gonna want an aftermarket cooler.Have your friend run a [UserBenchmark](http://www.userbenchmark.com), this might be able to pinpoint the component causing the issues.

I'd recommend reseating the graphics card as well, and checking all the power supply connectors to make sure nothing got knocked loose.You'll always get more for your money if you wait.What's the power supply in her computer?It sounds like your fan is messed up and possibly rubbing against itself or a cable in your case, maybe?
You could save $10 on the RAM:
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-memory-bls2k4g3d169ds1j

I think this PSU is a better deal right now: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-power-supply-rs550amaag1s1Did you buy it or did she? If you did can you look in your email history for the order?Probably not too bad but maybe a little aliased.What happens if you reboot and try it again?Not that I know of. You could find out the brand from the outside of the back maybe. Nvidia-wise you could get a GTX 970 for the whole $300 or a 960 for about $180-200, just get any model with good reviews on Newegg. Nvidia is also a safer bet from a power supply perspective, they use less juice.

The 550Ti uses about 116W, about the same as the GTX 960 (120W). The R9 380 is rated at 190W.In most games, absolutely none. In the most demanding of games, a slight difference, especially if you have other programs open. If you do anything like rendering/encoding, some difference.Yeah that's not a bad idea for MMOs. A Hyper 212 EVO will do the trick.I'd buy 1x8GB now so if I want to upgrade to 16GB later I have a slot free. Some motherboards have 4 slots, but since you didn't tell us which one I can't say more.Just a bug then, or some weirdness from the recent install.Wow yeah something's up with the CPU. You mentioned checking GPU temps but what about CPU? Could it be that the CPU cooler is no longer seating properly so it's thermal throttling?

Whatever that thing he downloaded sounds...interesting?It's possible the tool is disabling processor throttling, which may not be good if it's a cooling issue.

What's wrong with the results from your system? I see you had high ambient load. If you do have high ambient CPU load all the time that could hurt you but you probably had a browser with flash running or something updating in the background. Try rebooting, letting everything load, then rerunning the userbenchmark exe.Can you pull it out? It sounds like it's stripped. Maybe try unscrewing while pulling on it?Looks good, but there are cheaper R9 390s out there.Save $10 by going with this CPU:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i34130

Everything else looks good to me.I think he means "will it cause the GPU to be the bottleneck"? Bottleneck doesn't exclusively refer to CPU.

OP, If your power supply can handle it the R9 380 4GB would be a good GPU option too.It it just on the side panel or through to the case?It's still not going to make it noticeably faster.Especially on a G2I'm not saying that it bottlenecks the CPU, it becomes the bottleneck for the system, by being the limiting factor from having higher frame rates.

That's what bottleneck means, the narrowest flow point preventing faster flow.You don't need a separate video card if you're not gaming with the machine. You can use the video integrated onto the CPU. This also means you can probably go cheaper on the power supply too. A 300W would suffice.

You save money by buying one that has both. With the leftover $$ you could pick up a small SSD for the OS, it should really speed the machine up. If 240GB is big enough you could even ditch the regular hard drive.

Extrapolate that to more demanding programs and you get the idea. Plus they use very little power, are silent, and generate negligible heat.Hm, yeah don't. It's probably coarse threaded instead of fine threaded, but the holes are tapped for fine thread. Do you have any spares that came with it? Maybe that screw is for something else on the case.A little bit but I wouldn't try breaking any records. The 390 OC could add up to 30W, the CPU one could tack on 70W at 4.8Ghz, putting you at the limit. Maybe just a little bit.Don't assume anything is obvious when you're responding to someone asking for computer help on the internet. You're getting into the weeds. There are multiple modes of bottlenecks occurring whether at the top or bottom of the pipeline we both know this.

He's asking if the 2GB of VRAM will bottleneck the card's output (by forcing it to swap textures in and out of VRAM), and the answer is ["in rare occasions, or at resolutions over 1080p, yes"](http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/1888-evga-supersc-4gb-960-benchmark-vs-2gb) but if you're at 1080p or below maybe not worth the extra cost.Yeah ok dude.There's a setting in the Nvidia Control Panel under the 3d settings-&gt;Manage 3d settings tab where you can apply settings to a particular game. Turn "power management mode" for those games to "prefer maximum performance". This will prevent the GPU from chilling out because it thinks it can handle the game no problem.

You could also use this setting globally if you want.Solid except for the power supply. Recommending something a little better-made instead:

Some good resources:

http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.html

http://www.realhardtechx.com/index_archivos/PSUReviewDatabase.html

http://www.orionpsudb.com/It looks about where it should be.

Try [UserBenchmark](http://www.userbenchmark.com/), it directly compares your components to other people with the same components.

As a side note, why'd you buy an overclockable CPU but not an overclocking motherboard?They'd probably want to upgrade their PSU as well then, because the R9 390 would put them at over 400W under high gaming load, with peaks higher than that. Which in turn might not make the R9 worth it. The 970 uses about 100W less under load.Yeah don't get a CX series. Every build comes in here with a CX series, they are not very good.OP, yes this has 2 RAM slots.

I agree for the price a Skylake build probably makes sense. 

Although in practice I've never upgraded my CPU on the same motherboard, being able to save $30-$80 by porting over your RAM is nice.

I think in benchmarks even [the 2.7Ghz i5-6400 beats the i5-4460 by a small margin](http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-6400-vs-Intel-Core-i5-4460/3512vs2310). Motherboard you may have to fork over a little more for, RAM will be a smidge more.

It seems like the additional cost in the short term may offset whatever price savings in RAM you'd receive from being able to reuse it, but it's a decent CPU performance bump so do what you want.
Huh, didn't realize or forgot about that bit of news. Cool!First off, it's saying you have a 48% ambient CPU load, which means programs are running in the background. 50% of an i7? That's a lot of juice! Do a reboot or just close stuff before you run it.

The 5% below average is 5% below the score of all GTX 980s tested on the site, not just your specific model. Your model's overclock might be lower than the average 980 user of UserBenchmark.  It's saying that 77% of GTX 980s scored better than you. Since you have a slight overclock on your card I'd expect you to be nearer to the average. Your CPU utilization is probably at fault.Ok, that'll do for either the R9 380 or the GTX 960. 

[These are all the models below 10" long with 4GB of RAM, pick the cheapest one with good reviews.](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/video-card/#c=208,310&amp;sort=a8&amp;page=1&amp;l=69,256&amp;r=8192,6144,4096) My vote is still for the Powercolor R9 380 from Amazon with no rebate for $200.
Huh? It looks like your CPU scored higher to me! 99.9% at the 50th percentile vs 94.1% at the 12th percentile. In other words, your i7 is now performing perfectly average.

So here's your GPU data points:

GPU stock w/ high ambient CPU load: 23rd percentile

GPU stock: ??? (I'm guessing about 45th percentile)

GPU @ 150Mhz/100Mhz OC: 72nd percentile

As a side note, that 980 must kill at 1600x900 res. My 970 feels like more than enough for my 1680x1050 and that's 22% more pixels.http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/downtown/crime/Newegg and Amazon don't ship fast enough? Newegg usually is like a day or two even if they say longer, their warehouse is in City of Industry.

Fry's though, barring that. Or Microcenter in Tustin.

What kind of hardware do you need?[I guess Tide does contain really small levels of Dioxane, which is cancer-causing.](http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/mothers-challenge-trace-ingredient-in-detergent/?_r=0) It's below legal limits though, nor does this article claim it becomes airborne after use.

Ignoring all the cancer fearmonging, is there another brand of comparable price and performance that's less smelly? Noxious neighbor smells do suck.Actually I thought I was really towing both sides of the line, presenting scientific evidence of the chemicals in Tide while discounting the actual risks associated with Tide's use.

The possibility that your laundry may smell isn't a wacko concept, especially if people's windows are near the dryer exhaust vent. I'm not saying you have to change (and your attitude certainly suggests you won't) but when we're all packed into this metropolis together and you can do something to help others with little to no effort, seems like a neighborly thing to do.Your system should be able to play these games at high/ultra settings. Which R9 200 series do you have? Also what is your hard drive and power supply situation? (open it up and look at the square box inside for the power supply brand and model #)

If your computer sounds like it's making a racket and shutting itself off, is the racket a mechanical sound or more of a digital tone? If it's the first one, maybe one of your fans is failing and it's not able to cool properly, eventually leading to crashes or system shutdown?I assume fans are spinning and lights are turning on? 

Many motherboards disable onboard graphics when they detect a discrete graphics card. Try removing your graphics card and then booting.If anything I'd say underboard. If your primary use is gaming (and not just cpu-heavy games like MMOs) then an i3 and a more expensive GPU would be faster. For &lt;=1080p gaming either is fine though.2nding getting a better PSU.Between ~0% and 80% fps gains, depending on game. Slightly more microstuttering.That ram is the cheapest right now for 16GB DDR3.

I agree on the PSU though:

What's your budget?What are your motherboard and CPU?What's your power supply? If it's beefy enough to support any of those graphics cards then any will do, current price/performance favorite is 390, followed by 970, then 390x, the 980. If value doesn't matter and you just want the fastest then the 390x and 980 are pretty neck and neck but the 980 is slightly faster.&gt; AMD X4 860k

Your CPU is model variant of the A10-7850K with the integrated graphics disabled and sold at a lower price, which is why you're not getting any video. Wait for your correct GPU cable to show up.Yes, no graphics chip on the CPU, everything probably works fine.That will probably be holding the R9 390X back, that's like 2-3 tiers up from your current 960 selection.$500 will more than do the trick, you could keep your current RAM if you choose to get a DDR3 motherboard. Do you plan on/want to overclock?Yeah or if you can drive out to City of Industry you can pick it up at Newegg's warehouse/showroom. The showroom is pretty cool, 4k monitors hooked up to beastly PCs that you can try out.That'll handle any of those.Yeah as /u/SonicSlayer says. The i3 + 390x could be faster in CPU-light games, but the i5 + 390 makes more sense as a build and should deliver more consistent performance.RTSes like Starcraft are one of the types of games that benefit from a good CPU (lots of units and pathing), I'd say go with the i5.It's not at all necessary, but it can get you higher performance for less money.

The Corsair CX series uses lower-quality components/cheaper manufacturer. Since that's the bit that powers the rest and you're planning on OCing, so get something nicer, like this one:
http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-s12ii520bronze.

The newer Skylake series of Intel CPUs might be about the same price now so I'd look at that. 

With regard to your mom not letting you spend the money, I'd suggest you enlist your dad's help if possible (you didn't say if they're on good terms). Do you know what hobbies she'd let you spend money on because she considers those culturally "normal"? Such as working on cars, or hunting, etc. Emphasize that it's both a hobby and a career tool, a good computer to code on? Maybe get a debit card? It doesn't take much time.

I'd also suggest you go with a MicroATX or MiniITX build. As a college student you'll have less room and the smaller the case, the better.All of these GTX 960s have 2 DVI, 1 HDMI:

http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/video-card/#xcx=0&amp;c=208&amp;D=2,4&amp;H=1,3

http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=Property&amp;Subcategory=48&amp;N=100007709%20600007835%20600007836%20600007837%20600106703%20600106604%20600031507%20601107672&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;IsPowerSearch=1

Filtering options are easy to use, check them out.

Or just buy a DP-&gt;HDMI adapter.Is there a glaring problem of the cheaper 960 besides the blower-style cooler? OP's choice is $25 cheaper after rebates with slightly lower clock/mem OC.

I agree on the PSU swap. That one is ok but would suggest these two slightly pricier ones too:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-power-supply-rs550amaag1s1

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-s12ii520bronze

Case I'd countersuggest this one: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-case-nse200kkn1, since OP picked one without a window and has a MicroATX mobo.It's probable it's not about you at all then, it's about your dad and the fact that she's projecting her feelings about him onto you, especially as you're sharing his interests. His intervention is the last thing you want then.http://pcpartpicker.com/part/amd-cpu-ad860kxbjabox is almost the same CPU with the integrated GPU disabled and 100Mhz slower, $10 cheaper.

The power supply you're getting what you pay for.It's a guess (the projecting part, not the "it's not you" part). I don't imagine it'd be productive to mention it to her.repostPC monitors are generally lower-latency than LCD TVs, they don't do any processing besides scaling non-native resolutions.

Color accuracy and black levels can be close. I'd recommend a Dell Ultrasharp or an HP z-series/DreamColor or similar using an IPS-style panel. They're more expensive than a cheap TN-style LCD panel.

That image you linked is 4800x4280, you had a CRT that could show that fullscreen? 8k Monitors are just showing up that could do that but will be $$$. On a still-very-spendy 5k like [this Dell Ultrasharp](http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Monitor-UP2715K-27-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00OKSFXZU) or [the 27" iMac](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac) it would fit the long ways but not the other way. Gaming at that resolution would need a real beast of a GPU setup though.

It sounds like a QHD/4k professional-grade monitor with wide color gamut strikes a good balance for you. Tom's Hardware made [a decent list](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/top-best-computer-monitors,3917.html#p5)What are your full system specs?This system holds up just fine. Your GPU is still nearly top-of-the-line but will still be the thing you'll want to upgrade in 2 years barring any massive CPU tech breakthroughs.Your friend's system for EUR 400 only needs a new GPU to be able to play those games well (But ARK runs like crap even expensive PCs I hear), but your dad's build only needs a few more parts and is free.

Why don't you tally up the total pricing of each build to get it in an ideal place?

Well good, because otherwise there's barely a reason to bump up from the i3.Depending on what his power supply is. OP, what's your power supply?At the 950/370 level 2GB/4GB VRAM doesn't matter as much.Ah, I see. What's your budget?

If you're doing a clean install why not just install directly to the SSD from the DVD/USB drive? What do you mean from the old WD Blue? I don't understand. Moving the Windows installation from the HDD is the opposite of a clean install.How did you install 8.1 originally?Don't skimp and get that power supply, better quality stuff out there.

Plus you need to move the installer to something bootable anyways?Ok yeah if you have another computer or whatever that works.I mean that you have to install Windows from something bootable. You can't install Windows from inside your other install of Windows, to my knowledge. This link explains what you have to do, you can use that flash drive once you're done with it.

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-mediaIt should if you don't provide a link to the build you said you made.I think you'd be better off with an i3 or cheaper i5-6400 and a nicer GPU, maybe a GTX 950/960 for the low heat generation.First off, you're buying a graphics card that is too low-end to to be worth buying. At that point you could save money by switching to a Skylake i3 with built-in graphics (when that comes out), or even to the A10-7850K, which is your same CPU with the integrated graphics enabled, they're roughly the same or better than that GPU. Or get a better GPU instead.

The CPU cooler you've selected is too tall for that specific case. There are microATX cases that will fit that cooler but not that one. Or just pick a different cooler.

Also recommending a higher-quality PSU. Those have...mixed reviews.How about this?

The problem is that going with a DDR2 board relegates you to old motherboards, which means old CPUs. You don't want an old CPU, as about 4 years ago at the same time DDR3 succeeded DDR2, Intel CPUs got a lot better. Now the newest motherboards are DDR4. 

Your power supply is probably fine, as long it can support both of those graphics cards.

Don't worry so much about CPU clock speed, AMD 4GHz doesn't mean the same as Intel 4Ghz. Intels are faster clock for clock, unlike the old days.

I'd recommend a Skylake i5, get the -K if you want to overclock. If you get the K, get a Z170 chipset motherboard, otherwise get an H170. Ditch your old RAM and get 8 or 16GB of DDR4. Make sure the motherboard you get is DDR4 compatible, there are still new DDR3 ones being made.To get the drivers or to install Windows?SSD first. Some brands come with a free migration tool that makes it really easy. Just need to get your used space on the HDD lower than the SSD size by moving documents/music/movies/steam game folder to an external, then use the tool provided. I know Intel and Crucial both provide these, I think Samsung too, maybe some others.

I'd recommend a CPU/motherboard upgrade in your future and to get more RAM then, you're probably ok for now if you aren't a Chrome tab monster while gaming.&gt; You mean the quantity of RAM sticks?

Not quantity of sticks, quantity of RAM. 4GB vs 8GB.

&gt; Does DDR4 require to be installed in parity?

Parity means something else in RAM than how you're using it. Your English is like 1000x better than my Mandarin though, so no big. I think you're trying to ask "Do I have to install it in pairs?"? The answer to that is no. Pairs of RAM sticks does let you run in dual-channel mode but on Intel CPUs that doesn't matter much.Yes the GeForce 210/GT430 are not very good graphics cards. The GTX 550Ti will be a little faster. Do you play games or just work/watch movies?

For Photoshop/Illustrator/server configs the graphics card does not matter very much though. CPU/RAM are more important. An SSD will help too. 

What is your budget in Brazilian Real or US Dollars? What is your power supply and case?&gt; H57

Pretty sure that's DDR3Looks like it. I think anything here would be fine:
http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/parts/memory/#sort=a10&amp;page=1&amp;Z=8192001,8192002Yes, it's a bad idea. Hot air goes up, aside from the crossflow issues. Is there some reason you can't just flip the fan around and make both top ones exhaust?Even with the low power version of the i5 you have, you'd be sitting very close to 450W under load with the R9. I'd recommend the GTX 970 in this case. Some of them even turn the fans off when idling/low-level gaming.

Yes, it's insignificant compared to the fan pressure, but you've already got the bottom and top fans creating a flow in that direction, so the result is the same.I wouldn't use VGA, but anything else (HDMI/DVI/Displayport) is fine. VGA means the image is being converted from Digital to Analog and then the monitor is converting it back from Analog to Digital, this can reduce visual quality.

Response time matters but the difference between 12ms and 1ms doesn't matter to most people. I'll let someone from Europe answer the HD ready part.The newer Sentey PSUs are good, made by Super Flower. At least 600W. Cases take your pick.Is your CPU overclocked? If not you can get to 4.0GHz without any overvolting probably, and 4.5GHz with some mild overvolting. I have the same one and finally got around to OCing it to keep up with the times. It's a good CPU.

GPU is the correct upgrade, and an SSD would help with general responsiveness. Your current GPU performs in the range of an Nvidia GTX 750 or AMD R7 260/260X. With a 600W power supply you could bump up to an R9 390 or GTX 970, most people favor the former right now for price/performance.It's a little older model I think, made by Sirtec. Not as nice as the Super Flower ones but pretty good. There's no reviews of it on the internet though.Probably windows being fussy: "We can't let people install it from a slow USB drive or they'll think Windows is slow"

You might be able to get around it by making an ISO from the Windows installer thing (like you're going to burn it to a DVD) and then using a tool like Rufus: https://rufus.akeo.ie/Eh, that's a pretty good price for a 750W. Maybe some EVGA/XFX/Seasonic might come close on sale, but I think you're good.A few things I'd change: high speed RAM isn't really worth it, especially on a low-end system. DDR3-1600 or even DDR3-1333 is fine.

The CX series of Corsair power supplies is their low-end line and not considered very reliable. Plus you can get cheaper and higher-quality, especially after rebate.

If you want to use the money savings to upgrade something, get a small SSD for the OS or bump up the GPU to a R7 370 or GTX 950.

If you must run at max settings 60fps the GTX 970 can get you there (or close to it on the most demanding games), but you might be better off saving up for a 980 or waiting for the next gen to drop.It's either the meteor shower or the reason the military shut down the airspace over the ocean this week.What are you using the machine for? Read the FAQ. We don't know what you should get unless we know the specifics.

You don't need a Z97 if you're not getting an overclockable Intel CPU. Nor do you need to bother with higher-speed DDR3. DDR3-1600 or DDR3-1333 will be $10 cheaper and suffice.

Better PSUs are out there.Well, higher speed RAM is handy when overclocking in a way, but higher speed RAM just doesn't do that much for games.You realize that many ICBMs go into suborbital flight to achieve long-distance flights, yeah? We're talking 750 miles at apogee. That'd be visible for 2,500 miles in either direction according to that equation.

Edit: Reportedly the Trident is capable of even higher apogee, although we can assume it's not at full burn at apogee so less visible, I'd guess it was in the 100-200mile altitude range.Different overclock, different fan. Some are different PCB layouts. Some have different sets of outputs (1 DVI, 2 DisplayPort, 1 HDMI vs 2 DVI, 1 DisplayPort, 1 HDMI, for example).&gt; Overclocking your CPU? It isn't a "K" processor.

Only Sandy Bridge onwards uses the "K" to signify overclockability. His CPU is from a previous generation.

http://www.techreaction.net/2010/09/07/3-step-overclocking-guide-lynnfield/

Overclocking your CPU with the R9 390 on a 550W PSU might be a little dicey. I'd expect you to be around 450W peak before overclocking. If it's a good brand go for it and maybe don't go crazy on the OC.


Had/have a very similar system. The only thing I did to upgrade for recent games is overclock my CPU to 4.0GHz (on a cheapo aftermarket cooler, no overvolt required to get to 4.0, YMMV), and upgrade my GPU.

For $200-250, assuming that's your currency, you could get an R9 380 (~$200) , or wait a few weeks for the R9 380X (~$250) to come out.You have to spend more on the motherboard and PSU for SLI/Crossfire too. It's not economical in most cases, it's just a way to push the high end higher.&gt; i5-760

Yeah this CPU gets power hungry under OC, he's not at max OC though. I'd think maybe another 25-40W. The GPU OC could add another 30W or so.Which ASRock 880GM do you have? 880GM-LE? 880GMH/ U3S3? 880GM-LE FX?

A little more pricey but nicer. Has a VRM heat sink.That budget puts you with either the GTX 960 or the R9 380, unless you spend EUR 320 for the next step up. I vote R9 380 unless you want to spend more and get the GTX 970. The R9 390 is out of the question because you only have a 500W PSU.

Don't worry about PhysX, you won't miss it. You can still run it on the CPU if you want.Mostly looks good. Would recommend one of the following power supplies instead. I know they're not modular but the quality is higher.

An SSD will probably make it fast enough for most desktop/office programs, but for games you're going to need to overhaul that baby. A Core 2 Duo is old now, as is the 9500GT. 4GB of RAM is still passable but 8GB is better.

It's $800, but savings could be had on the motherboard or case.Yeah, any of those should be ok as long as your PSU isn't super old.Your computer is ok. It's faster than most laptops and office PCs but not gonna be any speed demon in games. I agree with /u/Fwistka that a GTX 750Ti is probably the best upgrade you can do, because you're limited by the power supply in your PC.

It should make most of those games playable, although PCSX2 is very demanding in some games, it may not fix that lag entirely.Then you could get a better GPU but then it'd be held back by the CPU anyways.1) AMD only is competitive on the low end, but their architecture does not compete with Intel's currently.

2) The i5-4460 is faster than the FX-8320. Clock speed is not the only stat to consider. Intels do more per clock than AMDs right now. Core count doesn't really help with gaming over 4 cores.Unless you're able to spend more money, that's the only upgrade to do.You could save a little on the RAM, the rest seems fine. For almost the same price you could get the next gen Intel CPUs though. I'd also get an aftermarket cooler if you're going to overclock. If you're not overclocking don't get the overclockable i5 and motherboard.

I assume you have a hard drive and SSD already?

Even if he has an adapter is it:
A) A USB-to-RS-232 adapter
B) An addon card that plugs into the motherboard's COM header, if it has one?On 1080p?An SSD is nice, something in the 240GB range from Samsung, Intel, or Crucial.I'm not responding to the person talking about a van, I'm not talking about overage throttling. I'm responding to you.

I imagine Ktown has hundreds of distribution boxes, so yes other people could be having problems while you're fine. Throttling also happens when the demand exceeds the available throughput, like when everyone gets home and turns on Netflix.

The problem could also be TWC needing to fix issues upstream. I'm IT-competent and use wired ethernet from an OpenWRT-configured router and still have to call them all the time to fix packet loss or reset something because I'm only getting 5 Mbps instead of 50 down. My upload is almost always fine though.Don't bother with expensive high-speed RAM, for gaming it doesn't really matter.I recently learned ASUS H97s allow OCing now. A few less knobs you can turn but you can do it.

http://www.techpowerup.com/202196/asus-enables-overclocking-on-h97-h87-b85-and-h81-series-motherboards.htmlDude your CPU and Motherboard are fine. The only thing I'd upgrade for gaming is your graphics card. What are you using for streaming? The Nvidia shadowplay stuff has pretty low overhead.

Maybe OC your CPU a little bit, while you're at it. Get an aftermarket cooler if you don't have one already.8 is all you need, 16 is nice if you have $$$ to spare. Either way DDR3-1600 (or even DDR3-1333) is fast enough. If you go with a Skylake/DDR4 build, DDR4-2133.We'd need to know which ATI HD69XX you have in order to make a good recommendation. I'm guessing not the dual-GPU 6990 because that would be dicey on a 500W PSU. Probably the 6950/6970.

You can reuse your RAM depending on which Intel you upgrade to.

I'd recommend an Intel i5 (180\u20ac), an B85/H97-chipset motherboard (50\u20ac+), and the best video card your remaining budget allows, maybe an AMD R9 380 (180\u20ac+).Only thing is that R9 380 is faster than your HD69XX, but may not be a huuuuge difference.No experience with those but seems like a good idea. I think they make USB adapters too. Might want to order one to test.Hey cool pokemon dude, HE ALREADY OWNS THE i5-4690K, why would he go through selling it and buying a slower one just so that it's not having any wasted potential?I can see that you are an internet expert and that everyone else is wrong and knows nothing about computers. I clearly can configure a router but can't tell the difference between Netflix being congested and my whole internet service being slow.I think the R9 380 should be a good upgrade, and you can't go much higher without buying a new power supply anyways.There is. Go to Asus's site and they have [BIOS files[(https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/H97PLUS/HelpDesk_Download/) and a [copy of the manual](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/H97PLUS/HelpDesk_Manual/) with instructions on how to upgrade your BIOS.I'm annoyed because a bunch of people are complaining about it and you are being very handwavey about it because it isn't being presented in the format that you would trust. The average Reddit user is not the average ISP user that just needs to reboot their modem/router. People aren't complaining on downdetector in peaks because the slow speeds are commonplace. Who's gonna complain on twitter every time their internet is slow? Many of the speed issues are such that average users might not even notice.The difference in games between the two is negligible. Upgrade the GPU and you're good for now.Did you plug your monitor into the GPU or the motherboard?With the amount you're spending 16GB of RAM wouldn't be a bad thing, but it's still not beneficial unless you game with many browser tabs and other programs open.

Try the single 980Ti for now and when it no longer meets your desired performance, upgrade to SLI or a new card.Performance varies depending on the game and the monitor resolution.Give us your full PC specs, including power supply model #The port on the mobo means you're using the integrated graphics on the CPU, not your GPU. You have to use its outputs to use it. If you weren't getting anything, I suggest unhooking and reseating your GPU in its slot, checking its power connectors from your PSU to make sure they're not loose. When you turn it on, do the fans on the GPU spin?You're the one asking us for advice. The reason is because if it's a crappy 430W I wouldn't recommend stressing it too much by putting in a high-amp video card, but if it's a nice 430W then you could go closer to its rated capacity. Also it may not have the correct PCIe connectors to support a faster GPU than the GTX 750Ti.

This is because A) Crappy ones use crappier parts thay may not hold up to being near capacity B) Crappier ones sometimes say they do a certain wattage, but then aren't capable of supplying most/all of that wattage on the 12V rail which is what powers your CPU/GPU, instead sort of cheating the spec by having a high amp rating on the 5v/3.3v rails, which power the motherboard/hard drive etc.

A 750Ti should be fine since it requires no extra PCIe connectors from your power supply, but the R7 260X is a better value right now and uses more power. The GTX 950 is also an option. You're probably fine whichever way, but without knowing your model I can't recommend further. What PCIe connectors does it have?Sorry wasn't able to answer faster. Seems like /u/zacnoo got you sorted.That's the unlocked version, your PCPartPicker list has the locked version.

Also protip: Switch to the Canadian version of PCPartPicker up in the top right.I don't think you need to know how to configure an iptable to tell whether it's your fault or your ISPs.Things to try:

Take out all of the RAM slots but the one in Slot #1, then if that doesn't work try another one in Slot #1 (consult your motherboard manual if you can't tell which one a solo stick should be installed on.)

Reseat your GPUCheap Intel Celeron G-series, cheap H81 motherboard, 4GB of RAM, cheap case, cheap PSU would probably be in the $150-200 range.Yep all you need is a GPU. Although, overclock the CPU if you haven't already, 4.0GHz can be had without upping the voltage at all. It's easy.

We need to know what power supply you have though, model number or name preferably. Otherwise we'd recommend something you might not be able to power. An R9 390 or GTX 970 is the best you can get for \u00a3250.I don't know what kind of selection is available in Greece, but I would try to find a better quality power supply than the Corsair VS series. 400W is enough, just recommending a better build quality.Yes, but not on max 1080p on Battlefront. Overwatch unknown.Damn papa goin' all out. I think the other commenters have covered any recommendations I'd make.Fallout 4 is just fancy skyrim engine, so if you can play skyrim ok, GPU is the best upgrade.No CX is the same OEM (Channel Well Technologies) that makes them for Corsair. Do you have a Greek store you're looking at? Something like:

http://www.e-shop.gr/psu-seasonic-ss-400et-400w-p-PER.640385

http://www.e-shop.gr/psu-xfx-ts-series-450w-p-PER.811434Ok, so not the best power supply for overclocking but at least you have wattage to spare. Either of those GPUs I mentioned should work.Yeah I think I found the store you were looking at while I was searching, all they had was cheap Corsairs and some mystery brand that I didn't trust.I've found Asus proper to be hit-and-miss, but ASRock, their baby brother, has been great for me. Also had good luck with MSI and Gigabyte. Even have an old cheapo Biostar that still works.

I think motherboards vary model to model more than any other components though. The best thing to do is to not buy too new, and wait for reviews to come out. 4 stars and up on Newegg only.Why not the cheapest i5 + compatible motherboard?Yes, but I've had better luck with them in my experience.It's out today. Extrapolating from [this benchmark](http://www.gamersnexus.net/game-bench/2177-fallout-4-pc-video-card-fps-benchmark-all-resolutions), I'm guessing 30-50 average fps on low-medium 1080p. Playable. There's Russian videos on youtube of people playing it on 560 Tis.Have you tried Fallout 4 on your current system? Seems like it'd be able to handle it at 1080p high/ultra.PC will be more than fine. You could probably ultra 1440p at close to 60fps.

Remember the PS4 runs at 1080p med-high equivalent at 30fps.low-medium I think you'll be close. Hard to say, especially since the rest of your PC is unknown.Ok the rest is fine then.I think if anything your CPU will hold you back more than your GPU, but you'll be ok, especially if you don't need to run at absolute max.Is it open wifi? At my CSU they had Cisco software you had to log in to with your student ID.Oh nice. It's been a few years, maybe they've loosened it up at my campus (the other CP)...checking...nope they still make guests fill out paperwork to get on, and make students use their student logins.It'll play with more than 30fps at medium 900p, how close to 60 I can't tell you because there are no benchmarks of that card yet.We need to know your power supply model/wattage to make sure these will work.

with regard to the R9 380, I'm seeing cheaper models: http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r93802gd5toc $240 after rebate.

Either that or spend $290 to get a 4GB version, which should hold up better in the coming years:
http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/club-3d-video-card-cgaxr93858

I'd say keep the i5, keep the motherboard, use your existing 8GB of DDR3 RAM, get the SSD, get a R9 380 instead of R9 390, keep the power supply.Maybe slightly, maybe not at all.This is the condescending stuff I'm talking about. You might say I've run a tracert before.Are you going to OC or not? If yes, get it. If not, don't waste your money. To be honest, why are you even upgrading? You have an i7-3770! The difference for gaming will be like 1 fps. Just get a new case.

http://www.techspot.com/review/1041-intel-core-i7-6700k-skylake/page10.htmlBuy a used one off /r/hardwareswap for cheap!Why can you only use 7 gigs? Are you currently using integrated graphics that are "borrowing" a gig? If that's the case, when you use it in your new machine it'll be able to use all 8.

Also minimum specs are just guidelines, 8 will probably perform just the same as 7.Ok, that should be able to handle either the R9 380 or R7 370. I'd consider upgrading your PSU down the line, as that model is not really meant for high loads. (Extreme Power Plus is great marketing though!)What are you upgrading for? Games? You don't need more for games, especially in a midrange system.Ok, it will help with the editing, but in BO3 it's because it's got a memory leak that hopefully they'll patch soon. I think it's using whatever you've got. People with 12GB-16GB of RAM are complaining.

But ok, let's upgrade for the editing. I'm going to assume this will be the last time you want to upgrade the RAM in this PC, because you'll have bigger problems (CPU) and by then you'll be upgrading to a DDR4 platform. Get whichever is the cheapest way to add 8GB, but if it's about the same price get 2 more sticks to keep it running in dual channel. This will provide up to a 5% speed improvement in video editing apps.Please provide the rest of your build so far.You don't need both an APU and a dedicated GPU. An APU is a CPU with a low-midrange GPU built in. For gaming you really want just a fast regular CPU and the fastest dedicated GPU you can buy.Good midrange penny-pincher build. Do it.Next time read the FAQ and do this yourself, please. Seems legit, and that they have knocked a few $$ off the new price, but who's to say?

 Exercise the usual precautions for Craigslist if you go though with it. Pay in-person via paypal (as a transaction, not as a gift) if possible, instead of cash. Making restrictions like that might help weed out scammers before you even go through with it, as they'll move on to easier prey.

Which you're not doing, you're dual channeling the old set together and the new set together. But yes, same voltage and speed, they all run at the same speed as the slowest ones.You should be able to use either, but the Corsair set is safer as it defaults to the same timings already.That's an overclocked model which is why it wants MOAR power from the 8pins rather than the 6pins. 

It being ok depends on what your power supply is. So what is it?Just because you can hook adapters up to it doesn't mean there aren't reasons it doesn't have those plugs in the first place: it can't really output that much. It's a cheap 300W PSU in 550W clothing. It only has a single 12V rail with a max of 25A. A basic Seasonic (good brand) 400W has two 12V rails 17A apiece, for 34A total. You don't have the amps to run an R9 280. The 12V rail is shared between your CPU and GPU mostly. Since you have 25A to share you can support 12v * 25A = 300W on that rail. Your GPU alone needs 250W at peak, your CPU needs 95W at peak. Too much. You need to replace it ASAP before you burn up your whole PC.It is in theory, on a beefy PSU. But it also allows people with crap PSUs to hook up things that require more power than they can put out.Depends on the model of GTX 970. Some factory overclocked models have higher power requirements.~~I think /u/ retrocomputix is right. The model OP linked only has 2x 6-pins.~~

~~I think OP has one of these two, they're the only 2 Zotacs with 2x8-pins:~~

~~https://www.zotac.com/product/graphics_card/gtx-980-ti-amp-extreme#spec~~

~~https://www.zotac.com/product/graphics_card/gtx-980-ti-amp-omega#spec~~

~~They have a TDP of 258W, which could be reduced to OP's hardware limit of 225W by downclocking/undervolting.~~

**EDIT**: There's a no-longer-sold variant of the Zotac GTX 970 Extreme Edition (model #: ZT-90103-10P vs ZT-90107-10P) that uses 2x 8-pins.Check out my other post below:
https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3s8kew/build_help_question_about_gtx_970_and_its_pins/cwv2dm3Until cheap PSUs go away (never), we'll keep seeing people burn up their computers because they had a convenient adapter instead of being forced to buy a new power supply like they should have. The adapters are poor practice.Sorry yeah just updated my post. I found a review of your model, which has since been replaced with a 2x 6-pin version (the one you linked)http://www.userbenchmark.comGet #2 then underclock it a little so it's not as hot and loud, it'll still beat #1Naturally they come with them. They want people to buy the card regardless of whether it's a good idea or not.FO4 medium is iffy, the other two are fine. Consider getting off Vista, that should improve performance and general happiness. You can always bring your new OS with you when you upgrade.Wattage is fine, GTX 960 wants a 400W+I'd suggest an 850W PSU if you plan to overclock and SLI later.I'd guess that's mixed low-med.Put together a PCPartPicker list with everything I mentioned and paste the reddit code here.Keep in mind that PCPartPicker only has the stock model power draw (165W) listed, not the higher power draw of an overclocked model. On EVGA's site they list 180W for this model, with some models going up to 300W.

You're probably right for this model though. Forgot the stock wattage for the 980 wasn't nearly as high as the 980Ti.That's certainly one way of looking at it. After all, a domesticated cold-weather breed has great long-term odds of survival in a concrete desert.It's impossible to tell who's joking on here any more. Was I? Who knows?Your RAM is a bit expensive for 8GB of DDR3, especially DDR3-1600 with CAS 11. Prices fluctuate so get whatever DDR3 is cheapest when you go to buy. This one's good, cheaper, and fits your color scheme:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-memory-blt2kit4g3d1608dt2txob

Curious about all the fans, your case already comes with 2x 120mm fans, with room for 3 more. Replacing them with better ones/trying to create a specific case pressure?

CPU cooler definitely optional.Yeah, although as I said, the R9 390 is overkill for 768p gaming and the R9 380 would be fine.Either of them is sufficient for your resolution/settings needs. What RAM do you have currently? Faster DDR3 really isn't worth it, so unless you're running out of RAM don't bother.That's not really going to help. BO3 has memory leaks bugs that need to be patched and even people with 12GB-16GB are having issues.Silverstone RVZ01/RVZ02/RVX01, some slightly bigger ones might work too.Well, it will definitely hold up a bit longer, it's about 50% more powerful with double the VRAM. But also it's 50% more expensive. Ultimately you might get another year of good use out of it, or you could get the cheaper one, save your money and upgrade sooner.Cheaper doesn't necessarily mean bad quality, it's just pricing and marketing. Crucial is a US-based subsidiary of Micron (who makes the actual memory chips) and a very trusted brand. Team Elite (Teamgroup) is a Taiwanese company that's fine too. The kit I linked is actually a higher-binned part, it runs at the same speed but with lower CAS latency. Won't make any huge gaming fps difference (1% maybe) but cheaper too.
Australia, huh?

You don't need a Z97 motherboard since you're getting a non-overclocking CPU.

Cheaper motherboard, $1 more hard drive but more reliable, cheaper video card, cheaper case, better/cheaper power supply:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-110b20750vr

If no, you can save money by going with a Xeon E3 1231v3 CPU instead, it's an i7 without overclocking and without the built in GPU for about $240. Also an H97 or B85 motherboard instead.
Double your RAM for video editing, better video card for better performance while streaming. (depending on the games you play).

I think your power supply is ok for a non-overclocking build, unless you put a monster GPU in there.For clarity, your planned upgrades:

Just to be clear, you are planning on overclocking? Some people put together OC builds without realizing, but it looks like you know what you're doing

Yeah dude this should be fine. GPU will probably be your next upgrade in a few years, just cause the tech changes faster.That's correct, you'd lose the ability to tag team multiple GPUs together, but I've always found it better to just sell your old card and buy the new goods when it's time to upgrade.

This power supply isn't quite as fancy but it's a great deal right now still more than sufficient for your build.I think with the promo code it actually works out to be a dollar or two less (not counting tax). Case aesthetics are such a personal preference thing but that's functionally a great case. Keep in mind it's a bit bigger that the N200 as it can fit full-size ATX motherboards too, that may be a positive or a negative for you, depending.It means you're overpaying for parts that are for overclocking, since you won't be using it. The CPU itself is a decent price even though it's an overclocking one, since it's clocked higher without overclocking.

But you could do away with the CPU cooler (it comes with a basic one), and you could go cheaper on the motherboard by getting an H97 motherboard instead. Or just a cheaper Z97, that way you can overclock later if you change your mind.

Motherboard-wise, I guess you could hang on to that one should you choose to OC later, but there are cheaper options even buying the RAM separately if you're not planning on SLI/Crossfire (and at that resolution, there's no need to...also rocking the 1680x1050 here).

Still, go with the power supply I recommended.It appears there's a new version of the HAF 912 that has 1x 3.0 and 1x 2.0 instead. No matter if you receive the new version or the old version, the wires come from the case not the motherboard, so you won't have any spare wires, just spare ports, which is fine. (Spare wires are ok too, though I recommend zip tying them out of the way)Cheaper but equivalent RAM, nicer/cheaper power supply, 240GB newer/faster/cheaper SSD:

MSI and ASRock are also good motherboard brands

Memory: You won't see much difference in DDR4 vs DDR3, but you might be able to reuse DDR4 when you upgrade next time, whereas DDR3 you won't. 16GB might be nice for SolidWorks and if you like to multitask, but not necessary. I recommend buying fewer larger sticks so you can upgrade in the future.

Video card: R9 380 is more than enough for LoL and SolidWorks, but for more demanding games the 390 could be nice.

Power supply: That one is ok but I think I can do better. Most highly rated models are quiet. Better deals if you're fine with rebates though.

That SSD is no good, there are better for cheaper.

Amazon and Newegg are probably the two best. Superbiiz is cheap and has funky shipping, never used them but they're probably fine.

I'd still suggest the power supply and RAM from my list.Yes, I think you'll get what you want out of this build, and will probably want to upgrade the GPU first in a few years. Only thing I'd recommend is getting an SSD in the build, like a 250GB Samsung 850 EVO for $80.Yes. You can put smaller motherboards in bigger cases but not bigger motherboards in smaller cases.

Common sizes from smallest to largest:

MiniITX, MicroATX, ATX, E-ATXCool! Some of them are on a membership basis and some are super laid back and informal, but I'm sure if you let them know what you want to do you could do it for either a daily/weekly membership price or free.You know there are DDR3 (L) 1151 motherboards, right?Full modular vs semi isn't a big deal. Quality of the unit is more important. Usually the ones that aren't modular are the ones every system needs.

Aftermarket CPU coolers are totally optional for a non-overclocking build, but a $15-30 dollar one can be quieter and more effective than the cooler that comes with the CPU.Yeah I remember those had problems. I think I may have profited from it because the next gen Crucial SSDs were cheaper from people being sketched out, but it's been problem free.Not really. It just feels more spacious.

Do you have a lot of programs running on boot? Done a virus scan?

With everything else closed, try running [UserBenchmark](http://www.userbenchmark.com/), it might pinpoint if anything is acting funky.Please provide your full system spec, including power supply model.You can't upgrade the motherboard without upgrading the CPU, as this is a socket 1151 motherboard and your CPU is socket 1150. 

Why are you upgrading the motherboard anyways? Or the power supply? None of these upgrades will improve your performance. Well, 16GB of RAM will help with video editing but that's about it.This is already a very high end rig, what are you trying to upgrade it for? Specific games? Do you do non-gaming intensive things on this PC? DDR3 is cheap right now, you could double it easily for about $30, or buy a whole new 16GB kit of faster DDR3 for under $80.

A faster SSD will be not noticeable for most things. More RAM will only be noticeable for video editing or heavy multitasking. If you're doing 144Hz 1440p/4k gaming the best upgrade is to SLI the GPU.

What's your power supply?If you have another power supply, give it a try.

Else it's probably your motherboard is fried or something to do with your CPU cooling. You could try reseating the cooler.I'd suggest reinstalling the drivers, but this is a little weird. What power supply model do you have?I think there are better power supply options for the price these days than Corsair. Look at XFX, Seasonic, EVGA, Super Flower, Silverstone (except for "Essential")

Case-wise what kind of look do you like? Black and restrained or all gamered out with a window and aggressive shapes? Do you want small (microATX) or more flexible for future motherboard upgrades (ATX), or don't care?

Here are the most recent Catalyst Beta and Full release:

http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/latest-catalyst-windows-beta.aspx

http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMDCatalyst15-7-1WINReleaseNotes.aspxSo uh, why do you feel as though an upgrade is needed?First, try the rear mic port and see if the issue is the same. Then try reinstalling your sound card driver, and verify that the front audio wiring inside your case isn't sitting on top of major power supply lines or right next to your GPU.CA Penal code says that it's lawful to display replica firearms during the course of a film or stage production, but they might nail them for causing a False emergency and filming without permit.I forgot about the PCIe lane difference between the 5820k and 5930k, good catch. Should it matter? You don't really need Tri/Quad SLI, but still relevant info.The difference between x8 PCIe 3.0 and x16 PCIe 3.0 is negligible, even x8 PCIe 2.0 (1/4 of the bandwidth of x16 PCIe 3.0) is very close. We're not even close to saturating the bus, nor will we be. A single 980Ti will use about 4% of a PCIe 3.0 x16 bus.

It still has 28 lanes, meaning you can do a x16, x8, and x4, or three x8 lanes for triple SLI and one x4 NVMe, or two x8 for regular SLI and three x4 NVMe.Only time will tell.I'd go ahead and clean up any residue left behind when you remove the stock cooler, there usually is some. Just use a q-tip and a small amount of rubbing alcohol, and of course make sure your computer has been off and unplugged for a little while.What loud grinding fan noise? That's not a good thing. What fan is it coming from?Depends on the parts. If you're planning on overclocking your CPU, add another 50-100W.

PCPartPicker often doesn't take into account the added wattage of factory-overclocked graphics cards, add on some more depending on if your model is OC'd. Another 50-100W maybe. (You can sanity check this by how many PCIe connectors your graphics card has. PCIe slot alone gives up to 75W, 8-pin PCIe connector gives up to 125W, 6-pin up to 75W) 

You want a little bit extra for aging of capacitors in your power supply, say +10-15%

Also think about future upgrades? Is your current graphics card midrange but you'd like to be able to put in a nicer one later? Leave a little extra wattage in there.Is this for gaming? That's a really high-end CPU/motherboard setup with a lower-midrange graphics card.

As it is I'd say a nice 450W-500W would be plenty, that graphics card doesn't need much.

Here's Your build with an inexpensive good power supply. Swapped the RAM for slightly faster/slightly cheaper stuff.

Also note that the Western Digital Blue in your build is one of the Greens rebranded now that Western Digital has combined their product lines. They run at a slower RPM and are great for storing media and such but I might not recommend if you're going to have a lot of games installed there.

To be honest I don't think your CPU is your bottleneck, especially at 1440p. An i7-920 @ 3.8 performs only a little slower than an i5-4430, which is not a real bottleneck for games even though it runs a little slower than a new i7. It can definitely wait a few months, maybe for the Skylake motherboard/RAM prices to drop a little more.

I think a GTX 680 SC is probably still your bottleneck at 1440p. A GTX 680 is close to a GTX 960 in performance, which does medium/high well at 1080p but less so at 1440p, especially a 2GB version. I also find that older Nvidia cards are not as well optimized for newer games (this may be a driver issue, not a hardware issue)

I'd suggest looking at a GTX 970/R9 390/R9 390x/GTX 980.It's an old design but it's hard to argue with the results. (actually, are the newer ones still the same design? They combined the 12V rails a while back and it isn't clear because the model # is the same.)

The XFX Proseries P1-550S-XXB9 is a great option too though!Whoops, posted my comment too soon. 

In what games are you finding your performance to lag behind? In really CPU-heavy stuff you might see some improvement from a CPU upgrade, but otherwise I think graphics will have a greater impact.

It's fine, but doesn't hurt.What are the fans plugged into? Your motherboard? A fan controller? Fan power ports on your power supply?/r/buildapcforme, or at least give us some more information. They'll need it over there too.Jesus Christ, you talked her into it alright? $3k?What kind of work does she do? Writing and photo editing or more hardware-intensive stuff like computation/simulation/CAD/video editing?No, turbo mode is what 1-2 of the cores ramp up to when it's being used. Normally it should be 3.3GHz. When it's not being used it should speedstep down to an even lower frequency.

You could save some money by getting the similarly OC'd Zotac AMP! OMEGA or Gigabyte G1 version of the 980Ti instead.What's your motherboard and how many RAM sticks do you have already in there?So you're just upgrading CPU, cooler, and case?

I'd recommend a better power supply for an overclocking setup, look into an EVGA/Seasonic/XFX. Two things: Based on the mount plate of that card it looks like one of the DVI ports and the bottom-most DP port might share circuitry, you may not be able to use both at the same time. I assume you tried another DP port?

The description for that adapter doesn't say it's active. Are you sure it is?The only ones you won't use are the 3 right-most ones, but those still shouldn't interfere with you getting it in the case.

YOU DON'T PUT THE STANDOFFS THROUGH YOUR MOTHERBOARD HOLES, YOU REST THE MOTHERBOARD ON TOP OF THEM AND SCREW INTO THEM FROM ABOVE WITH SEPARATE SCREWS THAT CAME WITH THE CASE.Well, make sure there's nothing obstructing any of the pins on either the receptacle or the cable side.

And if that's fine, you just need to push harder. Support the motherboard with your finger from behind if it's bending.GTX 970 owner here. It renders at 4k and downsamples to 1080p, giving you smoother lines and an overall softer "cinematic" look to the image. 4k to 1080p is "4x" DSR because it's 4x the pixels. You can also do 2x, 1.5x, 1.25x, etc. resolutions that are smaller than 4k for higher performance but slightly less effective.

It's basically True full-screen anti-aliasing, as well as higher texture sampling. You can turn off AA entirely if you use it, or use lower AA settings for even more anti-jaggies.

The major downside is it shrinks the HUD in many games, and does some funky things if you have multiple monitors (moreso on Windows 7 than Windows 10). I use DSR 2x + maxed settings and FXAA in Elite: Dangerous and Dirt:Rally just fine at 60fps.It's all good. Make sure you're following a good PC building guide online and reading the motherboard manual. Best of luck!980 is safer but you could run brand new games at 1440p on a 970 with slightly reduced (high probably) settings. For 1440p maybe consider the R9 390/390X though.Yeah, it's fine. If you're not shooting 4k+ video I wouldn't sweat it.[PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/2VfZNG) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/2VfZNG/by_merchant/)

It is in no way necessary to buy a $650 graphics card to play 1440p.In Fallout 4 you can probably get by with 1080 high/ultra with god rays turned down. Planetside I hear there are some tweaks you can do.If you've never had an SSD before, a budget SSD will still be a huge change of pace. Nice SSDs like the 950 Pro or Intel PCIe ones is like not being satisfied with a 1992 Geo Metro and so you go out and buy a McLaren P1, when you would have just been fine with a BMW M3 or Acura TL, or even a Honda Accord.

For just loading games and booting, a basic SSD is fine.Silverstone RVX/RVZ cases. You can even use larger GPUs and regular SSDs.

http://www.silverstonetek.com/raven/products/index.php?model=RVZ01Stock is fine. It may be a little louder than an aftermarket one would be, depending on your case temps.That video card isn't a very good deal anymore, the R9 380, its replacement, is out now. But for a little more than that you can get the R9 390, which is feasible to do 1440p gaming on, or get high frame rates at 1080p/reduced settings 1440p.

Swapped your power supply with a fully-modular one of similar performance and cheaper price, but your existing one is really nice too (The 650W version of your pick is $80/$70 after rebate if that is preferable)

Even with a small GPU and M.2 you still need to fit at least an SFX power supply in a custom build, plus a regular ITX motherboard and CPU cooler. The Alienware Alpha uses laptop parts, which is how it gets so small.

They do make a few smaller power supply/motherboard designs for custom builds, but selection is limited.What is your budget? I'd say upgrade GPU first but Fallout 4 is very CPU-dependent too.Yes, you were the one that posted a white case so I assume that's what you wanted. You thinking more of a plain black, no-window-or-gamery-shit deal? (That's more my style too)

Here's a few options. Some are ATX, which leave you options should you upgrade to a full-size motherboard in the future, and are roomier but bigger. Others are microATX so smaller, only fit microATX or smaller motherboards, somewhat less roomy. All of them are good cases.

microATX:

ATX:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-case-200r

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/thermaltake-case-ca1c100m1nn00I'd also consider using a single 8GB RAM stick instead, which will let you upgrade later:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/a-data-memory-ax3u1600w8g9rbTo paraphrase what /u/KING_of_Trainers69 is saying, GHz is only really useful to compare processors of the same product line. The best thing to do is to look at benchmarks, or the handy Gaming CPU tier list over at Tom's Hardware: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312.htmlI'd say you've got two choices then:

1 . Overclock your CPU a little more (get an aftermarket cooler if you don't already have one, like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo for $20-30) and buy a new GPU like the GTX 960 or R9 380 for around $160-180.

An i5 has twice as many cores as an i3. The graphics card is much better. It has a cheaper motherboard.It's a quad core with hyperthreading, which means it can split into 8 threads. Perfectly sufficient for streaming and gaming. That motherboard is not compatible with your chosen processor, different socket.I'd avoid RAM if it had shitty reviews as cheapo bad manufacturers exist, but most RAM is fine and just works. There are different speeds (higher slightly better in games, if your motherboard supports it), voltages (just needs to be low enough), and CAS latency (lower is marginally better), but yeah it's all RAM.

For the price check out these more colorful ones instead:

You could buy a used i7-2xxx/3xxx or i5-2xxx/3xxx off of /r/hardwareswap for under $150, keep your existing RAM, and just get away with a GPU upgrade to something like an R9 380 ($160-180)/R9 380X ($220)/GTX 970 ($250-320)/R9 390 ($260-320). Maybe throw a cheap SSD ($40-80) in there too.Knocked your price down a bit while sacrificing nothing in the way of performance but you'll need to go further to also fit in a 1440p 144Hz monitor, because they cost $450 unless you go with a QNIX and then you have a high chance of dead pixels.

XTREME has slightly higher core and memory clocks from the factory.

See the Tech PowerUp GPU DB entries for them and compare:

http://www.techpowerup.com/gpudb/b3518/gigabyte-gtx-970-xtreme.html

http://www.techpowerup.com/gpudb/b3050/gigabyte-gtx-970-g1-gaming.html

Not to say it's worth the extra money, but it's out there for those who want it. No trustworthy reviews to be found on the XTREME version though.Depends on the game, but it should lead to an overall improvement, and will definitely help with things like Fallout 4, GTA V, etc, anything recent really.

It's ~50% faster at single-core tasks and over 100% faster at quad-core tasks.It's just a dumb website typo or something, it'll work.Anyone who sees this, don't get that SSD, not when a Samsung 850 EVO is $4 more.It says you have 8GB of RAM, but your system needs to use some of it to run. See up top where it says 8GB?

As for the speed, yes you'll need to go into the BIOS. Read a guide, or just look around the BIOS until you find memory settings and the ones you need.I updated my msg regarding the speeds. You'll need to go into the BIOS. Read your motherboard manual or just poke around until you find memory settings.Yeah happens all the time.Please provide the rest of your system specs.Bump up GPU to R9 390 if you can afford it.

http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/motherboard/#xcx=0&amp;c=99&amp;sort=a8&amp;page=1The IPS drawbacks for gaming are minimal unless you're an uber-pro FPS gamer. IPS response times are much lower than they used to be (&lt;1 frame @ 60Hz). 

However, I wouldn't recommend a 27" 1080p monitor if you intend on being very close to the screen, as you will be above the DPI point where you can see the pixels.

I hear 1440p on medium can look better than 1080p on high, I'd consider that.You could try a fresh Windows install, if you haven't done that.

I agree with /u/jdorje to try a new power supply. At the very least since it's 6 years old you'd probably want to grab a new one no matter what.

Try running SMART tools on the hard drive and see if something is failing there.Look at the used market if you want to save money. Check out a 660Ti (outperforms a 750Ti), cheap.Read the rules -----&gt;

http://www.logicalincrements.com/ (take it with a grain of salt)Probably, but since you didn't tell us what motherboard, we can only guess.Build looks good for horrendous AUS prices (sorry bud). It's a solid PC that should do what you want. They put together a nice budget build.Wide graphics cards are pretty common. 2" thick means it uses 3 case expansion slots and then a little bit more, they're each ~0.6". This does mean you won't be able to use any other PCIe slots on that motherboard. This one is more but only takes 2 slots:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-video-card-strixr9380dc2oc4g

Or you could switch to an ATX motherboard.

If you click on the case and scroll down it says:

&gt;MAXIMUM VIDEO CARD LENGTH

&gt;11.81" (300mm) With Drive Cages

&gt;16.93" (430mm) Without Drive CagesYeah, just the iGPU RAM use if you've got it turned on.It will probably be more than enough for modded Morrowind/New Vegas. This system could run modded Skyrim/regular Fallout 4. For Civ 5 an i5 is pretty good. 

You could go cheaper on the GPU, but that's the only part I'd drop down. If you do want to save some money there l'd recommend  one of these:

They're roughly the same value for the price they're at. A bit slower than the R9 380 but still will do well in the games you named. (XCOM 2 is a guess but based off the specs of the first one, should be ok).

http://au.pcpartpicker.com/part/sapphire-video-card-112320020g

http://au.pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-video-card-gvr927oc2gdThat's just the RAM the integrated GPU uses if you're not using your separate nice GPU. If you are using your regular GPU, it will not use it.Would he do the black or red NZXT Phantom 410 Case instead? A bit cheaper, very similar styling.

Everything else looks fine.It's not terrible, but it comes with a crappy power supply. Here is an equivalent homebuild with all the same parts except for with a much better power supply:

http://www.logicalincrements.com/ (take it with a grain of salt)The only way to add an extra GPU to your laptop is to use an eGPU interface, which is basically connecting to a desktop graphics card through your laptop's ExpressCard or mini-PCIe interface. It's not cheap though. You have to buy the interface ($50+), a desktop power supply ($20+), and a desktop graphics card ($50 used to about $80-100 new for the cheapest I'd recommend.)

It won't be portable and you also have to use an external monitor, you can't use your laptop's screen.

What laptop do you have? You may or may not even be able to support it.Yeah. I think you can in a few games that are designed for it (Supreme Commander 2, I think?, and World in Conflict I guess I actually used it), but it can't be added via the drivers and pretend to be one big one unless you have 3. There's probably ways to fake the third if you needed to.

I can't think of too many games I'd want on two monitors. Shooters, racing, flying, etc all are a better experience on three. Not a big strategy game guy though.It's not the drivers, it's the utility. If you just use the drivers it's fine I hear.&gt; HP Envy m4

Which model m4? m4 is like saying "Honda Accord" but there's like 80 different years and models of Honda Accords.

That model doesn't have Expresscard so I'm pretty sure you'd have to remove the Wifi card to put the mini-PCIe interface in. You may also have to install some software to fool the computer into thinking that's ok. 

Basically sounds like it'll be a lot of work, so if you're not super computer-savvy idk if it's a good idea.It's easy to try. Could be the boot record, you could try rebuilding.The differences are so small none of it really matters.LOL buying top of the line parts and asking if you should get better parts.RAM uses very little power and thus very little heat compared to the rest of your system. RAM doesn't even need the heat spreaders that gamer RAM comes with, it's just there to look cool.Good build, Wouldn't recommend changing a thing.An 8GB 390 does about the same in Fallout 4 as the GTX 970, the VRAM isn't the issue.

They'll both do about 55fps avg with dips a little lower at 1440p ultra. Lower god rays and maybe another thing or two and you're set.

Let's keep the fanboying out of this.Well, you didn't tell us what is was for, so "better" is kind of a moving target.There is a catch on the end of your motherboard's PCIe slot that you need to push down or to the side to release that little tab. See the photo here:

https://s3.graphiq.com/sites/default/files/5030/media/images/Asrock_H97M_Anniversary_6526278.jpgWhat's your GPU? That's a far more limiting factor in The Witcher 3.

You could bump up to an FX-8350 ($150, ~30% faster) or FX-4350 ($90. ~20% faster), but you'd get similar results to those at stock speeds from overclocking your existing CPU (just with less cores than the FX-8350, obviously, but for most games 4 is enough).

There are also the FX-9590 ($200 with no cooler, ~40% faster), but your motherboard may not support it, and at that price you could do an i5 + cheap motherboard anyways, which will beat that no problem.Can you not see it in the photo I posted? It needs to be pushed towards the RAM from the looks of it. At the same time, pull the card out.

Your CPU can pump up to 70fps @ medium, that GPU only about 50fps medium, 40fps high.Try coming at it from the side where the little blue heatsink is, bending your finger so it slips underneath the gpu to push the tab towards the RAM.It's a decent build although the RAM is slower than it needs to be and the power supply is probably not great (hard to tell which Thermaltake 650W model it is but I'd guess the cheapo SMART, which isn't very good). You can build it yourself for about $630 with a better power supply so you're paying like $180 for support.

If you built it yourself with that extra $180 you could get a much better video card and upgrade the CPU to an i5.http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/cpu-cooler/#h=14,150&amp;sort=d4&amp;page=1&amp;X=0,4042That issue with the FX 8350 is weird, like it makes no sense.

I'd recommend an i5-4460/Xeon e3-1231v3 + socket 1150 motherboard and a GTX 960/970 or R9 390 GPU, plus a 550W power supply.Idk what their support includes, might be useful to clarify.No worries dude, glad I could help.I just said it makes no sense, as in no I have no idea what's going on there. That is a weird issue. Was it repeatable?

Yes those upgrades should be sufficient.No longer maxing FO4 @ 60fps, but you prob can turn down god rays and only slightly reduce other stuff and be fine, it'll look basically the same. Similar with Shadow of Mordor, almost Ultra 1080p 60fps. LoL doesn't need much.

The 390 is about 40% faster in raw power, which translates to 10-35% faster depending on resolution and game.Ok so basically they'll help set it up and keep your software good, and on the hardware side they'll manage the warranty stuff already offered by the manufacturer for you, but do not extend the warranty.An SSD is a flash memory-based storage device which is able to write and read its data more quickly than a hard drive (which has a spinning disk with a bunch of magnetic zeros and ones on it), and never needs to be defragged.

They let your OS start quickly and games load faster. They make programs start very quickly after launching them. You feel like you're waiting for your computer a lot less.

If you have one SSD and one hard drive, you should put your OS install on the SSD, as well as whatever games you can fit that you want to load fast, and other programs. Put the rest of your games on the other hard drive along with your media files. Steam lets you install games to more than one location now.Well, it's not that they give you a warranty. If you bought those parts yourself, they would still have a warranty. So it's not so much protecting you from a lemon as letting someone take care of the hassle of returning parts if you do get some. If you need some recommendations on parts for a given budget and use case, hit us up.I changed the parts because I could pick better or equivalent stuff for less money.  EVGA is a very popular brand and has been around for years, maybe they just spend less on advertising? I bought an EVGA Nvidia GPU in like 2007? Dunno how you haven't heard of them.

But as /u/jdorje says, most companies like Corsair and EVGA don't even make their power supplies, OEMs like Seasonic, Channel Well, HEC, FSP, and Super Flower do. Corsair lately has coasted on their brand name and overcharged for what their power supplies provide.

The GPU is much cheaper than the Asus and has good reviews. Not everything Powercolor makes is great but the consensus on this model is good.

The case has 1 140mm fan included vs 2 120mm on your pick, and is $20 cheaper, so feel free to spend some of that on another 120mm or 140mm fan. I think it fits more fans than the 350D, actually. All reviews say that it has great cooling.An i5-4460 and an inexpensive B85/H87 chipset motherboard would round it out nicely ($210-230), or if you're down to overclock an i5-4690k and Z87 motherboard ($290-310).For the GTX 960? (The GTX 970 only comes in 4GB (3.5+0.5), and the R9 390 only comes with 8GB)

The 4GB GTX 960 is a little better, but if it's way more money it's not worth it.

If you're looking for a consistent 60fps on maxed Fallout 4 one of the other 2 cards would be better though.For sure. The GTX 960 will be close and with slightly reduced settings in Fallout 4 can do it.MicroATX motherboards are fine in ATX cases. You may need to move standoffs or add additional standoffs that should have come with the case. (Standoffs are the little silver or golden hexagon things that you're going to align with your motherboard holes)

Are you certain you've got it in the correct orientation/position? Try taking a photo of what you're doing and posting it here.This is probably the most annoying part of building a PC, all good.

Those ports should be labeled on your motherboard, or if you look in the motherboard manual, it has pinouts saying where everything is on your board.

Most are in the bottom right corner near the SATA/M.2 ports in a big block of pins, the audio one is labeled AAFP and is further towards the back of the case.You didn't take pictures of the hard drive or video card from very helpful angles. The CPU is covered by its cooler so it could be any socket 1155 Intel CPU. Pretty sure this is what you have so far, GPU could be 2GB version, can't tell without model #:

An ssd is really nice, especially on a laptop. What model is it? There may be other ways to add a hard drive, or in some cases there's no room for a proper hard drive, only SSDs.Burning it to a disc is easier. Windows can use basic graphics drivers until you can download them from the internet on the pc itselfI agree with /u/zyck_titan, an external USB 3.0 should be fine for games. Just install your programs and the games you want to load fast on the SSD, and your other games/media/documents on the external.Motherboard BIOS updates are usually only recommended to fix issues.

Motherboard drivers, on the other hand, yes. Windows might install some but you may want to install newer ones from Intel/AMD/Your motherboard manufacturer.

If you still have your older hard drive working you also could just clone the drive to your new one.What is the rest of your build?You don't need thermal paste, especially for 10 EUR

1. Motherboard looks ok. Maybe could find one a little cheaper but the H97s have good features. Check out the one I picked though.

2. Picked a cheaper/smaller case out. It has 2 fans already, should be enough.

3. No non-stock coolers needed for a non-CPU-OC build. If you find the stock CPU cooler is loud under load, look into a cheap aftermarket one.

4. Nope

5. This monitor would be a good one with built-in pivot function, but couldn't find it in Italy:
http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00EQAG31A/  Or you can get a VESA-compatible monitor and buy a separate mount.

6. Buy a powered USB 2.0 extender set. Cables don't get longer than 15 ft. **Or** buy a wireless kb/mouse set.

Made a number of changes to the build: Cheaper CPU that's only 6% slower but 12% cheaper. Cheaper RAM in a single stick (no real difference in gaming). MX200 SSD instead of MX100, faster+cheaper. Better brand of graphics card that will run cooler/quieter, plus is a little faster (factory overclock). Cheaper case.

Also I'd suggest checking your BIOS settings to see if there is anything there. Your motherboard manual suggest hooking up the monitor(s) to the GPU closer to the CPU.
No, you'll have to use an HDMI or DVI DA or manually switch the ports.Wipe the old drivers, then install the new drivers.Is it an imagination computer?Use the resources on the sidebar-----&gt;

The GTX 750Ti, GTX 950, and GTX 960 are all good, cool-running options. Even the 750Ti will be a decent upgrade, it's almost twice as powerful as your 5770.

However, a better value for the price than the 750Ti at $220 is the R7 370, which is a refresh of the HD 7850/R7 265/R7 270. It's about 40% more powerful than the 750Ti and uses a single PCIe 6-pin. In the US it's meant to compete with the GTX 950.

Oh, and don't do anything too crazy with that power supply. The ones that come with cases are notoriously mediocre at best.

No, the motherboard cannot output the graphics from the GPU.I'm pretty sure it wouldn't like it. It might show a greyed/blacked out window, it might crash the game/gpu driver, never tried it myself.

On a lot of systems you can't even use both motherboard gpu and discrete gpu at the same time.https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV_PC/comments/32sn2d/driver_uninstaller_ddu_cleaner_made_for_display/Think about it this way: 1440p monitors are 3.68 mpixels each, so 2x is 7.36mpixels. If that's 78% of bandwidth then your max bandwidth is about 9.44 mpixels.

4k is 8.29 mpixels. 1080p is 2.07 mpixels. Together that's 10.36mpixels. No go. It seems like your monitor has DP 1.2 so that you can hook up two of them if they're both running at 30Hz. (DP 1.2 actually uses a workaround to make the monitor run virtually as 2x 1920x2160 60Hz displays)

However, 7.36 mpixels + 2.07 mpixels = 9.43 mpixels, so *in theory* you can daisy chain it with your 1440p monitors. Cutting it a little close though since I was doing some rounding on the math, it may not work.

Running your TV at 720p may also work with either the 4k or 1440p daisy chain.Depends on your setup. If you've got an AMD APU that can do Crossfire with an AMD GPU, then yeah you can do that. Is that what you have?Depends on your setup. If you've got an AMD APU that can do Crossfire with an AMD GPU, then yeah you can do that. Is that what you have?Yes, but that shouldn't have anything to do with it.If the motherboard HDMI works with the GPU out, then that isolates the problem. Get back to us once you've done that.

You can also try removing one RAM stick at a time to see if one is bad.

I assume the GPU has its PCIe power connectors plugged in?I believe that the 330W under full load is actually for the full system in whatever benchmark you found, not just the GPU. The 380 can only pull 75W through each 6-pin PCIe connector, plus another 75W through the PCIe slot, so its theoretical max is 225W, and most models pull more like 195W at full load.

In theory 475W would be ok but cutting it close. HOWEVER: I believe the stock power supply in your system only has 1x 6-pin PCIe connector and you need two. 2x molex-to-PCIe 6-pin adapters are common but I wouldn't recommend using them, there's probably a reason your system doesn't have enough of the correct plugs.

If you didn't want to upgrade your PSU the best card you can get is a GTX 960, just make sure to get a model that only needs a single 6-pin PCIe connector. (Newegg specification tab shows this).Sure thing. Now just to return the RAM and have to wait for its replacement to come :(I'm not sure it will help or not. 

It's hard to find good details on the spec. My calculations above are more rough estimates, display port uses specific data rates that don't exactly correspond directly to resolution, plus there's the audio stream, etc. A 500W would be fine, even a good quality 450W really. I can recommend a few models.

Bare minimum quality/wattage: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-100b10500kr

Bare minimum quality/ higher wattage buffer: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-100b10600kr

Nice stuff below:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220gs0550v1 (modular)

So basically even though you have enough wattage, you're "cutting it close" because of the following things:

1. Unsure your power supply is actually capable of outputting what it claims it can. Only having a single 6-pin PCIe connector is a possible sign of this. It's a cheaper unit that hasn't undergone testing from hardware reviewers.

2. The video card pulls from the 12V rails on the power supply. Some power supplies have one big 12V rail putting out lots of amps, some have multiple smaller 12V rails. Your unit's label says it has 3 12V rails: +12V CPU @ 17.5A, +12V D @ 18A, and +12V B @ 17.5A, but then also says it can only put out a max of 38A (x12V = 456W)across all three of those. I don't know which of these rails the video card will be drawing from. If it's only one it's pretty close to the capacity for that one rail.If your power supply is &gt;500W: http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/xfx-video-card-r9380p4df5

or http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r7370gaming2gDepends on how high you want to go. There's a reason at a certain point people use phase cooling and elaborate water cooling setups. But for a standard overclock, yes.This is not a great price for this, see uk.pcpartpicker.com and compare to other GTX 960s.Do what I'd do and google "i5-4690k typical overclock air" without the quotes.Are you still using the stock power supply? Even if it fits, there's only a 300W power supply in there.Ok, in that case take /u/tractormonkey 's advice and measure the available space in the PCIe slot from the back panel to however far a card would fit. Assume 2 slots wide.The CPU's stock cooler comes with a preapplied thermal paste. For the stock cooler, it's good enough. People here in the US buy thermal paste for a few dollars but 10 EUR? No way. The difference is so small.

If there are no features on your motherboard that make you say "yes, I want this one" then go with mine, save the money.

I think a wireless keyboard/mouse is a better solution, but if you're looking for a USB active extension cable, maybe this one? http://www.amazon.it/Afunta-Hi-Speed-Repeater-Extension-Extender/dp/B008EGY698/ Italian selection is limited.

Edited the previous post for the RAM.I don't think I understand regarding your setup. Wireless keyboard/mice work for a long time now, batteries are good. How far away from the computer are you?

Hope you find an extender setup that works. You may have to try more than one to find a set that works well with your stuff. Glad I could help!PCIe is backwards compatible. It's like adding more lanes to a highway, but no current video card uses all the lanes anyway.That's fair.That should be close enough for a wireless setup to work no problem.

As long as that B85 motherboard hasn't been sitting on a shelf for 2 years, it should work ok.

Extending USB 3.0 is harder than 2.0, so it's good you'd be using a powered hub on your closer end. That will probably work.Try active, sure. I think active may be required past 2 monitors.Whoa dude there's a lot going on here.

First off, you can't just unpower the GPUs and expect it to work. You should remove them entirely and then try the motherboard port, or try them one at a time.

The fact that you got to the BIOS indicates that this may not be the problem, but: That motherboard is older than that CPU (Why did you buy such an old, expensive motherboard? Z97 is the newer kind that wouldn't have this issue), and will possibly need a BIOS update to work with that CPU. It needs the F9 BIOS or earlier. Unfortunately the only good way to do this is to use a CPU that *is* supported on your current BIOS, update it, then pop in your i7. The cheapest one is the Celeron G1820: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646g1820

What kind of hard drive is your old one? SATA? Slave/master only refers to old IDE hard drives. Also on a build this expensive I'd recommend an SSD as your OS/boot/programs drive.

High is not that much better than ultra. I'd say 60fps is much better than 40fps. Some people play at locked 30fps and that can be ok for some games, but you really want to maintain a steady 50-60 for most people.

If you're not planning on overclocking don't bother with the overclocking CPU. You need an aftermarket cooler to overclock it.

It didn't really need an upgrade unless it wasn't working or you're playing insanely CPU-heavy games. With an OC it hangs with newer i5s.

Hard drive will work fine, it's SATA2. (SATA is backwards compatible, your motherboard has SATA 3). CPU will not, it's a different socket.

Samsung 850 EVO 250GB sounds like it'll suit you, maybe a 500GB for ever-growing sizes of game installs. Games load faster on an SSD, it's nice. Keep your movies/tv shows/photos etc on a regular hard drive and use the SSD to boot the OS and load programs/games from.You can probably return them for a restocking fee if there's nothing wrong with them. This current one might have something wrong so you may be able to get a full return, idk. Maybe they'd flash it with a new BIOS for you. 

Dude if this computer is for gaming you're going way overkill on the RAM. 8GB is still enough for people who aren't crazy multitaskers. 16GB is plenty. Where did you read that you needed so much? Motherboards that have crazy high RAM capacity are meant for server/animation rendering/computation applications, not gaming.Please tell us the actual parts not just measurements.

It's probably to remove hard drive cages, not CD drive cages. CD drives are at the top of the case, video cards are in the middle/bottom.

You won't need more than 0.2" unless the PCIe power connectors face out that direction so you actually need more space to plug them in.All dual cores are not created equal. It'll run better on that dual core than an 860k. The i3 can split its dual cores into 4 virtual cores. It beats Phenom II hexa-cores in GTA V. http://www.techspot.com/review/991-gta-5-pc-benchmarks/page6.html

Go with this guy's build, he knows what he's doing. Change case to something a little cheaper if it's too much over budget.Pretty much any can be, but how much depends on how good the cooler is, how good your power supply is, if you win the silicon lottery.Sorry if it was there, didn't notice it. On that case you only need to remove the drive cages if you're using more than one GPU, they only block the PCIe slot length lower down.Ok, you'll need a socket 1150 motherboard with four RAM slots (at least 32GB capacity), with SLI support. Hmm...

or 

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-motherboard-gaz97mxgaming5

or

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-motherboard-z97gaming5

or this one if you still need EATX for some unmentioned reason:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-motherboard-152hre979krAll can do GPU pretty much. GPU doesn't even need the motherboard to do anything.PCIe 2.0 x1 is 500MBps upload and download, whereas USB 3.0 is 5 G**b**ps, or 625 MBps upload and download. Your wifi is probably not that fast.What are your temps ingame? What is your power supply? What is your CPU/GPU usage ingame?When you are attaching the CPU cooler, how are you tightening the screws? What pattern are you tightening again? Are you sure it's going down flat?Wait so did you already buy this stuff or no?Depends on the wiring in your home and the kit you buy.What are the cable/adapters you're using between your GPU and monitor?Older or less demanding games will be fine. Newer very-demanding games (Your GTAs, Far Crys, The Witcher 3, Fallout 4, etc) will play at reduced settings.

Your GPU will be the limiting factor in most games (except MMOs or Strategy Games)

I think right now the R7 360 (\u00a380)/R7 370 (\u00a3110) are a better deal, depending on the games you play the most, but they're all pretty close in value.First off, I assume you're going to overclock? Otherwise there are cheaper options for motherboard/CPU that will do just fine.

You probably want to get 2x8GB RAM sticks instead of 4x4GB. Cheaper, room for future upgrades. That CPU doesn't support quad-channel so there's no additional benefit from more sticks.

On the SSD, I'd either say save \u00a35 and go with the OCZ Trion 100 or pay \u00a35 and get the Samsung 850 Evo. It's faster and has a longer theoretical life. Neither matters that much but for \u00a35, go for it.

Cheaper motherboard with better reviews, close specs (slightly better onboard sound, equivalent onboard LAN, SLI/CF support, M.2 slot, USB 3.1 support)

Swapped power supply for a cheaper, equally good one.

What's your budget limit? What games do you play?The i7-6700K is an overclocking CPU (that's what the "K" at the end means) but the H110 motherboards are not capable of overclocking, that's what the Z170 motherboards are for. Do you plan on overclocking?

I found a Finnish website (I think it's like Finnish Amazon?) that carries PC parts at what seem to be ok prices, all with VAT included:

CPU: https://www.verkkokauppa.com/fi/product/61915/gbcmn/Intel-Core-i5-6600K-3-5-GHz-LGA1151-suoritin (299,90\u20ac)

Power Supply: https://www.verkkokauppa.com/fi/product/37424/dnsbt/XFX-Core-Edition-550-W-ATX-virtalahde-musta (73,90\u20ac)

For a grand total of 1247\u20ac. If you want to use more of your budget, feel free to switch back to the i7-6600K CPU, or the WD Blue drives back to Black, or upgrade the gpu to a GTX 970 or R9 390 (R9 390 I recommend a higher wattage power supply if you're overclocking.) Or use the remaining amount on a good 24" IPS monitor and keyboard/mouse.Ok, what about the RAM? \u20ac20 savings right there.

The reason I switched the motherboard is because a lot of people seem to have problems with the Asus Z170-A, more than other models.I think if \u00a3355 is okay with you, I'd get this R7 370: http://uk.pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r7370gaming2g

It's only 16% more expensive and about 40% more powerful than even an overclocked 750Ti. It's the competitor to the GTX 950.

http://www.techspot.com/review/1075-best-graphics-cards-2015/page2.html

Ok, so you know the i5-4460 recommended by the /u/SilentBobVG is not an overclocking setup. It's a good value but an overclocked setup can be too (if you OC it).

8GB would be fine for gaming, 16GB is nice if you're doing heavy video editing but for simple stuff it's ok. 4K is pretty demanding for even the most expensive of single-GPU setups. Newer games would be below 60fps on maxed settings, you could probably do medium-high which will still look good on 4k.

1440p is totally maxable. For $300 a lot more reasonable too.Check out /u/Not2Die2 's link, that's probably where I'd look too.

http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/ is a great review resource

In this price range there's no good reason to go AMD. The highest overclocked FX-6350 is about as fast as an underclocked i5-4690k.

Even if you went with an i5-4460 (non overclocking), it'd still be faster, and about the same price since you could eliminate the aftermarket cooler and get a cheaper motherboard.This R7 270 is a great price. It'll beat a 750Ti no problem:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/powercolor-video-card-axr92702gbd5tdheocCutting it too close on the power supply. RAM is needlessly pricey. Swapped to an i3 which means stock cooler is ok and cheaper motherboard possible. Swapped 280X to 380, which is a little newer, but you could upgrade that even further to a R9 380x or R9 390 and stay under budget. You could also swap CPU to an i5 for about $60 more.

However, since the R7 270 is a little older, its price is lower until they clear old stock, and it beats the 750Ti and the R7 360.I'm not a case fan expert, but that case comes with three fans (one top, one front, one rear), which is enough to start with. It has room for 4 more if you want.

Here's also an alternate build using the new Intel Skylake platform, which should be a little faster (2.7GHz Skylake is 10% faster than 3.2GHz Haswell), and uses newer DDR4:

There have been warping issues with certain aftermarket coolers, but since you're overclocking and they run so cool, you don't need one.Yes, pretty much any graphics card can support two monitors. Now the question is, what do you want to do with those two monitors? AMD graphics cards like the R9 390 can make 2+ screens appear as a single screen to the game so it shows on both screens, but for most games this is no good because your middle of the screen is the bezels of the two monitors. (Shooters, racing, 3rd person platformers). If you want to do that three monitors is better. Most people just use two monitors to have the game on one and web/music/game-related info on the other.Aw, shucks!Uh no, most Seasonic power supplies are better than most cheaper Corsairs. Corsair doesn't even make their own power supplies, they hire them out to companies like Seasonic to make them.3GB VRAM really shouldn't be an issue unless you're running mad texture packs. Most people report hitting 2GB with 2k texture packs and some other mods.i5-6500 is a good deal cheaper than the i5-6600 and only marginally slower. Save the money and use it elsewhere.

That video card is way overpriced, you can get a GTX 970 for that much. I put in an R9 380 but consider the R9 390.

Added an SSD.

It probably isn't too noticeable. You certainly have the room in the budget.There's always a bottleneck somewhere. I'd say a more powerful GPU could make sense though, I don't see any other spots that demand an upgrade.Well, I just said "unless you're running mad textures packs" and mods, so ok that's why.Keep in mind that you don't need the Z170 chipset (which allows overclocking), but for the price it's a nice full-featured board.Don't get a GT 740, that's not really worth upgrading to, and will not give you solid Fallout 4 performance.And also, they make these now:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LTAUTHEYep. You may need to turn settings down a bit for newer games to run at that resolution but it's still a lower res than 4k.Ok, so from the HD 5000 you'd get about a 50% bump in performance. Ok but I think you could do better. The GT 740 is a low-end graphics card, which often means you're getting less value than a midrange card, which are a little bit more money but a lot faster.

Is your goal "as cheap as possible" or do you have a budget?

It seems based on your parts list that you were willing to spend at least $65 on a GT 740, $50 for the cheapest Corsair 450W PSU depending on which model you meant, $170 on the thunderbolt adapter, and $70 on the other part. Minimum Total: $355. So I'll go with that.

Get that [Thunderbolt-&gt;PCIe adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LTAUTHE) for $217.

Get a [powered PCIe riser](http://www.amazon.com/PCIE-Powered-Flexible-Extender-Bitcoin/dp/B00GUKRX6S/), that's $7

Get a power supply, [this EVGA 500W](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-100w10500kr) is $40 without rebate.

That's $264, leaving $91 for a card. Let's say you can spend $90-100. My top pick would be the [R7 265](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-video-card-r72652gd5oc) for $100, but I'd go with either the [R7 360](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/xfx-video-card-r7360p2sf5) or [GTX 750Ti](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/pny-video-card-vcggtx750t2xpb). These cards are more like 300-400% faster for only a little more money.

EDIT: Here is a guide from someone else doing it, they recommend EVGA brand Nvidia cards, which would be a little more money. Here are some good ones. With either of these you could get away with this $27 power supply instead: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-100n10400l1

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-video-card-02gp43753kr

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-video-card-02gp42957krI'm only seeing 13% faster, which matches the real world results closely.Do you overclock at all?For 300\u20ac, consider this:

Can you mark the things you already own as purchased using the little gear thing on the pcpartpicker site?Try [Speccy](https://www.piriform.com/speccy)

We also need to know what power supply you have, which requires opening your case and looking at the box where your power cord plugs in.Touch a metal part of your computer case.Some of it is optional. I like to mount the CPU/RAM/CPU cooler to the motherboard first, then power supply, then video card, hard drives, CD/DVD Drives.Because GHz is a meaningless way of comparing two different architectures, and very few gaming use cases need more than 4 cores. The 3.3GHz (plus turbo) i5-4590 cores are about 30% faster than the 4.0GHz FX cores (plus turbo).Just give the part or model numbers of everything from Speccy

From the power supply we need the wattage and also the model, to make sure you have the right connectors and that the quality is sufficient.

PCI Express is backwards compatible and the old ones still have plenty of bandwidth for new cards, don't worry about it.That's an ok CPU upgrade but honestly not a massive one. What games are you seeing issues in? Are you sure it's your CPU? Max 1080p with 60fps might be a struggle for a 280x. You can get close but more of a mixed high-ultra probably.What's up with all the case upgrades? I'd say if my keyboard was missing strokes that'd be my first upgrade.

I feel like your problem might be that you feel there's always something better, so you're spending your money in a bit of an odd pattern. Don't fall victim to marketing.

I don't think you have to go from a cheap wireless kb to a nice mechanical, and many people are perfectly happy using a non-mechanical keyboard. I used one for 7 years, it was fine. At the same time, if you must have the best and you're going to waste money buying the middle option, then don't.

Upgrade your hardware if it no longer plays what you want how you want.Sorry, I'm not gonna d/l from that site at the moment. I can get back to you later.That's fine, just trying to get a feel for your build. It's not that risky it just needs to be done methodically.

Those other percentages are weighted and added up to create the overall percentage, because they don't matter equally. You wouldn't look at your report card with mostly Cs and two As and say you averaged As, you averaged a B-.Here's Fallout 4 CPU performance (no 4590 on here but I'd guess it falls between the i5-2500k and i5-4690k): 

http://www.techspot.com/review/1089-fallout-4-benchmarks/page5.html

Here's some raw benchmarks:

http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-4590-vs-AMD-FX-8350/2604vs1489Did you get a Core 1000 with the QC problems on the screws and tapped holes? I actually have one of those on my wife's PC (it was $20) but I got lucky and had no issues.For both of those games I think you're still more GPU-limited, or you have another issue entirely:

Smite I've heard has a bunch of optimization problems, but you could try reinstalling it or doing a clean GPU driver install.

You could try running a [UserBenchmark](http://www.userbenchmark.com/) (with all other programs closed) to see if there's anything amiss with your pc.Well, if you're hitting the VRAM limit, I guess GPU too, yeah?Wait you want a case or a motherboard?By that time the next gen cards should be out, but you'll probably be limited by your CPU if you go too nuts on the GPU.

Hope your employee discount is at least 20% because these prices suck butthole. Consider one of GPUs:

You also haven't told us much about the rest of the build, like what socket motherboard, what kind of RAM. What do you need 64GB of RAM for?

Or honestly just try the GPU first and see how it does.It's supposed to be right at the corner of your mouth, and is directional.And it's facing the right way?It's definitely less easy than a single card, it's more prone to frame rate issues and other performance problems. But I hear it's easier these days than it used to be, and has better scaling.

Are you on 1440p/4k? Otherwise I dunno if it's worth it.Anything you get with the same motherboard with the same performance will be about the same.

What motherboard do you have?Take a overall non-blurry picture of the inside of the case and post it here.Acer is a fine monitor manufacturer. I have an old 19" 1280x1024 TN secondary monitor that's still running since 2005/2006. They make everything from basic budget screens to really nice high-end monitors.

This motherboard is definitely cheaper so it'll have less features (cheaper realtek audio, cheaper realtek lan chip, less onboard ports) but it's a Gigabyte and they're pretty good.

Build looks good. GPU will probably require you to turn down settings a little in some games but it's a great value for the price.i3-4170/4160 + an H81 motherboard should run about $150, be cooler, and run faster.Ok so the info you're giving us about the parts you have isn't very complete. Can you run [UserBenchmark](http://www.userbenchmark.com/) and link us to the results here? Close all other programs before you run the file it has you download.

You'll also need to tell us what the power supply is. For that you need to open up the case and tell us the model number on the box inside that the wall power cord plugs into. A picture works too! Pictures are nice!

EDIT: And finally, tell us what games you play so we can target your upgrades for them.Underneath the mic foam is a hard structure, if you remove the foam you will see that it's got openings on one side to let your speech through. That side needs to be pointing near your mouth.

Also, what program are you using?Well, the 950 is about 30-40% faster and probably not 30-40% more expensive for you, I think it's a better deal, but I don't see what you pay at cost.Maybe try reinstalling the drivers for the USB sound card?Well, a 390 can do 1440p at slightly reduced settings without issue, I'd try that first. Consider waiting to see what the next gen holds.I don't think the mic on these headset is supposed to be the best, but it is supposed to be audible.Yes, fairly high settings.

The motherboard upgrade is only worth it if you want the additional features.Ok yeah you've definitely got something running in the background. It could be antivirus, it could be an actual virus/spyware, or something else. Run an antivirus scan and malwarebytes and also view CPU usage in the task manager to see if it's anything obvious.

Don't sweat your stuff being in the red/yellow on UserBenchmark, it's comparing your stuff with top-of-the-line gear. Your boot drive is fine, you don't need an SSD although that's a recommendation I'd make for your upgrade as they've gotten pretty cheap.

Graphics card tech moves pretty fast, yours isn't that bad. If you were to buy a new one to be better you'd still have to spend $60+. It will definitely struggle with GTAV/Witcher 3, which are some of the most demanding new titles. Skyrim is like 4 years old now.

I don't think your CPU will hinder you from getting solid frame rates in the Witcher, but it may slightly in GTAV. Still should be playable though.

That is a photo of the power supply but I need to see the whole label on the side, not just the bar code/bar code number. That's not the model #. The whole PC picture would work but the light is low so it's pretty grainy and hard to read.

Get some canned air to blow that dust out. Don't vacuum near your parts, it could cause a static shock, but you can vacuum up dust that blows out.

Let me get back to you with some recommended upgrades.[PCPartPicker part list](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/66TwLk) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/66TwLk/by_merchant/)

Here's what I would do if I had your whole budget to work with. Could go cheaper and still get decent performance, but with this you wouldn't need to upgrade again for a while.No, I just mean blow the stuff out of your case and then you can vacuum.

What process is using a lot of CPU in task manager? Just whatever the name of it is.Happy to help. It's what this place is for.

Well, your current GPU wasn't $60 when he bought it, I mean an equivalent new GPU would cost that much. You want something better.

I'd prioritize the GPU and power supply first, maybe RAM. That will make The Witcher 3 playable. The GPU I suggested will be good for The Witcher on high/ultra settings, we could drop you down to an R9 380 or GTX 960 instead and that'd still be pretty good.

You don't need a new case, that's optional but probably nice to have. You could get a nice replacement for about $60.

Here's a provisional "halfway there" upgrade that will get you to a playable state in your games.

Windows explorer always runs, so that's normal. Firefox being used while it's closed is troubling though, it leads me to believe maybe you have a malicious plugin. Run MalwareBytes free to check. The rest of the running things are ok.Yep GPU (Graphics processing unit) = graphics card.

I'd say try these things first. They should get you into a running state once you figure out the background CPU stuff.

There are definitely red cases, although you might have less options/higher prices. Here's a good one from an easy-to-use/good airflow perspective, although the aesthetics might not be for everyone: http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/nzxt-case-caph410r1It probably shouldn't kill those Firefox plugins if they're good, but make sure none have the same names.

With the cleaning I'd say every couple of months is ok, but maybe just eyeball it every once in a while to see if it's due.Don't do it just for Gsync, do it for IPS.That's a really expensive GTX 970. They can be found cheaper. Get a better power supply. Different motherboard, consider a cheaper CPU cooler.I took this and went with a cheaper overclocking motherboard, cheaper/faster RAM that doesn't take up all your slots, added a 250GB SSD for fast boots/game loads, switched to the 2TB Green drive (which is actually cheaper than the 1.5TB), and switched to a cheaper DVD/CD drive:

It also has front/backplates for rigidity I guess, high-end capacitors, more hard drive ports, and the fans, and fancy software to control stuff, and a 5-year warranty. They basically threw everything but the kitchen sink in there.

Plus marketing.Yes, but it depends on the games you play and the resolution you play at, neither of which you've told us.Whatever's cheap and has good reviews.I think an i7 is nice. You could also look into a Xeon E3, which is basically an i7 with the onboard GPU turned off. The E3 1231v3 is like $240, and it's only marginally slower than the i7-4790 (0.2 GHz slower base rate/turbo). The E3 1241v3 is the same but 0.1 GHz faster for $20 more. The difference between the three won't be noticed.

You can't fully utilize RAM rated at faster than DDR3-1600 on that motherboard anyways, might as well save the $5. (ignore if you end up grabbing a Z97 motherboard)

Everything else looks good.

It probably uses PWM LED strobing as opposed to proper dimming to change brightness and the strobing is giving you the issues. Or since it looks like your old display was LED too, maybe just a different PWM frequency that you find more problematic.

Edit: A related link. http://crispycromar.com/psa-led-backlighting-can-cause-migraine-headaches/&gt; BenQ GW2765HT

Interestingly enough, that model does not use PWM specifically to eliminate this issue. This tweet from a trusted online monitor reviewer:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/nanoxia-case-nxds3bYes a Xeon is literally the same chip. Single core is only worse by the percentage of Ghz it is slower, so it's about 5% slower, but it's 20% cheaper. Basically the same speed.

I mean whatever, it's only a $5 difference on the RAM.No, because then people would have to make their game look like total crap to be competitive, some people want it to look decent and be competitive and have the hardware to do so.Games aren't really fully utilizing 4 cores anyways, surely one can handle the streaming.No, but you will probably be bottlenecked by your CPU and RAM, so I'd aim to upgrade those next.Only Z170 socket 1151 motherboards currently support SLI. It's unclear if this is a hardware limitation due to the number of lanes or a specs limitation by Nvidia.Seems like a perfectly good PC to me.Not seeing pricing for the RAM/Video Card. It's possible the existing R9 280 stock will be cleared before Christmastime, but that's ok. GPU prices always drop over time.

You're spending an awful lot on the motherboard, and that CPU isn't very cost effective in AU. Corsair CX power supplies are popular because they're cheap but they're also not the best-made compared to other ones.

It also lets you run in dual-channel mode but that doesn't affect gaming performance on Intel CPUs much. If a 2x4 set is about the same price when you go to buy, go for it.

More cores is better in theory but for most games it's better to have a few fast cores rather than a bunch of slow cores. (You can't compare Ghz between Intel and AMD CPUs, and AMD cores are much slower right now). Most games only use 1-2 threads heavily and then might have another thread or two used a little. An i3 processor handles this pretty well with hyperthreading, which "splits" each of the two cores, making it sorta a quad-core on the fly. Not as fast as an i5, which is a True quad-core without hyperthreading, but it's surprisingly close, and much cheaper.

For example, [CPU performance in The Witcher 3](http://www.techspot.com/review/1006-the-witcher-3-benchmarks/page5.html). It's a slower i3 and a faster AMD chip (the FX-6350), but the i3 is still faster.CPU upgrade won't help except for mmos and other CPU-killing games. Plenty of RAM. Graphics card upgrade usually helps the most but your card is already close to top-of-the-line so upgrading is cost prohibitive for limited gains unless you're running high resolutions.
Pcpartpicker lets you filter for socket and SLI support. There are ~~15-20~~ [30ish supported z170 boards.](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/motherboard/#l=2&amp;xcx=0&amp;s=30)Basically, the CPU you want to buy is newer than the motherboard you have. So the motherboard's "firmware", the BIOS, may not have the code needed to recognize this newer CPU.

But you're in luck! You already have a CPU that works, so you can update your BIOS to support the new one.

Disclaimer: that CPU is not in your [motherboard's official support list](http://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/970%20Extreme3/?cat=CPU), but the internet seems to think it will work if you upgrade the BIOS.Every PCIe GPU pretty much as long as your power supply has enough juice to power it. Since you have not provided us with your power supply model, we cannot tell you.I get that the Xeon has hyperthreading but since it's a locked multiplier why not just drop down to a i5-4460 and save another $60? It works with the H81 too.Yes, PCIe is backwards compatible, and an R7 250 does not come close to saturating the bandwidth of a PCIe 2.0 x16 slot.

However, don't expect too much increased performance from your upgrade. You're jumping from an old top-of-the-line card to a newer lower-midrange card. The increased VRAM will help on today's games, and it will be way more efficient, but it may not be an earth-shattering upgrade.

If you're in the US, right now the R7 250X can be had for the same price as the 250 ($62) and is 50% faster, and the R7 260X is about $20 more ($82) for about twice as fast. [Maybe go that route?](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/video-card/#sort=a8&amp;page=1&amp;c=163,164,79,109,131,81,82,110,150,161,162,149,168,308)Keep the i5-2500K, overclock if you haven't already. Spend everything on the GPU, get a 980Ti. Done. Get a bigger SSD if you want, like an 850 Evo or a Crucial MX200.

Worrying about performance in a game that isn't even out yet is silly. It's an upgraded Skyrim engine, pretty sure their recommended specs are inflated. If your Adobe performance isn't where you want, consider an upgrade on the CPU/RAM i guess.Yeah that game is a GPU hog. Grab a 256GB/512GB SSD and a 1/2TB WD Blue drive and you're good.Marginally slower at stock speed:

[Witcher 3 CPU Benchmark comparison with a regular 980](http://www.techspot.com/review/1006-the-witcher-3-benchmarks/page5.html)

[GTAV with a Titan X](http://www.techspot.com/review/991-gta-5-pc-benchmarks/page6.html)

[A bunch of other games with various CPUs and GTX 980](http://www.techspot.com/article/1039-ten-years-intel-cpu-compared/page5.html)Yeah, what 32 bit setting are you talking about? Are you sure this isn't another "32-bit" setting entirely?Yeah that Pentium only needs an H97 board for overclocking, unlike the -K i5/i7 chips.No one knows what will give acceptable frame rates in Fallout 4, we just have recommended specs. But probably not Ultra/Very High settings, yes.You're ok but cutting it close, provided that your power supply is a decent brand. If it's not a decent brand, or is  old (&gt;5 years), please do yourself a favor and upgrade it.

100W for CPU
140W for GPU
That NZXT is the classiest case I could imagine that still has a window and a color accent on the outside.Maybe this Enermax, it actually has good reviews too:

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811124156

Looking makes me realize there aren't as many bright, colorful cases these days, I remember there used to be tons of Apevias and even Antecs that were pretty colorful.

This is a good option if you can find it anywhere:
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA24G28M3693You should be ok. That case doesn't have a bottom vent for the power supply so you'll also be using that to suck air in from the case and blow it out the back.

More fans won't hurt, but they may not help much. Yup, that will be a fast PC, and looks like good value high-end parts.

You could switch to the inno3d 980Ti and save \u20ac25, but that's about it, and MSI is a good brand. (I don't think we have inno3d in the USA, so I can't comment)Yep.It doesn't matter that much if you're just gaming.

If you're just gaming and not playing demanding MMOs an i7 is a waste of money though. An i5 will do just fine.Tell us what resolution monitors you have, not which resolution monitors you don't have.It's a starter pack with some unlocks and boosts.What resolution monitor? This system will be fine for most things on 1080p but won't 60fps The Witcher 3 at 1080p.

This build is relatively weak on the GPU for how much you're paying, generally the most important component for games. (Less so for an MMO like Wildstar but still) There's a deal today where you could bump up the GTX 960 and save some money.

SSD is fine, but you have no other hard drive so you're going to run out of space soon. This is something you could buy and upgrade yourself to save money, or just add on a 1TB Western Digital Blue

You could drop the motherboard down to another model for about 80 bucks and only lose SLI support, which at this price point you don't need.

The power supply is oversized for the system by about 300W, and of unknown (crappy) brand. Bump it down to a known model in the 500W range
Upgrading that is entirely up to you, but we need to know what resolution you're running to recommend parts. I like the build /u/Title_Fight_ put together except for the power supply, which is made by a so-so OEM.I think this system will be close to your target res/frame rate as it is, temp issues aside. Those reference cooler GTX 760 models are known to run hot. 

GPU upgrade is probably best bet, like an R9 380 or maybe a closeout deal on an R9 290. RAM is probably ok to be honest. Another vote for #1, but both are good.That's a great GPU. You can also switch to the faster "EVGA Superclocked ACX 2.0 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB GDDR5" for -$1, but it does say that's a "today-only" deal. Normally people on here recommend the R9 390 over it, but on this site that one is more expensive.

That power supply is made by Seasonic for XFX, so it should be pretty good.

Another thing I noticed is you can switch to 2x8GB RAM sticks instead of 4x4GB for free. I'd recommend this, it would allow room for later upgrades and have little to no performance impact.6GB RAM is a much less common configuration, so I'd imagine 8GB kinda means "more than 4GB". We won't know until it comes out if that's the case. That said, switching to dual-channel would be fine if you want to go to 8GB or 16GB.

With regard to the video card, you could look for an aftermarket cooler or watercooling setup, like these:

The rest of the system matters a lot too and you haven't told us anything about it.I'd recommend the R7 250X over the other one, newer and a bit faster.

However, you're trying to go a little too cheap on the CPU, that thing is not fit for gaming. I'd recommend a Pentium G3250 and a cheap H81 motherboard at the very least.

You can go lower on the power supply, you don't need 600W, 450W is overkill but safe. Go down to 1x4GB of RAM for now, you've got bigger problems.

This should be a bit more capable:

What games or programs did the other pc do better at? Are your computer temps normal under load? Do you have the same resolution monitors?It looks like a different cooler, but I can't find any reviews of it and they don't sell that brand where I live. Maybe there are some Deutsche Sprache reviews?Look at your CPU and GPU utilization and temps during a game.

The game is running on the smaller monitor? What size monitor does your friend have?LOL. I like how they associate a rise in violent crime in one half-year in one city to releasing nonviolent offenders statewide. 

Also it's our taxes and our environmental laws. Not, you know, a huge population, heavily-driven roads, non-homogeneous demographics.

It's all because of rich liberalz starving the poor people, duh! Why with a low-tax climate, there would be tons of nice steel factories and lumberyards for them to work in! And our roads would be all paved with these lower taxes!See the above reply. Crime rates didn't rise, LAPD was gaming the stats to look like they were improving, then stopped (or at least cut back). It might have been an opportune time with the passage of that law to do so, since it would defer the "blame", but that's just my speculation.

I agree there's room for improvement, but honestly I don't think high utility prices and the like are to blame. There is subsidized pricing for core utilities if you're below certain income levels (CARE), and tax brackets for state income tax. Higher utility prices across the board ensure that demand is controlled. We lose a relevant amount of tax revenue from tax sheltering by our large tech and entertainment corporations.

California receives the most federal spending of any state, but one of the lowest compared to our population and GSP (GDP but for states).Yes, I agree that having an approval voting system or similar would make sense in a mostly-blue state, rather than choosing safe Democratic incumbents every time. Odds are it would be the same result most of the time, but a little more flexible.I have totally voted and noticed this system yet misread your comment and confused myself.

Drinking and Redditing, kids. Don't do it.Well, I guess gas prices were getting too low!You check what power supply/motherboard you have by looking up your model number, which should be on a sticker somewhere. Power supply will greatly impact the maximum card we can recommend.

Barring that, you can open up your case. The power supply is a largish cube either gray or black where your power cord plugs in. Usually there is a datasheet stuck to it with its wattage stats, it may also have the brand. Take a pic of that if you can.

To measure how long of a card you can fit, measure the distance between the backplate of your current video card (where your monitor plugs in) to whatever would get in the way if it were longer and wider.

Considering the low-end current graphics card, it probably isn't a very high-wattage power supply. You could safely buy a 750 Ti, which has very low power requirements. The GTX 950/960 might also be possible. The GTX 970 is less likely to work both because of size and power needs. Let us know about your power supply and length and then we can recommend more.

to clarify: "at least **3** tiers"That's entirely speculative. To extrapolate from recent trends, each previous generation's top-of-the-line card gives roughly the performance of the next gen's 2nd-from-the-top. Sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less.And also, since there are no benchmarks no one really knows what it needs to run well. Everyone's just guessing based off the requirements the company released.Your enthusiasm is great. There's a lot of info and builds in your price range already designed if you search, that might help you find a jumping-off point. Please read the FAQ. 

What parts does your budget include? Just PC itself or monitor and peripherals?

The card you've selected is a bit overpriced for what it is right now, it's about 10% faster than a standard 750 Ti, but costs $30-40 (30-40%) more./r/hardwareswap has some German users and can be sorted by country.They must be, unless they really went to town on the Skyrim engine. The requirements they published imply it's the next Crysis or something.Your CPU barely meets minimum spec, but it's more the recommended settings that seem high, not the minimum.Spend $110 on CPU (i3), $50 on the motherboard (H81), $40 on RAM (1x8GB), $50-65 on power supply, $140-170 on GPU, $40-60 on a case. If you can afford any more spend it on the GPU.It could be many things, but first off:

Make sure the GTX 960 is seated correctly in the slot. Make sure it's getting the 6-pin power connector from your power supply. Is the fan on it spinning up when you turn on the PC?They'll do. Looking up your power supply model it only has one 6-pin PCIe connector, so you will be limited to graphics cards that only need that. So the GTX 970 is out unless you upgrade your power supply, and that'll lower your remaining budget.

If you're sticking with your current power supply, go for the GTX 960, GTX 950, R7 270, or R7 370. (In descending order of performance).

Or you could spend $60-70 on a new power supply and use the rest to get an R9 380 or R9 280, which is a little faster than the GTX 960.I said your CPU barely meets minimum spec, because the minimum is a stock sandy bridge i5 and you're rocking an overclocked sandy bridge i5. Easy buddy, your rig is fine. I have an i5-2500K too.Just go with what's cheap and make sure that specific model doesn't have bad reviews. Sometimes even a good manufacturer has a sub-par model.You definitely will or will not be able to run it.Ok, it's not necessarily the GPU. Do you have more than one RAM stick? Can you try taking one out at a time and seeing if it works on just the other one?Format that plz, it's unreadable.Don't bother upgrading your CPU unless you need it for non-gaming stuff.The inside is the same, on one the entire front of it is mesh on the other it's got air intakes on the sides of the front, and the power button/usb/audio front ports are in different places. Entirely up to your preference.He said no AMD because he wants it quiet.That case has bad reviews, get one with better reviews.Probably from just eyeballing it, but you'd have to measure it like I advised to be sure, and assume it's taking up 2 slots not one.The video card alone is worth about 150 GBP new. It's probably worth it if it's in good shape. You couldn't build a better system for cheaper.Yeah, get that HDD.These?

http://de.pcpartpicker.com/part/nzxt-case-caph240w1Yes, it's fine, but I think you're missing my point. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm saying the only difference between it and minimum spec is clock speed. Minimum spec has nothing to do with how good your CPU actually is.Damn. Is the CPU seated properly? Do you have another GPU you could try out/does your motherboard/CPU have integrated graphics you could try?Ok, if you have 4 the only thing to worry about is that sometimes motherboards don't like certain slots left full/empty. You should consult your motherboard manual to make sure you got it right, and maybe just try one of the 4 sticks in at a time.Whoa, no onboard? What CPU/motherboard are you rocking?Ah.Everything else is good for gaming. An SSD would be a good addition for load times and general snappiness.Switch to this wifi card: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-wireless-network-card-gcwb867di Intel chip and $10 cheaper.

Yes, you could run fine without the 2TB hard drive and the GPU, and the prices for both might go down in the future. Your selected motherboard, which is micro ATX size, will not fit in a Mini-ITX case, so the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv is not an option. The other two are good if you're set on white. Remember that if you get onewith a window, the wire routing you do will be visible. Since that power supply is non-modular, you'll have to do extra work to hide the cables you're not using.

Go with this SSD for slightly more size, $10 less: 
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-internal-hard-drive-ct250bx100ssd1

If you're doing editing work, more RAM is nice. You can get 16GB for about $68.
Yes.Do you need a separate wired networking adapter? You've already got one on the motherboard.

That's a pretty costly SSD. Honestly you could get away with smaller and then another hard drive to store media and games that you don't care about fast loads on, but if you do want a 1TB, go with the Crucial BX100. Also switched the Fractal R4 case with the R5, which has a better air filter setup but otherwise almost the same, and it's cheaper. Build here:

Marketing.Yes, the common consumer sizes are EATX, ATX, MicroATX, Mini-ITX (largest-smallest). You can put a smaller motherboard in a bigger case though.I agree, but let's not forget that they usually unlock higher graphics settings on the PC, so it should be more demanding.Which R9 200 series do you have? Going to a 390 isn't much of an upgrade from a 290, and not worth the money.Why such expensive peripherals and such cheap hardware? I get that it's competitive but there are perfectly competitive, cheaper KB+mice out there. I'd suggest going cheaper there and bumping up your CPU to a Pentium Dual Core at the very least.

What games are you trying to run?It won't make a ton of difference in games but you could see 10-20% fps improvement. 2nding the R9 290/390, although the GTX 970 is a good, efficient option as well.It's not bad, it's just not particularly fast. If the 750Ti works for you, I don't see an issue sticking with it, especially because it uses so little power, roughly 60W vs the R7 270's 95W during gaming. With 10 machines that might matter to you.There are some decent Steelseries and Roccat options that are a little more affordable. I have a Roccat Savu (technically a 4 button + button modifier button) that I got for $40 but I see it's $80 now.Rules:

Be respectful to others

**Don't ask to be spoonfed a build.**Which model 280x do you have?You don't need to upgrade your CPU unless you're doing stuff besides gaming.Looks good to me.Your GPU drivers, not your monitor drivers.What brand and model? R9 280X is just the chip. Each manufacturer makes their own specific models with their own coolers and PCB layouts, some have different outputs (some have 1 HDMI and 3 DP, some 2 DVI and one each HDMI and DP.)

For example "Sapphire R9 280X Tri-X Toxic" or "MSI R9 280X Gaming 3G Twin Frozr"

You probably can find this from [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/) if you don't want to search your email for the order info.Your CPU is pretty good and 8GB of RAM is enough, but you should buy a new power supply, at least 500W.

This one would do just fine and not break the bank, but there are nicer options if you don't mind spending extra:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-120g10650xrRead the rules.Sometime between Q1 2016 and Q1 2017, probably.GTX 970 still needs two 6-pins, sometimes one 6-pin and one 8-pin.Ok, so for the monitor to work at 144Hz, you have to be on the ~~black~~ on some models maybe red DVI port that says "VGA" next to it. It's a dual-link DVI-I port. The other one is a single-link DVI-D port. So make sure it's plugged into that one and then disconnect your other monitors and give it a go? 

When you google AMD 144hz there are a fair amount of people having similar issues with this monitor and AMD cards.

Another possibility is a bad DL-DVI cable I guess, but DVI cables rarely go bad.Yes, it does, but you are having a hardware or driver issue preventing you from enabling it.

Video cards have supported high refresh rates for a long time, as long as the monitor EDID tells the GPU it supports it and the right cables are used.The FAQ asks for the build because we need to know the motherboard size and how long the GPU is, jeez.

Also: Color? Do you want a window? Does he want to take it to LAN parties? Big and roomy to work in or small and compact to be inobtrustive?Glad it's working. Go to bed.We need more info. Post your system specs before/after please.Ha, I have the same CPU and motherboard. Overclock the CPU if you're comfortable, I agree on the SSD and GPU upgrade front. Make the SSD the boot drive and keep most of the games on your 2TB drive.You can save more than $13 on the i5-4460, at least $30 cheaper. Same with the motherboard, the H97 motherboards have much cheaper options.

I also recommend switching to the Western Digital Blue instead of the Black, the difference really doesn't help gaming. If you want responsiveness, add an SSD to your build.

And don't get a CX series power supply when you're spending this much money on a build, get something higher quality.Any reason why you randomly replaced half of the components without knowing what the problem was?

Could be the CPU, since that's the same. When you say you tried different cables, do you mean the cables to your monitor from your video card?Swapped the AMD CPU for an i3 and compatible motherboard, bumped up to a faster but cheaper AMD graphics card.

Either way, don't expect 1080p 60fps on high on the newest games like Witcher 3, Far Cry 4, GTAV, etc. NZ's pricing means this is a relatively budget system. Medium 60fps 1080p on these games might be possible, and will still look nice. This will crush older games though.

I'd also suggest this case, as it has some cable routing provisions built in, and it's cheaper: http://nz.pcpartpicker.com/part/silverstone-case-sstps11bw

If you're set on the GTX 970, you've got the budget for it, and you could do a larger SSD.Worth a go. You can usually tell by how many pins there are on the the cable. DL-DVI should have all of the little clustered pins.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/DVI_Connector_Types.svg/277px-DVI_Connector_Types.svg.pngLike I said, feel free to switch back to the 970 now that you've got the room in your budget. The R9 290 is a better deal right now, the two are pretty close in performance. +/-10% depending on the game and what resolution/settings you use. I have the MSI GTX 970 4G "Twin Frozr" and I like it a lot. The silent mode is cool.

It can be done, but I would not recommend using an external drive to store anything beyond media or backups. An SSD will speed up load times but honestly just having Windows and your most-played games. Keep the 1TB Western Digital Blue to hold the rest of your games, it's a fast hard drive. 

Actually, the 240GB version of that SSD is only $20 more, so just go with that:

Wow a bunch of things went down in price since yesterday!

The i5-4690 is 25% more expensive than the 4460 and only 10% faster, I don't think it's worth it. That extra speed won't help much in most games anyways.Yes, we need more info. Give us your current system specs.Or just do a search for "budget" sorted by age, or "$600"I think the GTX 970 has slightly lower overhead, but the R9 390 (or 290, almost the same and cheaper) is a better value.This build is good, but I'd probably swap the CPU for the cheapest i5 and a cheap H97/H81 motherboard for almost the same amount of money.You don't even have to reinstall, it's the same drivers.

But to be thorough or if it's acting weird, after you install the 980Ti, just reinstall them. Or to be really thorough, use a driver cleaner then install the driver.What kind of RAM? DDR2 or DDR3?

Depending on if your RAM is DDR2 or DDR3, find a used socket 775 motherboard on /r/hardwareswap or eBay with that kind of RAM slots. Pop the Pentium Dual Core E5300 CPU in that baby. Do you have a CPU cooler lying around? Buy one if not for $20.

Get a power supply that's at least 600W with at least one 8-pin PCIe connector and one 6-pin PCIe connector.

Get a Mini-displayport-to-DVI or HDMI adapter if you don't have one already.

This will be pretty CPU limited but will be enough for older/low requirement games. As an alternative pick up a newer Pentium G series and cheap H81 motherboard or maybe an AMD Athlon X4 860K LOL @ upgrading a GTX 970 to an R9 390. That's a sidegrade.Yeah, it's good. Kinda need to know that before we proceed.I guess that's an ok deal. I mean it's a good deal on that model but there are cheaper new fm2+ motherboards. If you need the wifi go for it, and pair it with an Athlon X4 860K.

Maybe go with a power supply like this? http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-120g10650xrYou are overspending on a Z97 motherboard, don't need a Z if you don't have an i5 model that ends in K. Save 50 bucks there and spend it on your video card and power supply, recommending an R9 380 and something like this:

https://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-power-supply-rs550amaag1s1Yep.Hmm...Can you reset your BIOS using the pin header? Maybe that will do something. How to do this should be in your motherboard manual.Are you doing that thing where you pretend to forget what something is called to denigrate it?You mean like boycotting movies? Super constructive and not petty.&gt; LC420H-12

Oooh. Yeah that will limit your options a little. That's not a great power supply.

My recommendation:
Buy another 4GB of DDR3 1600 RAM for a total of 8GB, preferably the same model.

Buy a better psu, then buy an R9 380 or GTX 960If you aren't missing the extra graphix, don't worry about it. They're pretty close in performance anyways, just one price tier apart.You don't need to buy a separate video card if you're just doing office work. You could just use the onboard graphics of the Intel CPU. The motherboard you've chosen is $41.40 and has a VGA port and a DVI port. 

If you need more ports (you can use up to 3 if you have them) or don't want to use VGA, then you could spend some of the $62.98 you save on the R7 240 on a slightly more expensive motherboard like http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-motherboard-h81ma to get an additional HDMI out.

Planning on doing a little gaming after all and you can ignore the above.Yes but this CPU is better and you now have just one big SSD. My vote is to keep the big SSD rather than the small SSD+Hard drive, ditch the GPU, and decide if the faster CPU is worth it to you or not.Your computer is fine to get fast internet, your motherboard has a gigabit (1 Gigabit/s aka 125MegaByte/s) ethernet port. You might need a new modem, which is the thing that plugs into your cable line. How fast is your internet? A Motorola Surfboard SB8141 will probably do.

Your computer meets BO3 minimum specs, so you're good there.

I'd probably bump your motherboard/CPU up to an i3-4160 and a cheap H81/H97 motherboard. Any graphics card upgrade you can do for under $200 isn't really worth it, but make that your next upgrade down the line.

For gaming it won't be much difference. I used to buy motherboards thinking I'd upgrade the CPU later, but usually by that time there's some new hotness out and it's best just to upgrade CPU/Motherboard/RAM all at once.

If you do want to go that route it's another $30 for the motherboard.Professional gaming? What game? What resolution? What's your budget?Yes, but not on high-ultra settings.What resolution and what video card do you have?/r/buildapcforme or just go to Falcon Northwest or Origin PC or iBuyPower if money is no option.

You want a big mean Intel i7 or Xeon setup, 32 GB of RAM, additional graphics cards will not help your render times in x264 encoding.Return the case. Some weird issue from the standoffs might be shorting your motherboard? Idk.At this resolution it should be fine, still below 1440p-level pixels.You're getting a non-K CPU with a Z97motherboard. This is unnecessary, the Z is more expensive than the H97.

If you're buying headphones that nice you should have an external amp or a sound card.

If you're mostly gaming just get the cheapest 8GB RAM set you can, or consider getting a 1x8GB stick to upgrade later.

Get the 250GB Crucial BX100 SSD instead, almost the same price.Yes, it works with your RAM, graphics card, case, hard drives, and power supply.

Actually though, there's a combo deal right now for this nicer motherboard and the same CPU:

The problems usually arise when you try to dual channel two RAM sticks with different chips. Since you'll have two sets they'll be matched with their twins, not with the other set, so no prob. Just make sure you put them in the correct RAM slots to do this. (usually it's put the same ones in the same color slots, but check your motherboard manual).

You could even buy a completely different size/brand set with the same speed if you wanted, like a 2x8GB DDR 1600 CAS 9 set from Crucial or Corsair or whatever.This is stronger on both CPU and GPU, with a CPU that can handle streaming. Still not as nice a GPU as you need for GTAV and BO3 on high, but faster than the 750Ti. If you want to go down to 680 GBP, switch the case to the Fractal Design Core 1000 USB 3.0. It's not as nice a case, but I've worked with it and I like it.

Then if you have money in a year or two, you can upgrade your GPU and the rest of your system will still be good.

Its components are probably not very good as well, and it may not even reach its rated capacity before failing during regular use. Prebuilts like the one you bought use them to cut corners because buyers don't know any better.

Get a decent brand (EVGA, Antec, Seasonic, Super Flower, Silverstone, XFX, Corsair), something like this: 

http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-110b10750vr

What's your video card budget?If you're not building it until next year, the recommendation will change by then, probably.There are GTX 960s under 10", you could go that route: 

http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/video-card/#l=69,254&amp;c=208&amp;sort=a8&amp;page=1

Or the R9 380, which is slightly faster than the GTX 960. This one is under 9 inches, and its power connectors are on top so they won't be in the way: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/powercolor-video-card-axr93804gbd5ppdhe 

What's your PSU? Even if it's 500W I wouldn't run this card on a cheapo unit.That video card is waaay overpriced. 4GB of DDR3 RAM on a low-end GPU is just a marketing gimmick. For the money, get one of these instead, both of which use the still-generous 2GB of faster GDDR5. They'd be a huge step up in performance.

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/zotac-video-card-zt7060110m

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/powercolor-video-card-axr7260x2gbd5dhv4I also wouldn't recommend that power supply. The rest of your system depends on it, so it's not good to cheap out. The rest of Corsair's line is pretty good but the build quality on the CX series is not the best.

This one is a great deal after rebate right now, made by Seasonic: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/xfx-power-supply-p1550sxxb9Consider the R9 380 GPU in that price range. Any more expensive card will be held back by your CPU anyways. There's also this power supply if you don't care about having modular cables, a bit cheaper: 

http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-100b10500krModular or semi-modular just means the regular power supply cables can be removed, so if you're not using all of them (you usually aren't unless you have like 8 hard drives and 2 video cards), they don't require you to cable manage them to hide them away lest they be visibly loose and getting in the way in your case.

This graphics card is roughly 7x the processing power of an R7 240. That doesn't mean 7x the fps, but expect ~70fps in DX:HR at max with AA on 1080p, with probably your CPU holding you back from going any higherThe Witcher 3 eats GPUs alive. To play it on the highest setting, grab a 980Ti and an i5, either 4000 series or 6000 series.

If so, that rules out the 290/390, because it specifies a 600-750W PSU depending on the model.

I'm not sure what you mean by the GPU acting like an intake fan? Did you mean exhaust fan? The only way it could intake is if the GPU stretches all the way to the front to pull out of the front bottom vent.

Sorry, all prices were without VAT/DPHOr this 290 for $70 less: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/sapphire-video-card-100362srThe amount of VRAM is not how you shop for a video card, the chipset matters most. **Which 7800 series do you have?**

I'd guess your current GPU could already play current/next gen games at medium quality, as it's somewhere between a GTX 750Ti/R7 360 and a GTX 960/R7 370X in performance.

The only upgrade in your price range that might be worth it is a R9 380, but depending on which 7800 series you have, may not be much of an upgrade.

/r/buildapcforme. Playing the older games will not be a problem at all, they'll run on a $400 computer.It's 50 EUR more. Surely you can look at Slovakian computer websites? I don't think it's worth the additional cost.I'd recommend you wait for benchmarks or to try the game out first. The published system requirements are not a measure of how well something actually runs. To meet their recommended requirements you'd have to spend over 300EUR on a card.

An R9 380 would not be that big of an upgrade, it's about 30% faster. If you're getting 40fps in a game now, at the same settings you'd get 55fps maybe.You meet the minimum requirements, so you already know you can run it, probably at low or medium settings. Then if it's not to your liking, you can order a new card and have it a few days later, install it and play at medium-high settings.Well, we won't really know until benchmarks come out. Going off their recommended specs it's 300EUR+ assuming you have a 1080p monitor.Yes, those are the official recommended specs that I've been basing my recommendations off of.  You can't even buy the 780 new anymore, the 970 is its newer equivalent. Maybe buying used you could get cheaper.

I feel like you're not really listening.I'd recommend changing the SSD to a Crucial BX100 250GB for almost the same price.

Could save a few $ by going with one of these two power supplies:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/seasonic-power-supply-ss350etbronze (350W is enough for this build, even 300W would probably be ok)

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-100b10500kr

Or go modular for the same price with this one:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-power-supply-rs550amaag1s1It's better depending on which games you play.For gaming an i7 is overkill. Your power supply is sufficient, but there are better options for the same price right now: 
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-power-supply-rs550amaag1s1

Go with the BX100 250GB SSD to save $25:

Cheaper RAM with lower (better) CAS rating: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gskill-memory-f31600c10d16gao

Conventional advice around here is the R9 390 over the GTX 970. Their price has kinda evened out though, the 390 is a little better at 1440p+, the 970 generally a little faster at 1080p and below. The 390 requires a 600W minimum PSU, the 970 500W. The R9 290 is basically the same as the 390 with only 4GB of VRAM and is a pretty good deal at the moment compared to either the 390 or 970. http://pcpartpicker.com/part/sapphire-video-card-100362sr or

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-120g10650xr

Also if you're gonna overclock the CPU, get a budget aftermarket cooler: http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-cpu-cooler-rr212e20pkr2. If you're not gonna overclock, don't buy a Z-series mobo and -K CPU.Because it's a 250GB SSD vs a 120GB for the same price, and it's a budget machine where I think space will matter more than an imperceptible performance bump. To save money he could drop down to the 120GB and save $10 if he wanted.

I'm giving him options, if he think's he'll upgrade the PSU in the future then sure, spend the money. If not, he can save $10-15. He's trying to get the price below $600.At 1440p+ yes, but at 1080p it's more like 50-50. Prices have gotten a lot closer lately.If you aren't planning on overclocking, then you don't need to buy the unlocked -K CPU and Z-series motherboard, that's why they cost more. Nor the aftermarket cooler. Save some money and get one of these CPUs instead, they're almost the same if you're not overclocking and a lot cheaper:

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i54590

http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646i54460

Did you get that motherboard for a specific reason? SLI? m.2 slot? SATA Express? If not, switch to this:

If you did, switch to this:
http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-motherboard-z97eYou haven't told us what you use your PC for, but you could switch to a non-overclocking cheaper Intel CPU/motherboard combo and still get better performance than the AMD, then it's only $100 more:

If you're happy with your current performance, keep it until you're no longer happy. Stuff always gets cheaper. But if you do want to upgrade now, the Skylake path seems like the way to go.SteamOS is just a custom Linux build with Steam big picture mode automatically launching on boot. So it has no Windows. You can only play Linux-compatible Steam games on it.

You can play non-steam games on the OS either by streaming them from another PC and adding them as non-steam games or you could install linux games on it probably.

Yes you can stream games from a pc to the shield.I'd strongly advise a higher quality power supply for overclocking. The CX series is for budget builds with no OCs, and may be overloaded or provide unstable overclocks. You don't have to spend much more, but a good power supply is totally worth it.

Everything else looks good.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-20 14:12 EST-0500 |That's a nice quality-of-life upgrade. Won't raise FPS but your computer will just be snappier. 250GB BX100 is a good value, or if you don't need 250GB the 120GB Samsung 850 EVO is faster. Honestly though any SSD is so much faster than a regular hard drive.There's little difference between the two in games. It's just a few more GHz stock with hyperthreading turned on. Plus with an overclock it probably won't bottleneck your *next* GPU.

Caveat: You play GW2 or WoW or Civ V, or other demanding MMOs/Strategy games. They sometimes benefit from an i7.Check out /r/hardwareswap if you haven't already, and yeah, grab a new PSU with one beefy 12V rail or a strong PCIe-only second/third rail.GPU is priority #1 for gaming, get the best that you can afford.

CPU is also important, especially for streaming/recording or MMOs/strategy games. Recommend a quad core, more cores/threads welcome too. Intel wins at the high end, but in your price range AMD is competitive.

Power supply shouldn't be skimped on. You want a high quality unit, not just the maximum amount of wattage. Most EVGA, XFX, Seasonic, Silverstone, Super Flower, Antec models are good. Some Corsairs and Thermaltakes too, but mostly their more expensive ones.

Case can be skimped a little on, but I'd recommend staying above $40.

RAM you just need 8GB for now, get the cheapest you can find but if a faster set is a few $$ more go for it.

Most CPUs already come with coolers, aftermarket ones are only needed for overclocking.

Do you need a monitor/kb/mouse?Either bump the i3 to an i5 (~$50) or spend a bit more on a GPU and get a 4GB R9 380 ($20). Or bump the power supply up to something higher-quality for about $20 more. Actually, I'd advise at least the latter 2, if not all 3.Transfer your OS there (most of them come with a tool to do so, if not free options are available), plus install your most-played games.Well, I'd say that's a fine case, it just lacks a few of the fancier features of more expensive cases.Haha you're very enthusiastic. I got the ROCCAT Savu for like $40 on sale, has similar features, I like it.i5-4460 is the best value i5.That's a great unit, especially for the price. It's all good, they're usually more efficient at 50-60% of capacity anyways. With the CPU OC and 2x OC'd 970s you might be cutting it close though!I'd recommend an IPS panel, but a lot there comes down to budget and your preference for size/resolution. Obviously higher resolution screens need more powerful hardware to keep up the frame rate.Ok, cool. Well, lots of leeway on the power supply so I say go for it.I'd advise you against getting a new motherboard and SLIing. The 2GB of RAM on the 760 will be limiting at high resolutions (like 3 monitors), and when placed in SLI it still acts like 2GB even though between the two cards there's 4GB.

I'd suggest playing on reduced settings until you can save up for a GTX 970 or R9 390.Computer for a family member/friend/poor kid, spares in case something dies, sell them (shoutout to /r/hardwareswap). If they're really old parts, e-waste recycling.Please verify you've hooked up everything correctly by taking a photo with the side of the case off.Are you planning on overclocking? That's an overclocking CPU and an aftermarket cooler for overclocking but a non-overclocking motherboard. You need a Z97 for that.

That's a lot of hard drives.

There might be a better deal on a higher-quality PSU out there but that one isn't bad.

Are you buying from German retailers or one of the local Netherlands shops?Where is it getting stuck? In the back? In the slot? Against something  else on the motherboard?What kind of cable are you using to hook the R9 390 up to the monitor? Any adapters? What video port on the GPU are you using?I haven't read that, so I'm not sure I can answer that question. SLI is "preferable" in the sense that once you've already bought the most expensive GPU out there and you're still not able to max your triple monitors like you want you've gotta go SLI.

In general though, SLI is diminishing returns. If there are good SLI profiles for the game you can almost double your performance, but if you hit the VRAM limit that decreases pretty hard. Sometimes SLI can make sense if two lesser cards cost less than half of a nicer card, or if you already have the nicest card.A quick googling found other people with an R9 290X and R9 260X having a similar problem. I'm suspecting your OEM motherboard has an issue with newer GPUs. Possibly designed to limit warranty issues, or just because.


Either that or it's a bad GPU.You could probably get a cheap socket 1155 motherboard off /r/hardwareswap, I think you may need a microATX size in that case. Might even be able to snag a matching i5/i7.I don't think that's enough of an upgrade from an i3, to be honest. It's more cores, but it's slower cores, so for most games yours is probably faster.

You don't need a brand new board, older ones work, just not OEM ones like yours.Why did you switch from a microATX case? 

You don't need to get a Z170 motherboard if you're not getting an i5-6600K or i7-6700K, Z170s are for overclocking.  The -K at the end of the CPU model means it can be overclocked.

Instead of retyping the list, why not use the reddit export button in PCPartPicker? It formats it with links and everything.

Here's something a little more dialed in. Cheaper RAM in a single stick so that you can upgrade to 16GB later, upgraded to an i5 (twice the number of cores, better for newer games), Cheaper motherboard, a microATX case (same color as the one you chose), cheaper R9 380, a regular hard drive for more games/media:

Probably will only pull 400W peak.On the 2nd build you don't need to buy a Z170, because that CPU can't overclock. An H110/B150/H170 will be sufficient.

On both builds, why such an expensive version of the GTX 980? There's decent versions for over $100 less, like the MSI Twin Frozr. $770 is almost as much as a 980Ti.

I think Build 1 will be faster too, it should beat the other CPU slightly at stock speeds and a lot once overclocked.

Having your desktop/browser on the other window has an impact but it's relatively low.i3 bottlenecking the GTX 970: On some games, yes. On other games, no.

/r/hardwareswap for selling your old GPU.

I wouldn't get a GTX 970 with that power supply though.It'll do. Right now there are some good deals on the R9 380 4GB though, so consider that instead of the GTX 960.How close to the $1500 budget does he want to go? A Xeon E3 might not be a bad choice if he plays MMOs.

The R9 380 4GB is a better deal than the GTX 960 2GB right now.

Could save a little $$ on the motherboard, you don't need the Z97 overclocking features anyways.It's an issue in Windows 10 for some people, yeah. Some people say recent driver updates have helped.Yeah, anything with a x8/x16 PCIe slot, pretty much. So 99% of motherboards from the last 8 years.Eveything looks pretty good, but there are a little higher-quality power supplies out there for a little less money, and that would leave some money for a small SSD. Swapped out motherboard for a cheaper option to come in about $1k:

**Please let us know what your current power supply model is.**

Look into the GTX 960/R9 380/R9 280. R9 380 4GB is a little out of your price range at 215 euro but would be good.

You must not be playing Assassin's Creed/Fallout 4/Far Cry/GTA V/etc. For those you need more GPU beef. Or you have a small monitor res.

I just got around to overclocking my i5-2500k once I got my GTX 970. Running it stable at 4.0GHz with no overvolt for power savings and longevity.Yes, plenty of R9 380s are under 240mm:

http://de.pcpartpicker.com/parts/video-card/#xcx=0&amp;c=310&amp;l=69,240&amp;sort=a8&amp;page=1

That is on German PCPartpicker, but I was able to find some local shops in Austria. Zum beispiel, ab 238mm:

http://www.mylemon.at/artikel/xfx/r9_380p_4df5/r9-380-4096mb-pci-e.html

Whether or not the GTX 960 will be noticably better depends on the games you play. I just upgraded from a 560 Ti to a GTX 970, and I have an i5-2500k. Now I can max BF4 and Far Cry 3 whereas before they were playable on low only, if at all. It helps even if the CPU isn't overclocked.The key to a good gaming tv is low input lag. Do you want 4k or 1080p?

This is a good place to start:

http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-usage/video-gaming/bestI'd say go with this but swap the i7 to the i5 and bump the GTX 960 to a GTX 970 or R9 390.

The GPU upgrade will help on the latest games although I have to say the 680 has held up pretty well and is only a little slower than the GTX 960 on newer titles. A 980Ti will definitely be a good upgrade for high resolution or 144Hz gaming.

Your current CPU is still very competitive. Is it the 3570 or the 3570k? I notice you have the overclocking version of the motherboard.It's not a bad pairing with that CPU, it will be CPU-limited in a few newer games like Fallout 4 but only a little bit.

PSU is cutting it a little close. It'd probably work, seeing as the R9 380 only takes 40W more than your current GPU.All of that stuff is pretty ancient. Hard drive you could keep.Need to know what model power supply you have. That may limit overclocking or which graphics cards you can support.

I'd suggest overclocking the CPU a little bit if you have an aftermarket cooler (if not, buy one), and then buying a new GPU. Look into the GTX 960 or R9 380. Also just noticed you have 4GB of RAM. What is the part # of your current RAM (Use the SPD tab of [CPU-Z](http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) to find out what part #)

And what case do you have? Gotta make sure everything fits.

Even not overclocked, assuming no GPU bottleneck I'd guess your CPU can do about 50fps avg on Ultra or 60fps avg on medium settings. So a small overclock would be nice but you could get by.

Your power supply is of so-so quality, but if you stay well below its rated wattage you're ok. 

Here are two potential upgrades:

Found cheaper, faster RAM.

That case you've selected will not fit that cooler, that's why it wasn't showing up in PCPartPicker for you. Went with a similar case.

Your build has no video card, so I added one.

The MSI model I suggested has exactly the same clocks as the gigabyte, depending on which mode you set it to (Silent/Gaming/OC).That's why you get a small SSD for the OS and programs to make everything load fast, and the regular hard drive for storage of data/other games/media.CPU and GPU really affect games, and both of yours are pretty old. It looks like you can overclock your CPU, which could keep you pretty capable with new games.

Since they advertise the power supply as just "700W power supply", it's probably a piece of shit. I'd recommend you upgrade that and your GPU at the very least.That should be enough, but I don't recommend doing any overclocking with that power supply.It's the length I'd be concerned about in smaller cases. Probably ok though.Wow, some people. Glad to hear it worked out for you, though.It's not a great deal. It'll play older games ok but struggle with the big games from the last few years.

You could do better buy buying a cheap OEM desktop with an Intel i3/i5 CPU and installing a GTX 750Ti.

Or look around here and you'll see plenty of budget builds.
One is the theoretical maximum transfer rate of USB 3.0, the other is the advertisted I/O rates of the hard drive inside the enclosure. Also one is in bytes the other in bits.

They're probably close enoughThere's nothing wrong with ASRock. I've had better luck with them than with ASUS, their parent company.

OP, build looks pretty good. Swapped out the RAM for equivalent but cheaper set, and right now the faster Samsung 850 EVO SSD is cheaper than the BX100 so swapped that in too.
