Not an animator by any means, but I don't think it would be terribly difficult.  These were all done by hand - the background was a static image, then each frame of video was a drawing on transparent film.  They could take a frame from the first film and draw the new character on a new piece of transparent film that was in the same exact position and pose as the character underneath.  

In fact, I might be talking out of my ass here but I thought that some of the original dances were actually done by real actors on film which were used as a sort of motion capture, with the animations drawn over them.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2ORkIrHUbg) is an old video about how early Disney movies were created.  Doesn't touch on live actors being used but it does show how much of a pain in the ass it was to create a fluid looking video, so it makes sense that they'd re-use animation sequences that were proven to look good.Hi `Jono46k`.

Instead they're going to grow up being told (and believing) their parents 'saved them' from being around a trans person.  They've essentially just been set on their own path to bigotry and intolerance.FYI - I am working on just such a thing, so hopefully this will help with the 'incorrect title' removals.  Right now the only way to verify is to google the title you gave the post, and hopefully the first google result is the article you posted - but even then it's not always foolproof.   What compounds the problem is that depending on when the link was posted and how many moderators are around, we may not get to review the article until some hours have passed, giving the original source more time to change their headline.

I'm writing a utility that will capture the article exactly as written at the time it was posted (or within minutes, at least) that the mods can then reference to check for a changed headline.

And as L_Cranston_Shadow says, better to just leave the post and let us approve if it was mistakenly taken down.I was there on Sunday when they serve food - the soup is fantastic.

If you have any questions about this removal, please feel free to [message the moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/politics&amp;subject=Question regarding the removal of this submission by /u/combuchan&amp;message=I have a question regarding the removal of this [submission.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3nhrit/civil_rights_champion_representative_don_edwards/\))Either title?  The title of the article is "Former Democratic South Bay Rep. Don Edwards dies at 100".  That does not match the title you gave it, nor does your title exist within the article itself.&gt; Nobody would know what made Don Edwards famous by that article title.

And that's the problem - you decided to add 'Civil rights champion'.  The author of the article didn't even call him that. Adding the 'D-CA' to help identify him would have been good enough.  

From our wiki:

&gt; Submissions should have titles comprised of a quote copied and pasted from the article. Do not add, remove words or change words. At the same time, users should be able to focus on what they believe to be the most important parts of an article. To facilitate that, we allow the following slight edits of quotes that don't change their meaning, but make more material useful in the context of titles providing good information on an article's content:

&gt;Users may replace pronouns with the appropriate correct names (example: "He told them" becomes "Obama told the Senate )
Users may use the full names of organizations or people ("Supreme court" becomes ""Missouri Supreme court" or "NSA" becomes "National Security Agency" or "Obama" becomes "President Barack Obama" )
Users may specify the state of a bill ("A bill to" becomes "A Californian bill to")
Quotes may be attributed to their speaker by name (e.g. instead of submitting a plain quote, users may add "Speaker Name:" to the front of the quote or "- [Speaker Name]" to the end of the quote).


...and finally:
&gt;The most objective way for the moderation team to avoid inserting political bias into how submissions are handled is not to give exceptions and make judgement calls on whether slight changes are "okay" or not. We therefore enforce the title rules consistently even if that means removing articles for minor title changes.Hi `simoncarr`. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.

And holy shit - was googling images for an example and a completely buried childhood memory just surfaced.  I didn't remember having one until I saw [this](http://lespetitesgourmettes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/console.png).  We had that exact same one, I'm pretty sure.  I remember playing with the little door handle and the speaker grill.  Woah.This seems to be a common theme for restaurants that get featured on TV - Restaurant Impossible, Diner's Drive-Inns and Dives, etc.  They get featured, the food looks good, they get tons of new business, they think they've finally 'made it', they either expand, open another location, raise food prices and/or let service quality suffer, and as time goes on and the yelp reviews pile up, they wonder why they're not doing business like they were and end up shutting down.Hi `deletemybrain`.

Seems pretty straightforward.  There's nothing here about challenges to, changes to or questioning of federal agency policy.  Should every article about someone facing criminal charges be considered political in nature?I certainly see your point, but the guidelines for this subreddit have been well established and it's not up to me to decide, nor can I unilaterally decide to let yours through while trying to justify to the next person why their article offering a historical perspective of (current political hot topic) has been removed. (And believe me, people DO search back through years of posts trying to find instances of exactly that when their posts are removed.)

Our previous guy was $80, and an estimate from a new guy was also for $80. That's not just for cutting the grass - it's cutting the entire yard, trimming/edging along the edges of the yard, edging the driveway and street front, trimming trees/bushes, pulling weeds, and spraying roundup. (every week in the summer, every other week in the winter).  Since we've had a lawn service the only yard work we've ever had to do was planting new things and laying down some mulch that needed to be replaced.  I loathe pulling weeds, and am not fond of mowing the yard (especially weekly in the summer, where skipping a week means mowing down a jungle the following week) so if you can afford it, it's certainly worth it.

We did get a flyer dropped in the driveway that said they'd do it for 40 bucks a month, but that's likely a shoddy job where they just come and mow the yard and nothing else, which might be a good compromise if you don't care about having to pull weeds every so often.)Tell that to my wife.

^*Heyo!*Yep, another vote for Brighthouse here.  They have different tiers of speeds.  I have the middle tier which I think is supposed to be 60mbps but I actually get close to 80.

Damn.  I mean, the guy's a dick for shoving and punching someone, but does that seem a little harsh to anyone else?  Maybe because it was race-related/hate crime?

Edit: Downvote away, I thought this was an isolated incident and didn't see the part where the guy had a history of domestic abuse.Ah, totally missed that.  Yeah makes more sense now.Yep someone else pointed that out and I didn't see that part of the article.  Yeah punishment seems much more reasonable now.Damn.

I don't recall when I transitioned, but thicker liquids (yogurt, creamy soups) was the next step, then pureed foods like mashed potatoes.

I think you'll find that lots of things that you were previously ok with will now give you problems - even after you're fully healed.  You'll kind of have to figure that out as you go.  I do recall attempting to eat some clam chowder (which I normally love) on the 'pureed foods' phase and it was absolutely revolting. I'm coming up on my 5th year anniversary and I still have issues with pork and beef (especially leftover/reheated/microwaved for some reason).Well, FIT does have a school/college of aeronautics. :)Yes.

I used to use the same password everywhere, so I then started to use that password and add to it some unique info based on the website itself.  Like the *Nth* letter from the site name, or the first and last letters of the site name but reversed, the number of characters in the site name, and so on.

The only time this fails is for the few sites that requires a new password every X months, which I think I only have one site that does that to me every 3 months, and I probably log in to that site twice a year so I just use 'forgot password' each time.Oh shit never seen this before.  Thanks for the laugh.Back in '95 when I started going to raves my mom asked me if I was taking that 'Fantasy' drug.  "Never heard of it, mom".

If you have too many disconnected accounts on your clock as a customer rep, or not enough upgrades, you probably get penalized in some way (or perhaps you won't get that $25 gift card to Applebee's at the end of the month if you don't have enough upsells).  I know a call center manager who worked at Brighthouse (previously Time Warner, soon to be Charter) and that shit wouldn't fly.  There's always notes on everyone's account with what you discussed, and all calls were recorded and retained for a certain amount of time and could always be pulled up and reviewed.  If you were found to falsifying information like that you'd be out on your ass.

I can only imagine a company as large as Comcast has to have similar technologies in place, so if the front line phone reps can get away with that shit (hanging up on you if you want to disconnect, signing you up for things you never even talked about) then it either means no one in management gives a shit what you do as an employee or it means this kind of activity is actively encouraged.  (After all, the call center managers are probably under the same kind of pressure from above to get their collective numbers up just as much as the phone reps are. Gotta get that $50 Applebees gift card at the end of the month!)Hi `macadore`. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.

I'd be interested in any kind of 'food-bearing' plants.Same here.  I'm 38, so grew up solidly in the 80s.  It's more nostalgia for me.  We turned on the Great Pumpkin when it was on this year, but didn't "gather round the TV" to watch it.  It was more like 'comforting background noise with familiar sounds'.  And I don't even have kids.  I'll likely do the same for the Christmas specials, although we don't necessarily seek it out.  It's just part of the holiday season just like any other classic Christmas movie.Those trees in the background are long gone - that's where Islands of Adventure is now.  The building is now the Blue Man Group venue.I think calling it 'random' is a more recent phenomenon, but it's stuff kids at that age have always done.  Just basically trying to be silly or attention seeking by doing something weird, quirky, unexpected.  I think.  I have no kids nor have I been near that age group in two decades.I went somewhere around 89-91 and vaguely remember taking the tour.  You basically walked as a group into areas of the building - parts were simply for show (I vaguely remember a 'goo lab' or something silly like that) and some were studio sets that were set up for some of their shows (unless those were reproductions but I don't think so).  They'd choose a few people out of the audience to go down on the set and get slimed.Hey, cool. I have a gallon jug of elmer's and almost a full box of borax out in the garage.  I know what I'm doing this weekend.  ^^(Procrastinating, ^again.)Oh, I never got pine trees. I had that bad ass [CGI wireframe grid (not me btw)](http://9.media.tumblr.com/tbXsyOG5Tk1jaaq6MdQSAexKo1_500.jpg).It's not widespread, at least not in my experience.  It's like people who say "irregardless" or "nucular" (instead of 'nuclear').  Not widespread but there's people out there who do say it.Hi `BlankVerse`. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.

If you have too many disconnected accounts on your clock as a customer rep, or not enough upgrades, you probably get penalized in some way (or perhaps you won't get that $25 gift card to Applebee's at the end of the month if you don't have enough upsells).  I know a call center manager who worked at Brighthouse (previously Time Warner, soon to be Charter) and that shit wouldn't fly.  There's always notes on everyone's account with what you discussed, and all calls were recorded and retained for a certain amount of time and could always be pulled up and reviewed.  If you were found to falsifying information like that you'd be out on your ass.

I can only imagine a company as large as Comcast has to have similar technologies in place, so if the front line phone reps can get away with that shit (hanging up on you if you want to disconnect, signing you up for things you never even talked about) then it either means no one in management gives a shit what you do as an employee or it means this kind of activity is actively encouraged.  (After all, the call center managers are probably under the same kind of pressure from above to get their collective numbers up just as much as the phone reps are. Gotta get that $50 Applebees gift card at the end of the month!)Hi `macadore`. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.

I'd be interested in any kind of 'food-bearing' plants.Same here.  I'm 38, so grew up solidly in the 80s.  It's more nostalgia for me.  We turned on the Great Pumpkin when it was on this year, but didn't "gather round the TV" to watch it.  It was more like 'comforting background noise with familiar sounds'.  And I don't even have kids.  I'll likely do the same for the Christmas specials, although we don't necessarily seek it out.  It's just part of the holiday season just like any other classic Christmas movie.Those trees in the background are long gone - that's where Islands of Adventure is now.  The building is now the Blue Man Group venue.I think calling it 'random' is a more recent phenomenon, but it's stuff kids at that age have always done.  Just basically trying to be silly or attention seeking by doing something weird, quirky, unexpected.  I think.  I have no kids nor have I been near that age group in two decades.I went somewhere around 89-91 and vaguely remember taking the tour.  You basically walked as a group into areas of the building - parts were simply for show (I vaguely remember a 'goo lab' or something silly like that) and some were studio sets that were set up for some of their shows (unless those were reproductions but I don't think so).  They'd choose a few people out of the audience to go down on the set and get slimed.Hey, cool. I have a gallon jug of elmer's and almost a full box of borax out in the garage.  I know what I'm doing this weekend.  ^^(Procrastinating, ^again.)Oh, I never got pine trees. I had that bad ass [CGI wireframe grid (not me btw)](http://9.media.tumblr.com/tbXsyOG5Tk1jaaq6MdQSAexKo1_500.jpg).It's not widespread, at least not in my experience.  It's like people who say "irregardless" or "nucular" (instead of 'nuclear').  Not widespread but there's people out there who do say it.Hi `BlankVerse`. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.

I made a pot roast over the past weekend in my crock pot - a 3.5 pound piece of meat, carrots, potatoes, onions and seasonings, and the recipe only called for a cup of broth.  The liquid did not initially cover all the ingredients.  8 hours on low and by about halfway the water level had risen to cover everything.Worth also mentioning for those who don't know:  Pressure Fryer != Pressure Cooker.  Do not try frying food via pressure in a normal pressure cooker or you're Gonna Have A Bad Time.non chicken crap?

I think Riviera is where all the WPB 'help' lives.I have IE11 but put the browser in IE9 browser emulation and IE9 user agent string, loaded up the site and I'm not finding anything that is unclickable.  I clicked on one of the links in the header (over ons) and then a couple links on that page.  

Can you give us a specific link that isn't clickable?  One thought - I notice that sometimes there's a popup/interstitial that you're putting over the main page when it first loads.  Are you sure that that div is actually disappearing?  If "no link is clickable" that means to me there's either something invisible (link a transparent div) that's covering the link, or you're doing something in javascript/jquery that is preventing a link from acting naturally (like .preventDefault())Hi `green_euphoria`.

And you would've been met with "Ok, old man \**rolls eyes**".  Kids tend to think that bad things are what happens to other people.  This kid probably thinks he's a perfect fine driver, it's all those other slow people driving around that are the problem.Wow, that's a shame.  I lived there twice:  In the mid 90s (moved there with parents when I was in highschool) and again around 2001 when I was living on my own.  Back then it was called Grenada Bay.  Both times were in those end units with no apartment above.  It was pretty nice at both points in time.  The only thing I remember was that there were lots of feral cats.  I do recall driving past there at some point after a hurricane and then entire complex was completely flooded.  Every ground floor had to have had standing water in it.  I certainly don't remember much crime in there.Hi `SSR1234`. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.

Prior to this, there were lots of things that left us scratching our heads or upset us at the time, but most people gave them the benefit of the doubt (multiple times). 

I started playing after I picked up the game during last year's Summer Steam Sale.  Loved it.  Big Bank had just come out.  Towards the end of summer, they put up this mysterious page with a countdown on it, with something like 30 days.  It was nothing but a picture/video of a wall with shadows on it and a radio playing in the background.  Each day the radio played something different, but what was playing gave no clues.  People were analyzing the waveforms, looking for some meta-game that didn't exist.  'Day 0' coincided with either Overkill's birthday or the Payday 2 release anniversary, I can't recall.  There was lots of hype leading to the buildup and it was very much implied that this had something to do with PD2.  Day 0 comes and it's announcement that they're creating The Walking Dead game.  PD2 users got an in game item, quickly renamed 'The Disappointment Bat'.  The community felt a bit used by this - hyping up a new game for the company when we thought it was something specifically about PD2.

Months later, the first Crimefest is announced, similar to the one we just had - free content, new stuff.  We had to do certain activities to 'unlock' the free content.  Some days were flops (yay new masks), others were good (yay new maps or weapons). The concept of perk decks was introduced.  We got the John Wick character, nicely tied in with the movie release.  You could get PD2 for free if you bought a ticket to the movie. (Would they really *not* have released John Wick if we hadn't met the goals to unlock this day? I think not.) The event ended with the much-anticipated Hoxton Breakout.  Some people had issues with the event, but overall it was well received.

In December, a new way to extract more money from our wallets was released: the 'character + map DLC' concept.  We were introduced to Clover in conjunction with the Diamond Heist.  You could buy Clover (and associated perk deck) and separately buy the Diamond Heist.

In January of 2015, we again see the same thing with Dragan and The Butcher/Bomb Heists.  Dragan (with new perk deck) and The Bomb maps being sold separately.  (Having bought all DLC at this point, I'm starting to feel like they're getting a bit greedy - the rate of DLC releases seems to be increasing.)

Now in February, the HypeTrain event is announced.  Much like Crimefest - free content promised if you can 'unlock' them - but *this* time, we can't unlock the days by simply doing things in the game.  No, we have to generate 'hype fuel', which can only be done by buying PD2 content!  This event was billed as a way to help support Overkill so they could continue to create new content for the game.  They announced the Completely Overkill Pack, DLC which costs $20, limited to 50,000 purchases and gave you 4 glowing masks plus one super-secret item that would be announced at a later date.  Then the regular Overkill Pack which costs $5.  Jacket was announced as a tie-in with Hotline Miami (buying Hotline Miami generated hype fuel as well - and this is the only way you could access Jacket and his perk deck).  The game went on sale, as did much of the DLC, in order to increase sales/hypefuel.  The unlocked items would become available during the upcoming Spring Break event.  This event gave us things like the SWAT van turret, Side Jobs, the Car Shop heist, a preview of the Golden Grin, Bonnie, the Hoxton Revenge map, and Paydaycon.  This rattled a few people since we'd just bankrolled their desire to have a convention and a $250,000 payout for a silly tournament.  Something most of us couldn't possibly care less about.

So, Spring Break rolls around and the content is unlocked, once each day.  One of them is a tie-in with Speedrunners - buy Speedrunners and you get special masks unlocked.

Other things have happened that I don't want to look up timelines.  Infamy used to go to level 5. For the longest time, "V-100" was as far as you could go.  For a long time they promised "Infamy 2.0" which was supposed to be something great.  It fell flat.  They just added 20 more levels, and a mask or XP boost for each level.  Lots of people were upset about this.  To appease the masses, OVK/Almir eventually apologized and said they would look at ways to improve this (still waiting on that).

During one of the earlier events we were promised FBI Files and a new enemy (which would eventually become Captain Winters) - these were a long time coming, meanwhile plenty of other content (DLC) was released.

I'm probably forgetting a few other things but this post is already way longer than I meant it to be, so I'll end it here.  In short, it's been building for a long time, and the general feel for close to a year now is that OVK is trying to bleed our wallets as much as they can, and given how much we've already supported them with our wallets, introducing microtransactions is just the final kick in the balls we needed to end the relationship.  And for those of us who bought the Completely Overkill Pack, that 'special item' ended up being a free drill to open a crate.  My special reward was a 'well-worn' skin for a gun I never use.

So for me, the feeling has been building for a while, but this latest brouhaha is what finally killed off any love I still had for the game."MRW I'm Javert"Wow.  How odd that they'd use that in a commercial.  I've seen this video many times (usually when the subject of what English sounds like) but it's still a pretty obscure video.

It has its place, good on a burger, too.  but you won't find it on the table at any fine dining restaurant/steakhouse. if ypu've had HP sauce it's very similar. I can't be too much help, but I can say I began playing with Tropico 3 and loved it.  I don't think I missed out on anything by not playing the prior versions.  Tropico 4 is essentially more of Tropico 3 with some slight improvements, new buildings, and so on. If/when you get Tropico 4, also get the 'Modern Times' DLC.  That's a huge add on which practically doubles the play time (more new buildings and a whole new campaign).

Tropico has been one of those games I'll play a little bit of for a few days and then not play for a long time - so I haven't finished Modern Times, and because of that, I've not played Tropico 5 yet, even though it's been in my library for close to a year now.  As for Tropico 5, I've heard it's slightly different and I've heard mixed reviews about it.

However if you say you already own versions 1-3, why not start with version 1?  "I'm just playing the same game you are."  Exactly.  What a dick.I had no idea Uber was available here either.  I've never used it but I've heard it talked about quite a bit.  Everything is done through the app.  You request a ride, the closest driver is dispatched to you.  It's apparently much faster than a taxi. You also pay through the app, so you're not exchanging money with the driver.  Uber has a requirement of their vehicles - something like it can't be more than 3 years old or something, so the car will be in a good condition.  When you're done with the ride, you can rate the driver and they can rate you.  Drivers who drop below a certain star rating will be 'dismissed' from Uber.  Likewise, 'bad passengers' can be banned (or maybe drivers can opt out of picking you up if you have a low rating).  So if you are belligerent, puke in someone's back seat, light up a cigarette and burn a hole in their seat, etc.., you'll find that it will be difficult to use Uber in the future.  I've heard most drivers are very accommodating - they'll either chat with you or leave you alone, change the radio for you, some drivers have bottled water or sodas, charging cords for phones, etc. Maybe the Front Street Civic Center?  They have a large room and small room - the small room holds up to 90 people and is $300 (plus a $150 deposit, though).

I went out to Red Rocks a couple of times.  It's cool to see, but one time I had a few hours to blow while waiting for someone and I drove out to Valley of Fire.  That place is incredible. When I went it was practically empty - I only passed a few cars.  I think it's the only place I've ever been and not heard a single thing.  It was actually a bit eerie.  No wind, no bugs chirping, just dead silence. There's a lot more to see/do there, too.  With Red Rocks you just kind of drive around and look at the cliffs (and climbing if you're a climber, but many are not).  At VoF there's hieroglyphics and different formations you can stop and get out and look at.50 years old!  [Now you can shimmy, stretch and *kick*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9-K_AG2S8U)Yeah I used to never watch Ina because it felt boring.  Then I started reading the short episode blurbs of what she was going to be making and thought "damn, that sounds good", so started watching it.  I've made lots of good things based on her recipes now.  She's kind of like the nice lady across the street who makes awesome food.  Not terribly entertaining, but you want to eat whatever she makes.

I do like it when she sends her whipped husband Jeffrey off on some shopping trip, and have to laugh when she pops in to her gourmet grocery to get some off-the-wall ingredient you'd only find in Paris or The Hamptons where she lives.Hi `plumbobber`.

Yeah makes more sense now.Yep someone else pointed that out and I didn't see that part of the article.  Yeah punishment seems much more reasonable now.Damn.

If you're supposed to report tomorrow, there should be a number you need to call this evening after 6pm (I think).  You enter your ID and it will tell you if you need to report.  I've been told that many times if your report date is on a Friday you have a good chance of being dismissed. I can't recall the specific reason but it may have to do with lawyers/judges not wanting to start a trial on a Friday or something like that.

If you *are* selected and need to show up, bring some non-electronic backup.  I think you can use your phone while waiting to be called but at some point you may need to turn off/put away all electronics so you'll want a book or something to occupy your time for a good while (I'd say magazine but you may end up reading that magazine 5 times over).  Be sure not to bring anything that could be consTrued as a weapon inside.  Swiss army knife, mace, etc.  Essentially act like you're getting on a flight at the airport because your bags will go through an xray machine and you'll need to empty your pockets and go through a metal detector.Hi `just_a_normal_cat`.

Considering the fact that the CO Pack was marketed as a 'one time only' thing, and many people feared they might regret not buying it, I'd rather they go with this option.  It should be a reward for people who threw $20 at Overkill just to help support them.  To hell with the people who didn't buy it.Well, I could be wrong, since someone mentioned that they have free wi-fi.  So I'm guessing for at least some portions of the day you're able to use your electronics.

Since the title on the youtube page isn't helpful, another option is to use a quote from the video - but you must include the timestamp of when the quote occurs so we can verify it.  Example:

What you can do is replace he/she with the person to give it better context.If you're trying to convey that it's Obama talking about Carson, you could use the article title plus a quote:

&gt; President Obama on Free Speech on Campus - 9/14/2015 "I have no idea what that means.  And I suspect he (Ben Carson) doesn't either." [00:37]


...or something like that.  That might not be the best title choice either as it still doesn't give much context to the quote.  Sometimes our rules don't play nicely with some of the submitted articles or videos, and yours seems to be one of those cases unfortunately.  If you can find an article that discusses this particular speech or question it may be easier to pass our criteria.Because I'm a mod in this subreddit and I was able to see his post, which was removed.  I approved it which allowed everyone else to see it.

The point of a shadowban is to hide their activity from view without tipping them off that their content isn't actually being seen by anyone (and thus they don't automatically create a new account to circumvent the ban).   Apparently he did something at some point that made it look he was a spammer so the system or an admin shadowbanned him.Hi `keenly_disinterested`. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.

I also see that there are political connotations to this article.  But the rules that have been crafted for /r/politics specifically forbid  this type of article.  Believe me, with as polarized as US politics is, and by extension major media outlets, we see a LOT of posts that are not about politics but rather one media outlet critiquing other media outlets all the time.  "Why Anderson Cooper was wrong" or "Why Bill O'Reilly makes sense".  Like I said - I didn't remove your post, but I'm sure that was the reasoning that led to your post's removal.  It was more about Reddit being popular with Bernie supporters than it was about Bernie's campaign itself.&gt;  I don't see what there is in PD2 to compete in.

That was some of the criticism that came out when it was released.  It's not a competitive game, much of it is based on RNG, how do you even have a competition and objectively choose a winner?Well said.  They've tainted their brand.  I *was* looking forward to future Overkill titles like TWD and a PD3 if it ever is made.  Now, not so much.  Translation:  I was not prepared for this topic to come up and can't pull shit out of my ass without talking to the rest of the team about it first."We need to build more tollbooths on this road to pay for the tollbooths we just built!"Don't forget the deluge of content provided via the Lion Game Lion relationship.Hi `EMPEROR_TRUMP_2016`.
