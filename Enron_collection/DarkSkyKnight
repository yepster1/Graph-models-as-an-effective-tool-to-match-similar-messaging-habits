Yeah, the bracketed phrase is unnecessary for the title, but are you seriously asking what Jack Ma copied from American companies?&gt; and he didnt have to do anything or give anything up to get it

See, this is not logical. Just because he didn't deserve the treatment does not mean not giving him the treatment is the optimal choice.

Americans are denouncing China's human rights issues because of their emotions and morality, which Xi direly lacks, but that doesn't mean on the geopolitical level we should do the same thing. Every denouncement made by the Leader of the Free World needs to be calculated and precise, not what the blabbering loudmouth Hillary Clinton is doing.Joshua Wong is not only naive, but also hopeless. Good as an idealistic leader but I doubt he could achieve much.

Some say the Umbrella protests were a great event, but it achieved nothing if not a negative outcome, which is the tightening of protest rights in HK.&gt; that Chinese students in his class did seem to have a tendency to self-censor

Eventually the Chinese government will need less and less active censorship; people will shut up themselves, and will be eager to report people who misconduct to the authorities... oh dear.I don't see how getting rich off stealing IPs relates to economic concerns of China.

What he said makes sense, but he fails to realize that not everyone has the same mindset as him. The youth is increasingly living by the day and not utilize savings so an economic setback could hit them hard.

Lavish lifestyles typically accompany bad saving habits, so it won't be a surprise that in an economic setback, domestic consumption will be driven low.Osborne bows to everyone but the people.The US economy, for one, is looking stable right now.&gt; enema party

I've never asked that and I doubt they kill people. I did hang out with tech entrepreneurs during an intern, and well, avoiding taxes and such are considered normal practice so no one really thinks much about it.http://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-change-the-fonts-on-your-android-phone-32078/Calm down.

There is deception and there is tax evasion and bullshitting projects that hold no water, but if you're seriously suggesting every successful person in China murders and rapes I don't know what to say.

As I've said, bribery, tax evasion etc. are seen so normal that a lot of people don't see them as serious crimes. For example, giving them a discount on a mansion in return for less restrictions is seen as a "bro" thing to do, not a crime.

Reality is much less boring than you think.No one is suggesting they are clean wtf? Give me one evidence that rich families killing and murdering is a typical occurence and I'll be convinced.

&gt; probably committed all sorts of crimes including murder

This is the most ridiculous point I've heard. I cannot seriously entertain the idea that murder is widespread among rich people in China. Maybe you will find people who agree with you in /r/conspiracy.Not everyone is a PC master raceYou're using *Epoch Times*, of all sources.

I'm not going to continue this discussion. I'd rather believe people I know IRL for several years than a stranger on the Internet.

Furthermore, one case does not show *widespread* murder, which is what you're suggesting, if it's even True.All right, Epoch Times contributor.Ah, the pun.When Japanese publishers revised textbook depictions of World War II at the government\u2019s behest this spring, China was quick to cry foul. And with good reason: The new high-school history books toned down or ignored atrocities like the Nanjing Massacre and Japanese soldiers\u2019 use of Chinese and Korean \u201ccomfort women\u201d as sex slaves.

One Xinhua editorial bluntly condemned Tokyo\u2019s revisionism. \u201cMaybe the Abe administration could start to show its sincerity in \u2018deep remorse\u2019 by stopping playing up school textbook [sic] as a tool to stay in power, and passing on correct historical perceptions, instead of lies, to the young generation,\u201d the state-run news agency wrote.

But Beijing can\u2019t claim the moral high ground on this issue. It is guilty of the same offense.

One of China\u2019s most popular high-school history textbooks published by state-run People\u2019s Education Press similarly whitewashes history. It emphasizes incidents when China was bullied by foreign powers and plays down the mistakes of its own leaders. The textbook is part of a larger patriotic-education campaign started in the 1990s that led to an upsurge in nationalism.

Within the three books covering the required history curriculum, the global context of World War II is neglected. Instead a single chapter covers the War of Japanese Resistance, the period from 1931 to 1945 during which Chinese fought against Japanese invasion. (A supplementary textbook for an elective history course summarizes the global conflict.)

\u201cEverywhere the Japanese invaders went,\u201d the text reads, \u201cthey wantonly slaughtered, pillaged and burned, committing evil to no end.\u201d The book reminds students that Japanese soldiers murdered women and children, despite having wives and children of their own. It asks, \u201cWhat caused the Japanese invaders to change from people into inhuman beasts?\u201d Yet nowhere does the required curriculum educate students on the preceding decades of Japanese history or culture, information needed to reach a nuanced response to that question.

The textbook also errs on the side of nationalism in passages regarding Hong Kong. \u201c[The city] finally returned to the great embrace of the motherland,\u201d one chapter reads, describing Great Britain\u2019s 1997 handover. \u201cThe Chinese people had finally wiped out the hundred years of national humiliation caused by Hong Kong\u2019s occupation.\u201d

Yet Hong Kong\u2019s history is hardly so simple. The People\u2019s Republic under Mao Zedong accepted British rule in the colony and used it as a window to the outside world. Deng Xiaoping invited Hong Kong businesses to invest on the mainland to kick-start his reform and opening program.

Meanwhile, explanations of less successful policies of the Chinese Communist Party are couched in dry analysis. The textbook ignores the estimated 10 million to 40 million famine deaths caused by the Great Leap Forward. Instead it focuses on how the failed midcentury industrialization policy \u201cviolated the objective laws of economics and overstepped phases of historical development.\u201d

The Cultural Revolution is treated somewhat more openly\u2014the textbook acknowledges that a general state of violence and chaos shook society. Yet it bills the movement as a momentary lapse in Mao\u2019s socialist instincts, aggravated by his power-hungry wife\u2019s opportunism. The reputation of the party\u2019s founding father emerges largely intact.

Overall the textbooks tend to play up past instances of Chinese victimization while sanitizing 65 years of communist rule. That is the result of a policy begun under Party Secretary Jiang Zemin in the mid-1990s. As scholars like Seton Hall University\u2019s Zheng Wang have written, current Chinese-history curricula are part of a deliberate policy to stoke nationalism in order to maintain the Party\u2019s legitimacy.

According to Prof. Wang\u2019s research, after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests demonstrated a loss of faith in the Party, the government decided to adjust citizens\u2019 understanding of their own country. A 1994 Party document detailing the \u201cPatriotic Education Campaign\u201d included the following directive: \u201cWe must turn patriotic thought into the underlying melody of society and create a rich atmosphere of patriotism. We must make it so that throughout all aspects of daily life\u2014wherever, whenever\u2014people will be subjected to patriotic thought, feeling and influence.\u201d History education was one of the first targets of the campaign.

But now the Party\u2019s version of history is heading in an alarming direction. As Prof. Wang notes in his 2012 book, \u201cNever Forget National Humiliation,\u201d \u201cThere is actually a feedback loop in today\u2019s China whereby the nationalistic history education stimulates the rise of nationalism, and the rise of nationalism provides a bigger market for nationalistic messages.\u201d

This spike in nationalism corresponds with a swell in animosity toward perceived enemies, especially Japan. Last year a joint poll by Tokyo think tank Genron NPO and Chinese newspaper China Daily found that 86.8% of Chinese viewed Japan negatively, compared with 36.5% in 2007. Furthermore, 53.4% of Chinese thought there would be military conflict with Japan in the future.

Beijing says that it respects other countries\u2019 sovereignty and will never become a hegemon in Asia. Yet its Patriotic Education Campaign has stoked antiforeign sentiment that might be exploited in future by an expansionist government. If East Asia is to have lasting peace, China\u2019s leaders would do well to broaden citizens\u2019 remembrance of the past.NFC has potential and is incredibly versatile.

No matter how many times I say this in HK people always get upset and think they could still make a change. HK is a part of China now and there's not quite much anyone could do about it, no matter how inconvenient this truth is.Not really. If possible, they would request a phone number without '4', for example, but they wouldn't freak out and kill 5 students if there are 44 students in a class.

We must unwaveringly reform with Chinese characteristics and desist foreign influences just as Scandinavian countries have opened their path with Scandinavian characteristics without foreign interference. The middle class will achieve prosperity and the cultural exchange will bring the two nations to higher heights.This is True; I overlooked this fact.Chinese peasants (literally) use harmful chemicals, like melamine, because they don't know better, or they don't think it will cause serious damage to the body due to a "whatever" attitude. Once again, education is key, and there needs to be programs aimed at teaching peasants what are harmful chemicals and what are not, and the corresponding laws. Just making new laws isn't going to help.LOL\&gt; kaya is terrible

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I'm waiting for the "Bravo on China for eliminating Islam" comment.Before someone jumps to the conclusion that "they are afraid they lose face due to the Pope overshadowing Xi", that is frankly not True, since the media can control it however the want to emphasize Xi's visit over the Pope's. It is because China doesn't officially recognize the Vatican, and they are scared any coverage of what the Pope says is going to affect people's ideologies. The Pope's speech was frankly touching, but if people in China hears it and takes it to heart, I doubt the ruling elite would like that.&gt; The practice, though, is still deeply ingrained. Cue the national shock in China in May when Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, emerged mere hours after giving birth to pose for the paparazzi with her newborn daughter. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Duchess Kate do confinement?\u201d asked a user on the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo.

It was a problem because a lot of suppliers did the same thing. That's why you see aftershocks after the scandal in the top milk brands.

Here, relevant quote:

&gt; Thus, farmers either added melamine contaminant unwittingly, or turned a blind eye to milk adulteration to ensure their milk was not rejected

Farmers added it themselves, and the milk companies didn't bother to do quality check.Keep downvoting away when I'm not even disagreeing with you. You are a racist and bigoted asshole and downvote just because you think I'm from China. I posted this just to see what response I'll get, and sure enough, I got what I expected.

In fact, you would downvote anything that is not anti-China - even neutral facts. If I were to say China has the second largest GDP, I bet you would downvote that as well, and launch an all-out offensive on nothing in particular.

It is alarming how there are people like you who can't see that a person can hold an array of views that aren't black and white, but no, you pollute this sub with the most vehement black-and-white ideology, imposed on people who hold neutral or varied views on China.

Go on, be an absolute idealist and downvote all my posts, because I'm the devil for thinking that China is censoring the Pope because of other reasons than being scared of losing face! I bet you think anyone who has ever thought that China has the second largest GDP is a wumao.http://puu.sh/kvaoA.png

Not to mention that, within HK, the anti-protest views are not in the minority.

Do you even read my comments?+/u/trollabot /u/DarkSkyKnightAh, all the girls like those beta boys, manYeah, I understand the point of the protests, but because HK is now a part of China, I doubt Beijing would keep their end of the bargain. Protesting is not going to change that fact.You could either make an attempt at a coherent counterargument to my point, or I'll just treat your comment as a meaningless personal attack.beta-flaccidSorry about thatI seriously doubt that because, as you have said, the protests were disorganized. The problem is that different people are really protesting for different reasons, and they don't really have a unified goal. The political climate in Hong Kong is not only divisive, but also far from black and white, with a huge amount of different pro-democracy parties with different goals and different orientation. If they were to join forces the leadership question will be hard to resolve.

Even if they are successful, Beijing will not budge because they control Hong Kong's water and possess an army capable of crushing HK. Furthermore Beijing could grant a False universal suffrage system while they spam propaganda in HK's media and commit vote fraud. There is no way China is going to let an anti-China politician make things irritating for Beijing, especially when it is so easy to simply ignore the protests and let it fizzle out by itself.

I am of the opinion that change needs to come from a revolution within China, and yeah I'm pessimistic that it would happen anytime soon.I know :(Do you know it???I have nothing against Chinese people.

I have something against racist and sexist Chinese people. I don't even care if you're nationalistic. But [entertaining the idea of opening up Unit 731s across China to exterminate white people](http://archive.is/m14S2) is sickening.

Not to mention the fact that you aren't even a True Chinese, as I've uncovered a while ago on r/am.You said yourself that your Chinese is bad.

How long have you lived in China? Can you communicate with Chinese people at a colloquial level? Are you able to understand \u6587\u8a00\u6587? Are you able to give an overview of different dynasties of China? Do you understand Chinese youth culture? Are you able to see how historical factors in ancient Chinese society reflect on modern society? Can you read \u9c81\u8fc5's texts in Chinese? Are you able to understand the jokes today's Chinese make? Do you understand traditional family values in ancient, modern, and contemporary Chinese culture? Can you see the difference between Confucianism and Neoconfucianism? Can you distinguish the effects of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism on today's Chinese society?http://puu.sh/kvq4c.png

That lamb pizza looks deliciousWere Gandhi to exist 50 years earlier he wouldn't have succeeded. It was in the British Empire's interests to let India gain independence after half a century of a strong desire for independence across the whole nation. The same situation does not exist in HK:

There is a lack of *universal* strong desire for universal suffrage, due to the high volume of patriotic HKers and immigrants.

No foreign government will interfere as long as China doesn't drive tanks into HK.

China is not weakened through wars.

China controls significant resources critical to HK's survival.

I'm not optimistic that HK can do anything about it. I don't mind people protesting, but since I'm an asshole, I point out that it is very likely not going to do anything.I attended high school in HK, and at least 30% of the girls liked the beta boysActually violence is the plausible option to enforce a change, not that I support it.To change the Beijing government is an arduous and almost impossible task at the moment. Hong Kong is deteriorating in its freedom and that's a direct effect of Beijing existing. Changing the Basic Law to create freedom for HK is almost impossible, and if successful useless anyways, given how Beijing ignores (reinterpret) laws to its own benefit.

IMO there simply isn't enough juice to create change in China yet. Even if CCP collapses who is to say the next government will not be authoritarian? I think education needs to be a priority and we need to wait for all Chinese people to slowly get educated and see what democracy is like. Right now, we have tons of overseas Chinese coming back with a knowledge of democracy. Since people are complacent right now (even in HK as you see tons of people bashing Joshua Wong and they're not CCP shills), I doubt change will happen.When fully developed QR codes are more troublesome than NFC.Well just to clarify I didn't downvote any of you and I'm not sure who is doing that.

I agree that once the economy is not looking that hot, it is easier to create change in China, but I don't know if it's going to happen any time soon.

Also I can't help much anyways; I'm a STEM major and I'm not interested in participating in politics. The most I could do is help the tech sector in HK grow strong, which I'm interested in.Yeah I hate studying so I don't know why I'm hereNice going!

Curious indeed.What a douchebag (not you OP)haha, how can autism be used as an insult?

Only an ignorant cunt would use autism as an insult. (And there's nothing I hate more than ignorance)

Autism is a gift in my case, I have an IQ of over 150 which makes me technically a genius thanks to my autism. I've been going through school all my life being bored out of my fucking brains getting at least 95% on all my tests (and all the incorrect answers were silly mistakes) because I'm just too fucking smart for school I can't wait for everyone else to learn something I already knew within the first day or too of being taught it.

Every ear I scored the best of my year on these stupid multiple choice tests we do and the headmaster came to my class to tell me that, which obviously resulted in being called a 'nerd' which is True but I shouldn't be ridiculed for it.

I recently became home educated so I could learn at my own pace and I'm getting my GCSEs done in 1/4 of the time everyone else has to do it in, I'm also doing more than double the average amount of GCSEs that usually would be done.

I used to get paid \u00a330 an hour working online, which is more than the teaching assistants at my old school earned, it was so fun pointing that out to them

So in conclusion, calling someone autistic is not an insult, in my case it makes me highly gifted.

One more thing, I don't know if this has anything to do with my autism but I am a sociopath so I'm not hindered by irrational emotions like guilt, compassion, empathy, etc.

haha, the most satisfying thing is to know that you will all see this as a waste of a natural gift and that I am undeserving hahaha, that brings me great satisfaction.

Bo Xilai is no more innocent than Xi Jinping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. They may not have murdered anyone directly, but they have definitely had to play some power games to get to where they were or are.China is a well respected member of the international community with multiple friends and allies. China does not want to dominate other countries through fear and intimidation. China has at multiple times kindly asked Japan to resolve the issues through diplomatic channels, but Japan is the one that didn't want to do it. The Western media never reports this.

America and its allies are controlled by Pentagon and the New World Order. They feed their citizens with various forms of mind control, such as Fox News, anti-China shills, and liberal arts colleges. They are also morally bankrupt because they have gays and furries. Not only that, they also have a really bad record of slavery and women oppression. Europe was the ONLY continent to have slavery. No one else has. Even today, America still has slavery in the form of capitalism. Also, women in China have the luxury to sit their month after giving birth, where they can stay at home and enjoy life, but Americans CAN'T because they don't understand 5000 years of medicine.

America will NEVER succeed with its efforts to contain China because China is a nation with long history and superior intellect. The only thing America can hope to do is to peacefully develop with China and establish a harmonious world society. China is proud and poised to share its 5000 years of wisdom with everyone else.

Furthermore, Chinese people all know that psychology and political science subjects are the most useless subjects in existence.Having an Ivy League education means next to nothing for politics IMO. Especially CCP politics.China will grow strong and eliminate bad Western influences like furries, bromances, 4chan, liberal arts colleges, capitalism, obesity, Fox News, and so much more. Just you wait one day when America finally wakes up and joins China in establishing a morally upright new world order with Chinese characteristics.

Unfortunately it seems you are blind to the moral decadence of America. They need some Confucianism and Maoism to get them back on track.

He was part of the US Communist Party and had ties with the higher ranks of CCP. He does not actually hold CCP party membership officially.go fuck the ocean you faggotI'm fully convinced you're a CCP shill by this point. Using CCP sources and touting CCP ideology.

On a serious note, I'd rather vote for a guy to ignore China and focus on domestic issues, because America has tons of issues to fix.Even with "foreign interventions" it is not 0, as you have said.At TH8, you need 3 days to upgrade to Lv 3 DE storage, and in those 3 days you can quickly rack up 20k DE. There is no sense in saving up DE as a TH7 only to be raided by TH8s. Once you're done with DE at TH7 there's nothing to do but to put your DE storage somewhere to protect the gold/elixir storage.

Of course, if you suck at raiding and have a hard time getting DE, then by all means, save up your DE and see TH8s GiBarching and wrecking your base and stealing 1.2k DE per raid. There is nothing to use DE on at TH7 once you finish all the upgrades, because BAM sucks at TH7, and Lv2 hogs are horrible. Only people bad at the game cares about saving useless DE at TH7.What is the point of saving up DE at TH7? You can't use it on **any** upgrade other than the useless Minions to Lv 3 at TH8 without upgrading DE storage to Lv 3. Any decent player will finish DE and wall upgrades halfway through TH7 and at that point there is nothing to use DE on other than BAM, which can be sustained even with the DE storage exposed.

There is a reason to save up DE at the end of TH8 and the end of TH9. There is no reason to do the same at the end of TH7, since it's far easier to do that at the start of TH8.\&gt; implying snoopsnoo can determine whether someone is Chinese

A rocky is a type of rare mineral substance found in rural villages, with the chemical formula Zn2AsO4OH, typically occurring in mountainous areas.

A rainy is a natural condensation native to China usually spotted in rural villages after rainfall, with the chemical formula Zn2OH2O.Are you a faggot? Chopsticks aren't even one inch thick. Man up dude.OP did not write "claims new film."

There isn't any *hard* evidence, and there are multiple possibilities for the abundance of available organs for transplant.Part of the reason why I'm so vocal on Reddit is because if I talk shit IRL people would get so upset even though they are 100x whiter than me. WTF man.

I have close friends who know I talk shit and we get along fine. To others I usually just avoid any touchy stuff and let them be. I've seen countless people getting offended on other people's behalf. It's only getting worse. I'm in a college where this sort of thing is mild compared to the more liberal ones and I already can't stand it. Once these fucktards graduate you'll see the whole society falling to these nutcases. And these nutcases are gonna soar high since they're Ivy League graduates.

People are really easily butthurt in the US, everyone hands down. From white to yellow to black, from man to woman to trans, from straight to bi to gay, everyone gets a share of the butthurt.

Prior research on international education suggests that host country students\u2019 lack of interest in talking to international students is a major cause of international student segregation.  Some Chinese  international  students,  however,  complain  that  although host students want to talk with them about China, they often exhibit misinformed, prejudiced and offensive views of Chinese current events. This has occasionally led to tensions between Chinese international students and host communities. Drawing on interviews and open-ended surveys of Chinese students at an American university, this study shows a variety of positive and negative cross-national interactions and uses  social  identity  theory  to  explain  why  tensions  may  arise.  Negative  reactions  to hearing criticism of one\u2019s home country are often motivated by concerns for status, loyalty, harmony, or utilitarian politics. However, fostering a common group identity and the perception of mutual benevolence among students from different countries can  promote  positive  cross-national  interaction.  Furthermore,  international  students may learn more about democracy and human rights through observing the host society rather than directly discussing these topics with host country members.

tl;dr Chinese guy grows up patriotic, goes to America, gets butthurt, becomes even more patriotic.

Take it or leave it but the humanities majors Chinese ladies I've had the pleasure of talking to were the most enlightened people I've met, being able to see the pros and cons of both political systems and they have a really nice attitude towards everything.

You can easily get 20k DE within 3 days, which is the capacity of Lv2 storage. 3 days is the time for DE storage to get to Lv 3.

Without Lv 3 elixir storage there is nothing useful to upgrade at the beginning of TH8. Rather than trying to protect DE for no reason at TH7, wait until TH8 and get your DE while waiting for storage to upgrade. No time lost at all unless you're bad at raiding.He doesn't understand anything about Chinese culture and those questions are not requirements to be a Chinese.

I don't live in China currently

I'm not white

I'm not an expat

I lived in China and HK combined for 10 years. I talked to Chinese people at a daily rate for at least 17 years.

I understand China better than any of the "Chinese" who never set foot in China and pretends to be a Chinese just because their dad and mom are Chinese.

What's disgusting is that those people are fucking American. Not Chinese. They do stuff the american way and claim to be Chinese just because they went to do see some dragon dance once a year.Finally. The US has long been lacking respect and trust. They lost all honor when they fought in three wars and got completely smashed (Vietnam, Korean, and Terror), meaning no respect for them. Even then, they still don't respect anyone else by poisoning people's minds in the form of internet, making idiotic things like 4chan, hentai, and YouTube (which has retarded people like Miranda Sings).

Furthermore no one can trust US because they spy on their allies like Merkel, and spy on their own people through the NSA. They even give you DMCA notices for downloading reading material on torrent sites. How do they know? Because they SPY on your Downloaded folders. I recommend people renaming everything to a secret name so the NSA will get confused.

It is high time that China, the ever humble and morally upright nation, tell US that this is not the way to achieve prosperity and a harmonious world society. We need to see US improve their human rights and respect their allies.This is not entirely their fault because the government controlled opinion columns have regularly shoehorned the "we buy stuff in HK and they should be grateful" crap into every peasant's radar. Not hard to believe they are now reciting the Chant of "China buys your stuff and makes you rich" line.Plenty of redditors are better than the r/am victim complex.Heh you don't know my ethnicity so you'd better stop while you can get away with spouting BS because you don't know me.

As far as I and a significant majority of Chinese population are concerned, if you never stepped foot in China and didn't even bother learning Chinese at a first language level you're not Chinese and at most a \u534e\u88d4. Don't delude yourselves.Ah, you're ignorant. Hentai originated in the US CIA which they gave the Japanese to mass produce. It's an American invention.

In China you see morally upright and illuminating animations like Pleasant Goat.You're so helpless you don't even dare to use your main and just troll with an alt.That's wrong. The 40 million figure is actually a lie because there are more than 40 million people today so how can they have died??

Furthermore China is South Korea's friend, and the Vietnam War is an American loss. Checkmate.Try to report to the local bao an (guard) and tell them about that girl.

Also tell her explicitly that if she continues to stalk, you would report to relevant authorities.Hey! If you have dragons unlocked, consider joining Salt Miners.It's a 50/50 whether the police would care.

If you do decide the ask the bao an, a small gift may make him more willing to help (the Chinese way to do things) :)

Well it's nice to give your guard small gifts regardless of whether they are helping anyways, so consider that I don't teach English and I don't live in China.

I'm happy with my life unlike your pathetic ass, who feels the need to put down others for no reason :)Eh I guess cigarettes are fine, but I personally don't do that. I give a small fruit basket sometimes.Troops:

Their labs and equipment (at least for STEM) are comparable to top schools in the US. Not joking here. They also do break into top 100.

They also have a great cohort since it is usually the best of the crop that goes there.

The problem lies in academia freedom, language issues, and fame and recognition. Furthermore, foreigners may not get the same opportunities as locals.

But don't expect to get an education comparable to the top schools.China coke sucksI ask for respect and trust from you.

The 40 million figure is wrong and China won the Vietnam war. These are FACTS.

- 40 million died from starvation, not from being killed.

- Vietnam is now Communist.I love reading chinachange texts. Keep posting them!Why would someone mass drag a defenceless?A New Regime, Not a New Country
By Ren Zhiqiang, published: October 3, 2015

Dissent keeps rolling in, not only from \u201cdissidents.\u201d Over the week-long National Day holidays in China, Ren Zhiqiang (\u4efb\u5fd7\u5f37), a high-profile real estate mogul who has earned the nickname \u201cthe Cannon\u201d online for his provocative opinions, took aim at the notion of the \u201cNew China.\u201d  To a global audience, Ren\u2019s argument may seem obvious, but not to the hundreds of millions Chinese who have been indoctrinated, unthinkingly, with the Party\u2019s \u201cNew China.\u201d  \u2014 The Editors

 

On this day [October 1] 66 years ago, the central people\u2019s government of the People\u2019s Republic of China was established. But did this day declare to the world that a new country had emerged, or that a new regime was established to replace the old one?

From the perspective of traditional Chinese culture and international law, China is still the same China. China\u2019s culture, national borders, and treaties signed with other countries in the past\u2014none of these underwent any change. All that happened was the government of the Republic of China under the Nationalists (\u56fd\u6c11\u515a) lost more and more of the area under its control, and the Chinese Communist Party, who said it was representing the interests of the broad masses of the Chinese people, and its People\u2019s Republic of China government, came to control the principle area of mainland China. They announced that they had replaced the Republic of China in governing China, and began to exercise national sovereignty.

Indeed, if the People\u2019s Republic of China is a new country, then it would have no way to carry on the original country\u2019s culture, history, national boundaries, international protocols and diplomatic relations\u2014and in particular, its status in the United Nations and other international organizations would differ.

The so-called \u201cNew China\u201d indicated precisely that it wanted to take over everything of the existing country, but also believed that they had established a new country.

If it\u2019s a new country, then it must have all countries in the world recognize anew its place in the international order, reestablishing their diplomatic ties with the new country. If it\u2019s a new regime, then it needs to contest with the old regime for its international place and relations with other countries\u2014the original international relations don\u2019t change because the regime does. At the same time that the new regime is recognized, it also inherits the former country\u2019s international rights and duties.

The government established on October 1 was only truly recognized by the international community, and had the right to represent China, when Deng Xiaoping walked in the United Nations representing PRC, replacing the Republic of China in the UN and the UN Security Council. Before then, it was the Republic of China government representing China on the world stage.

Before that the PRC government was only recognized by, and had diplomatic relations with, a small number of countries. It\u2019s not that other countries didn\u2019t recognize there was a China, or never thought there could be two Chinas, but that they didn\u2019t recognize that the People\u2019s Republic of China government could represent China\u2014they only recognized that the Republic of China represented China.

From the configuration of permanent member states in the United Nations Security Council, it can be seen that the world didn\u2019t see the People\u2019s Republic of China as a newly established country\u2014they simply looked at whether the new government could represent China. What the PRC inherited was the position of China in the United Nations\u2014the position established during World War II, through the great achievements of the war of resistance against Japan (\u53cd\u6cd5\u897f\u65af\u6218\u4e89)\u2014formerly represented by the Republic of China government.

It\u2019s just as, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the new government of Russia represented the international place formerly occupied by the Soviet Union. Russia isn\u2019t a newly established country\u2014it simply inherited the Soviet Union\u2019s international position and diplomatic relations, including the international agreements signed by the Soviet Union. And the former Soviet Union satellite states, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, each reestablished their respective diplomatic relations and positions in the UN.

It\u2019s precisely because the People\u2019s Republic of China was the sole representative of China\u2019s sovereignty that the Republic of China could no longer represent China in the United Nations or in relations with other countries.  It was only with the permission of the People\u2019s Republic of China that it was allowed to enter these organizations, and participate in international events, under the name of Chinese Taipei.

Even till today, many people living in mainland China still harbor a misunderstanding that October 1 was the birth of a new country. They think that the homeland just had its 66th birthday. But this ancient nation of China has a history of thousands of years. All the changes of dynasty in this country are merely the changes in rulers (or changes in governments who say they represent China\u2019s sovereignty)\u2014they\u2019re not changes of the actual nation.

China is still that nation with a history of thousands of years of traditional culture. Every change in ruler is just a part of the nation\u2019s history\u2014it\u2019s the continuation of history, not a new start.

If you think this is a country with just 66 years of history, then how could there be a 70th anniversary celebration of the war of resistance against Japan? How could there be the successive dynasties of rulers and the teachings of Confucius and Mencius?

When you\u2019re shouting fervent patriotic slogans, please don\u2019t think that the country you love is merely the People\u2019s Republic of China established in 1949, and don\u2019t think that the People\u2019s Republic of China is a newly founded country.

This ancestral land of ours, this nation, also includes all of the history before 1949, and it includes the territory not under the control of the People\u2019s Republic of China, but still under the administration of the Republic of China. You absolutely can\u2019t say that loving Taiwan isn\u2019t loving the homeland, or isn\u2019t loving China.

It\u2019s just like how the people and government of the Republic of China will never acknowledge that the People\u2019s Republic of China is a new country, and have believed all along that there\u2019s only one China\u2014just as how the PRC has never recognized Taiwanese independence, and only recognizes one China. Therefore, we must acknowledge that what was established in 1949 was a new government, not a new country. (If it was a new country, then it would have no right to take as its own a region that it had neither occupied nor exercised administration control over\u2014whereas as a successor state, it could.)

The new government was established by the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, on September 21, 1949, by electing the Central People\u2019s Government.

Thus at the rostrum overlooking Tiananmen Square on October 1, Mao Zedong announced that \u201cthe Central People\u2019s Government has been established.\u201d What was originally planned for the big ceremony held on October 1 was not for the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China, but the ceremony celebrating the establishment of the Central Government.

Every Chinese person must know that on October 1, 1949, what was established was not a new China. China established a new Central People\u2019s Government through the process of consultation and election by multiple political parties! This holiday is not that of the birth of a new country, but the creation of a new government.

When the whole of China celebrates this great holiday, be sure not to forget its original historical aspiration. This holiday does not signify the establishment of a new country, but of China establishing a new central government! Today is not the 66th birthday of our homeland, but the anniversary of a new government.

I hope this new government can abide by the initial promises it made, and actually realize the \u201ccommon platform\u201d it held up when coming to power: bestow the citizens their rights, and bestow them the united front of a democratic system.

***The Reach of the State: Work Units, Family Ties and \u201cHarmonious Demolition\u201d***

**Kevin J. O\u2019Brien and Yanhua Deng***

#Abstract

When faced with homeowners who refuse to accept appropriation of their property, local authorities often use family ties to extend the state\u2019s reach. To complete urban renewal, municipal demolition offices turn to resisters\u2019 relatives who work for government bureaus, state-owned factories, schools and hospitals. Under pressure and the threat of sanctions, many work-unit members agree to pressure their relatives into signing demolition agreements, often by tapping into \u201cfeelings of affection\u201d and emotional blackmail. Beyond emptying a neighborhood, \u201charmonious demolition\u201d has many consequences: it can turn relatives against each other, lead to divorce, and produce disillusionment and anger. Although \u201cdemolition by implicating family members\u201d was banned in 2010, it continues. Using vertical ties to pressure unit members and horizontal ties to influence relatives does not herald a softer authoritarianism, but instead alienates homeowners and work-unit members alike.

Didn't know I had access to this journal until recently.China is not as densely packed with \u201cwork units\u201d (danwei \u5355\u4f4d) as it once was. Many employees of foreign enterprises, private companies and corner shops live outside these institutions, and even those who still belong to a work unit are subject to fewer demands and receive fewer benefits than they did in the past.1 However, work units are hardly gone or forgotten, and continue to influence life far beyond their confines. In particular, when opposition erupts against a local government\u2019s plans, the authorities often turn to work-unit members to assist in quashing resistance.

Work units have always had considerable sway over their members. What is less well known, however, is how local leaders today turn to kinship ties to extend the reach of the state to place pressure on people who do not belong to a work unit. This approach to social control has become especially common when urban neighborhoods are being razed for new construction projects and opposition is intense. Rather than using force on \u201cnail houses\u201d (dingzihu \u9489\u5b50\u6237),2 which the central government has been discouraging, officials responsible for clearing them out frequently initiate \u201charmonious demolition\u201d (hexie chaiqian \u548c\u8c10\u62c6\u8fc1), sometimes also called \u201cdemolition with affection\u201d (qinqing chaiqian \u4eb2\u60c5\u62c6\u8fc1).3 This is also more truthfully known as \u201cdemolition by implicating relatives\u201d (zhulian chaiqian \u682a\u8fde\u62c6\u8fc1): that is, sending work-unit members to apply pressure on their relatives to convince them to relocate, with consequences to them if the relatives fail to cooperate.

Our article will include an analysis of why many relatives who are employed by work units give in to pressure and do the tasks that they are assigned, along with a discussion of how some resist. Whether they cave in or hold out, virtually all feel victimized by the demands that they face. The article concludes by analyzing the implications of our findings for understanding work units and methods of control in today\u2019s China.

#The Cases
Our analysis draws on Chinese media reports of 35 cases of demolition that occurred from 2004 to 2013. Most of our cases are recent: 24 took place in 2010\u201313. All involve \u201cdemolition by implicating homeowners\u2019 relatives\u201d, and most contain detailed information on how local governments used work units and family ties to pressure people to vacate their homes. The cases span 16 provinces and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin. Hunan and Shandong each produced five episodes. The number, distribution and stepped-up coverage of incidents suggests that \u201cdemolition by implicating relatives\u201d appears not only in places controlled by domineering local leaders4 but also in areas that are generally considered examples of good governance. In this sense, the practice is more institutional than personal: a product of high-powered incentives to complete urban renewal and lessen the violence needed to evict homeowners.

Most of the reports appeared in prominent, nationally distributed newspapers, such as China Youth Daily (Zhongguo qingnian bao \u4e2d\u56fd\u9752\u5e74\u62a5), The Beijing News (Xinjing bao \u65b0\u4eac\u62a5), Southern Weekend (Nanfang zhoumo \u5357\u65b9\u5468\u672b) and Southern Metropolitan Daily (Nanfang dushi bao \u5357\u65b9\u90fd\u5e02\u62a5). Six of the articles were published in China Youth Daily and four in The Beijing News, newspapers known for their investigative journalism. Most of the accounts were long, typically exceeding 2,000 characters, and almost all of them benefited from on-the-spot reporting while the incidents were underway. In total, over 100 people, including county leaders, local cadres, factory managers, and homeowners and their relatives, were interviewed in the course of preparing these reports. Some of the stories were praised online,5 and The Beijing News\u2019 coverage of the 2004 \u201cJiahe Incident\u201d ricocheted around the country for weeks.

Owing to the number of accounts and the authorities\u2019 consistent pattern of behavior, we are confident that they reflect a technique of \u201csocial control\u201d (shehui kongzhi \u793e\u4f1a\u63a7\u5236) that local authorities use frequently to induce people to vacate their homes. Heart-tugging stories about local abuses are, of course, common in Chinese newspapers, not least because they boost sales and generate clicks. Some of these reports are undoubtedly \u201cworst-case analyses\u201d and cannot be taken as representative. Still, we believe that collectively our source materials point to a practice that is both common and pathological: common enough to draw attention from higher authorities and the media as case after case appears, and disturbingly systemic, as the newest examples serve as evidence that some of the harshest practices have yet to be curtailed.

Several other factors speak to the reliability of the sources. First, the stories tally with several Chinese scholarly articles on the subject, newspaper editorials and commentaries decrying the practice, and numerous online posts by people who have experienced demolition.6 Second, we have found a similar use of relatives when local authorities have sought to end rural protests.7 Finally, media coverage of the dark side of Chinese politics is usually more reliable than reports that extol the Party-state, because journalists can lose their jobs or even face prosecution if critical stories turn out to be inaccurate.8

#Demolition Offices and Their Work
To push demolition forward, local authorities usually establish special temporary organizations to deal with reluctant homeowners. These organizations are often called \u201cdemolition offices\u201d (chaiqian ban \u62c6\u8fc1\u529e) or \u201cdemolition headquarters\u201d (chaiqian zhihuibu \u62c6\u8fc1\u6307\u6325\u90e8). In some places, they are given euphemistic titles, such as the Ziyang District Ancient City Protection and Construction Headquarters; in others, their names contain a touch of irony, such as the Longling Urban Construction Committee or the Qixian County Redevelopment and Management Headquarters. The short-lived nature of these organizations is evident in their staffing. Typically, they have no (or few) permanent personnel, and almost all their members are drawn from government bureaus and other work units. For example, in Zhangpu County, Fujian, the demolition office enlisted a cohort of over 300 recruits, followed by another of more than 200, mostly seconded from Party offices, government bureaus or schools.9 Special efforts are made by demolition office personnel to locate staff whose relatives live in homes slated for removal. Other methods can be used to gain the compliance of homeowners who do not have relatives in work units. Local authorities may \u201ccapitalize on vulnerabilities\u201d (zhua xiaobianzi \u6293\u5c0f\u8fab\u5b50), including long-ago violations of the family planning policy, unlawful business practices, mistakes made by a homeowner\u2019s children, or a household\u2019s reliance on the \u201cminimum livelihood guarantee\u201d (dibao \u4f4e\u4fdd).

The paperwork behind an order to conduct \u201charmonious demolition\u201d is often as rushed as the formation of the demolition office. For example, in Huili County, Sichuan, the document describing how to facilitate removal and the sanctions for failure was issued by the Demolition and Relocation Leading Group, but the seal at the bottom of the \u201cmeasure to investigate responsibilities\u201d (zeren zhuijiu banfa \u8d23\u4efb\u8ffd\u7a76\u529e\u6cd5) was that of the county Bureau of Land and Resources. A bureau official acknowledged the discrepancy and explained that it arose because \u201cthe leading group\u2019s seal had yet to be approved\u201d. She assumed that \u201call the documents would be redone and reissued\u201d once the new chop was ready.10

Although they are assembled quickly and are usually disbanded once relocation is complete, demolition offices have considerable power. That power is used to pressure work-unit employees to persuade relatives to accept the compensation offered. The heads of demolition offices, who may be county leaders themselves,11 are often ready to dress down work-unit staff members privately or publicly and to punish them financially. In Qixian County, Henan, for instance, the County Redevelopment and Management Headquarters instructed the Labor and Social Security Bureau and the Bureau of Finance to stop paying the salaries of eight workers across four departments, after their relatives refused to sign demolition agreements.12 In Dinggang Town, Jiangsu, when a teacher questioned the principal of her school about the authority of a demolition office to withhold her wages, the principal replied: \u201cThe demolition office indeed doesn\u2019t have this right, but it could report your [poor] performance to the district leadership, which has the right to hold back your salary\u201d.13

Demolition offices are often sprawling operations, with staff members drawn from a wide variety of work units. Kaifeng provides a sense of the scale of these offices. In 2008, there were 22 demolition projects underway. Implementation of a redevelopment plan that affected much of the city entailed recruiting staff from nearly every government department and many other work units.14 Similarly, a large urban renewal program in Huili County, Sichuan, drew personnel from 40 government bureaus and public organizations into the office in charge of \u201cdemolition with affection\u201d. An official in the Huili County Bureau of Land and Resources defended the scope of what became a county-wide mobilization of demolition facilitators: \u201cDemolition is a major project promoted by the county government. A single department can\u2019t complete the task.\u201d15

#Preventing and Handling Opposition to Demolition
If government employees or members of other types of work units are themselves told to relocate, there are many ways for their superiors (or other parties) to pressure them to leave.16 For homeowners who are not attached to work units, however, other methods are used to extend the reach of the state to people not under their direct control.

After a demolition office is set up, a \u201ccontract system\u201d (bao\u2019an zhi \u5305\u6848\u5236) is usually established to expedite evictions. Under this arrangement, government bureaus and other work units themselves are answerable for employees\u2019 relatives who refuse to vacate their homes. Responsibility goes right to the top. In Yangxin County, Hubei, the task of persuading family members was \u201cdirected by work-unit leaders, staffed by ranking cadres, advanced by specialized teams, and supervised by different branches\u201d.17 In Fengcheng County, Jiangxi, contract terms required work-unit leaders to \u201ccarry away\u201d (baozou \u62b1\u8d70) their own \u201cchildren\u201d (haizi \u5b69\u5b50), meaning that they were responsible for ensuring that relatives of unit members left their homes and accepted the compensation offered.18

Motivating work-unit heads to exercise their power over relatives of resisters is extremely important. A Fengcheng County document stated: \u201c\u2018The Number One leader\u2019 (yibashou \u4e00\u628a\u624b) of a work unit contracted with demolition shoulders the ultimate responsibility. The Number One leader should be paddled if he or she doesn\u2019t work hard enough on \u2018thought education\u2019 or tries to avoid conflicts or shirk responsibilities\u201d.19 In Huili County, Sichuan, leaders of work units whose members slacked off in pressuring relatives were punished by having 50 per cent of the leader\u2019s subsidies or merit pay withheld.20 Jiahe County, Hunan, treated failures with equal seriousness. Performance would be taken into account in a work unit\u2019s annual evaluation; top leaders would be held responsible if those beneath them did not get relatives to vacate their homes.21

Collective punishment is also used. In Kaifeng City, hospitals that were unsuccessful in persuading staff members to do thought work on relatives who ignored demolition orders were charged 5,000 yuan for each failure.22 In Juancheng County, Shandong, primary and middle schools were fined 3,000 yuan per day if they did not convince their teachers to get family members to vacate homes scheduled to be torn down.23 Demolition offices and county leaders commonly use a mixture of praise and criticism to highlight units that are doing their work well and to spur laggards on.24 The threat that all work-unit members might lose their year-end bonuses can place enormous pressure on relatives of strong-minded homeowners. For example, two headmasters at a primary school told a teacher whose mother refused to hand over her house: \u201cDon\u2019t implicate so many people and make us all suffer with you. If you drag us all into this, we\u2019ll give you a failing performance evaluation at the end of the year.\u201d25

To curb shirking and to clarify who is responsible for what, local authorities often draw up documents that specify which work unit is accountable for which \u201cnail house\u201d.26 In Hejian, Hebei, county authorities compiled a seven-page table setting out information on 231 homeowners and their kin. After matching names individually, work units were told to persuade their employees\u2019 relatives to leave.27 In Lanxi County, Zhejiang, a woman\u2019s son-in-law was working at the taxation bureau, so the bureau was put in charge of facilitating demolition of her house.28

Local regulations are often used to stiffen the spines of work-unit heads and employees who hesitate to take part in \u201charmonious demolition\u201d. In Qingshuihe County, Inner Mongolia, the county Discipline Inspection Committee and the Party\u2019s Organization Department issued a document that caused a stir and led some cadres to call its provisions \u201cdespotic\u201d (bawang tiaokuan \u9738\u738b\u6761\u6b3e). Among other things, it said:

For relocatees who are immediate family members (parents, parents-in-law and children) of officials with titles of vice section chief or above, the officials must mobilize their relatives to sign an agreement with the demolition company within 10 days. If family members fail to sign and vacate their homes, the Organization Department and the Department of Discipline and Supervision will admonish the officials and suspend them from their posts. After 15 days have passed, if the family members still refuse to sign a demolition agreement without legitimate cause or for reasons not permissible by law, regulation or policy, the officials are to be deprived of their leadership positions and transferred to other jobs. If they are Party members, they will also receive \u201corganizational treatment\u201d (zuzhi chuli \u7ec4\u7ec7\u5904\u7406).29

County authorities in Nayong in Guizhou Province, Taihu in Anhui Province and Ziyang in Hunan Province circulated similar documents explaining how to deal with half-hearted demolition facilitators.30 The best-known example of these regulations was drawn up by the county government and Party committee of Jiahe, Hunan. In 2004, all personnel affiliated with Party organizations, government bureaus and other public institutions were required to provide \u201cfour guarantees\u201d (sibao \u56db\u5305): that relatives would 1) sign demolition agreements, vacate their homes, and surrender ownership certificates; 2) settle down elsewhere; 3) not \u201cwillfully make trouble\u201d (bu wuli qunao \u4e0d\u65e0\u7406\u53d6\u95f9); and 4) not participate in collective petitions or lawsuits. Those who failed to deliver on these guarantees were subject to \u201ctwo suspensions\u201d (liangting \u4e24\u505c): suspension of salary and suspension from office.31

Work-unit members who do not throw themselves into demolition work may find themselves marginalized. For example, after his daughter refused to leave her apartment and filed an administrative lawsuit, Chen Long, a vice director of the Bureau of City Management in Taihu County, Anhui, felt like a \u201csurplus person\u201d (duoyu de ren \u591a\u4f59\u7684\u4eba) at the office. His subordinates stopped reporting to him and no one notified him when meetings were scheduled. A vice director of the county Organization Bureau warned him that much more might follow:

It used to be hard to demote cadres like you so long as you didn\u2019t make mistakes. But now it\u2019s easy to do so through organizational treatment. What\u2019s organizational treatment? It\u2019s different from \u201cdisciplinary sanctions\u201d (jil\u00fc chufen \u7eaa\u5f8b\u5904\u5206) and has various forms. It includes criticism, warnings, suspension, transfer, deprivation of job title and removal from office. In short, there\u2019s a series of measures. The county Organization Department or Personnel Bureau can choose how to deal with you, depending on the situation.32

Moral appeals may also be layered on top of financial penalties and career consequences. The vice secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee in Nayong County, Guizhou, said that cadres must set an example and \u201ctake the lead [in promoting demolition], since the masses are watching\u201d.33 When Chen Long refused to pressure his daughter to accept eviction on the terms offered, one of his former superiors, who by this time worked elsewhere, was sent back to conduct thought work on him. Chen\u2019s \u201cold leader\u201d (lao lingdao \u8001\u9886\u5bfc) told him: \u201cYou and your wife are civil servants, and in particular work in law enforcement. We therefore have greater expectations of you than we have for ordinary people. You should have higher consciousness and be of higher quality, and do as you\u2019re told\u201d.34 The Party secretary of the Political Legal Committee in Jiahe County went so far as to say: \u201cWe\u2019re all Party cadres and [can be called upon to] shed our blood and lose our lives. Small issues like promoting demolition really pale in comparison to those sacrifices.\u201d35

Most likely because their day-to-day responsibilities do not involve administrative enforcement, and because they are expected to be exemplars and \u201cengineers of people\u2019s souls\u201d (linghun gongchengshi \u7075\u9b42\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08), moral appeals are especially common when encouraging teachers to participate. In Changsha, a teacher was informed that, because she had a high level of education, she should help the government to complete redevelopment and publicize its advantages.36 The vice director of the Longling, Yunnan, Committee for Urban Construction argued that teachers should be reminded of their position and told to act in line with the public interest instead of being selfish.37 A primary-school teacher in Dinggang Town, Jiangsu, was said to have low consciousness and to \u201clack the ethics of a teacher\u201d (meiyou shide \u6ca1\u6709\u5e08\u5fb7) when she failed to persuade her parents to sign a demolition agreement. An official at the Bureau of Social Development instructed her to learn from the \u201cmoral excellence\u201d (gaoshang pinde \u9ad8\u5c1a\u54c1\u5fb7) of colleagues who worked tirelessly on family members and even subsidized their move when the compensation offered was too low.38

Some types of work-unit employees are harder to persuade or coerce. For example, the managers and workers of state-owned business enterprises (SOEs) are typically mentioned alongside government personnel and teachers as potential thought workers, but seldom figure prominently in the examples that follow. This could be because, unlike employees of government offices and schools, they are better able to deflect demands to participate in pressuring relatives. SOE workers are sought out by demolition offices, but may be able to slip out of their grasp because most SOEs have become more autonomous in the reform era. Government workers and teachers remain far more dependent on the state for their salaries, benefits and promotions and have fewer resources with which to resist calls to apply pressure on their relatives. SOEs that are performing poorly may also have less say over their workers, while managers with high salaries and with options to move out of the state sector may be able to brush off demands to participate. In short, all work-unit members are not the same, and the hold that the state has over different parts of the public sector varies.

#To Submit or Resist
In the face of unremitting pressure and likely sanctions, many of the work-unit employees profiled in the 35 cases gave in, with only a few standing up and fighting back, or finding other ways to avoid complying.

The threat of reprisals normally works. According to Wang Cailiang, a lawyer who focuses on land and demolition disputes, work-unit members are simply \u201cnot in a position to resist\u201d (meiyou tiaojian dikang \u6ca1\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u62b5\u6297)39 because local authorities have power over them and can punish them. A teacher in Chaling County, Hunan, explained: \u201cThe only thing we can do is wait. Teachers count as \u2018government employees\u2019 (gongwu renyuan \u516c\u52a1\u4eba\u5458). We dare not cause a big row, for fear of retaliation.\u201d40 A cadre from Hanshan County, Anhui, lamented: \u201cYou can\u2019t guess what organizational measures they\u2019ll use, and you never have a say in the process. Since you can\u2019t predict the future, the only thing you can do is: Obey! Obey!\u201d41

Being poorly positioned to resist, work-unit members generally feel little choice but to pressure their relatives into signing a demolition agreement. To do so, they often resort to emotional blackmail and tap into \u201cfeelings of affection\u201d. For example, a police officer in Ziyang, Henan, was assigned to persuade his older sister to give up her store and its desirable location. His superiors leaned on him so hard that he could not bear it any longer. He pleaded desperately with his sister, ultimately writing her a text message: \u201cfamily affection is more important than money\u201d. She broke down and agreed to accept the resettlement offer.42 In Gongyi County, Henan, a woman was sent to conduct thought work on her grandmother. Overcome with worries that she would lose her job at a carpet factory, the woman knelt down and begged: \u201cGrandma, please sign the document. Otherwise they won\u2019t let me go back to work. You know how hard it is to find a job these days.\u201d The old lady, crying, signed the agreement.43 Invoking career consequences is a common tactic used to soften up older, \u201cuncooperative\u201d family members. In Beihai City, Guangxi, for instance, a schoolteacher implored her mother to give in, saying: \u201cMom, I won\u2019t blame you if you don\u2019t agree to sign, but our house will be torn down anyway. How terrible it would be if we lost our home and I also ended up jobless.\u201d44

Some work-unit members even demean themselves or employ deception to complete their assignment. A middle-school teacher in Hanshan County, Anhui, who had always been a model of success in his family, used every method he could think of to get his sister to cave in, finally resorting to rolling on the floor, kicking and screaming. His sister and brother-in-law ultimately accepted the demolition agreement.45 In Lixian County, Hebei, a government worker could not withstand the pressure when her parents refused to give up their land. She signed the requisition document on her father\u2019s behalf and, before her parents knew they had \u201cagreed\u201d to it, their peach trees had been chopped down.46

To save a relative\u2019s home, employees required to participate in demolition work may quit their job, as a vice section chief did in Taihu County, Anhui.47 They may also \u201csever relations\u201d (duanjue guanxi \u65ad\u7edd\u5173\u7cfb) with a family member. A case in point was an official in the Kaifeng Bureau of Culture who was unwilling to urge his father to accept a low compensation offer, so he announced that he had cut all ties with his father.48 Sometimes the initiative goes the other way, with a homeowner taking the lead to protect a relative. In an effort to shield her son, who was the discipline inspection chief of the municipal management bureau, a woman on the relocation list in Suining, Hunan, claimed that she had severed all ties with him.49

This seldom works, however, because simply announcing the end of a relationship is often seen as a ruse, and the authorities may refuse to acknowledge it. Divorce is more effective because it comes with a certificate issued by the local government. A divorce may be real but a sham (real officially but fake emotionally).50 It may also be temporary and reversed shortly after demolition is completed or averted.51 Among the 35 cases, 10 witnessed couples divorcing or beginning proceedings to dodge demolition work. In Jiahe, Hunan, at least five couples split up to save their spouses\u2019 jobs. This tactic briefly became so popular that it was said that the county Bureau of Civil Affairs refused to accept new divorce filings, and a 50-year-old official had to go to another city to divorce his wife in order to distance himself from his brother-in-law, who was refusing to cooperate with a demolition order.52

Media exposure can also be helpful. After a female employee was transferred to a demolition office to facilitate the removal of her mother-in-law\u2019s home, she posted her transfer notice on Weibo and asked: \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Her query drew the attention of Southern Weekend (one of China\u2019s most influential newspapers) and put the local authorities in a difficult spot.53 Even though her blog was deleted within 24 hours, distressed public employees in the same situation responded. A discipline inspection chief in the Suining City Management Bureau had similarly been transferred to a demolition office in order to persuade his mother and uncle to turn over a home they had inherited from his grandfather. He heard about the Southern Weekend report and posted an essay online, to which the county government replied, claiming that his transfer to the demolition headquarters was a routine personnel move. He immediately wrote another web essay making his name and phone number public. A flurry of media reports followed, and within two weeks he was given his post back and released from further demolition work. Though a victory of sorts, his mother and uncle did not fare as well: his grandfather\u2019s land and residence were requisitioned according to \u201clegal procedures\u201d.54

Finally, the willingness of a work unit to assist an employee may influence the outcome. For instance, a work unit may facilitate demolition but help improve the terms and make it more palatable to its employee\u2019s relative.55 In Pengshan County, Sichuan, the Bureau of Education paid a 20,000 yuan subsidy to convince a bureau member\u2019s relative to sign a demolition agreement.56 A unit may also stand with one of its members and try to fend off execution of a demolition order. In Changsha, staff from the demolition office visited a teacher\u2019s school so frequently that the principal and her colleagues came to recognize their faces, and sent text messages warning her to leave when people from the demolition office arrived.57

#Feeling Victimized
\u201cDemolition by implicating relatives\u201d leaves many work-unit members, leaders and employees alike, in a state of helplessness. They say that they feel powerless to resist, and see \u201cno way out\u201d. Although \u201charmonious demolition\u201d extends the reach of the state in the short run, over the long term it threatens to alienate people who have benefited from Party rule and have been well-disposed toward the regime.58

\u201cDemolition with affection\u201d can turn relatives against each other and cause a family to unravel. As an official in Jiahe, Hunan, put it: \u201cThe practice of implicating relatives has made Jiahe a terrible place: relations between fathers and sons are strained, couples have broken up, and siblings have become enemies\u201d.59 When a cadre in the County Planning Commission was let go because his sister would not cooperate with demolition, the man told his sister that she should consider him dead. In Suining, Hunan, the wife of a discipline inspection chief wrote in her divorce petition:

The plaintiff and the defendant have been married for more than 20 years. They have loved each other and have maintained very good conjugal affection \u2026 Demolition by implicating homeowners\u2019 relatives has, however, devastated the plaintiff. She\u2019s afraid that she might be implicated again and has experienced great pain in filing to divorce a husband she loves dearly.60

The court rejected the case, because it had never seen a justification like this.
Disillusionment and rage are common among work-unit members. After she received a notice transferring her to a demolition headquarters, the Changsha schoolteacher mentioned above wrote on Weibo: \u201cHere and now, I hate demolition. It isn\u2019t what it\u2019s advertised to be: a process that will give people a better life, happiness and an environmentally conscious society. It\u2019s destroying my happiness. It\u2019s deceptive. It\u2019s my nightmare.\u201d61 A vice director of the City Management Bureau in Taihu, Anhui, told a reporter that one of his friends, who was a vice section chief in another bureau, was hurt so deeply by being forced into demolition work that he gave up his position and \u201cbroke with the system\u201d (yu tizhi juelie \u4e0e\u4f53\u5236\u51b3\u88c2).62

\u201cDemolition by implicating relatives\u201d affects not only those drawn into it; other unit members, watching it unfold around them, know that they could easily be next. An official in the County Government Office in Qingshui, Gansu, explained: \u201cIt\u2019s understandable that demolition has caused problems among family members \u2026 But the widespread panic among government employees caused by this wave of demolition can\u2019t be eased in the short term. Other officials worry that one day they could be implicated themselves.\u201d63

Effects can also linger. A schoolteacher in Zhenjiang City, Jiangsu, felt no relief after the district government ordered that she be paid two months\u2019 back salary and that her principal and a township leader call on her to apologize for what she had gone through during a contentious eviction. The teacher remained concerned that she had offended so many people that she would be treated poorly in the future.64

#Some Implications
\u201cDemolition by implicating relatives\u201d frequently works. Homeowners are persuaded to leave and houses are torn down. The pressures placed on public-sector employees (through work units) and on homeowners (through family ties) are often potent enough to induce people to vacate their homes on the terms offered.

The consequences of this approach to social control, however, go beyond emptying out a neighborhood and allowing urban renewal to occur. For one, \u201charmonious demolition\u201d draws work units into bullying and intimidation, in an era when they do not dominate the landscape as they once did. Through high-powered incentives and hierarchical commands, work units continue to operate directly on the people in them, and even unit leaders are subject to the orders from above and find limited room to ignore demands if superiors insist. With more Chinese living outside the confines of bureaucratic control, this web of discipline has been extended, and work units are expected to reach out and browbeat people not employed by them. This also occurred during the Maoist period, but is resorted to more often today when fewer and fewer urbanites remain in full-fledged units. The powers of the work-unit system are evolving in tandem with market reforms and the spatial reorganization of Chinese cities.65 Relying on vertical ties to control and coerce unit members and horizontal ties to influence those \u201cone degree of separation\u201d away, work units remain a multi-pronged tool to penetrate society.

\u201cHarmonious demolition\u201d also tells us much about \u201csoft repression\u201d66 in China at a time when the national government has sought to reduce the use of violence against protesters. In the same manner that paying off the disgruntled has become a common way to end contention67 and bargaining with homeowners in government offices can thwart popular action before it begins,68 \u201charmonious demolition\u201d is used to address both isolated and community-wide opposition and to head off \u201cmass incidents\u201d (quntixing shijian \u7fa4\u4f53\u6027\u4e8b\u4ef6) without resorting to harsher forms of repression that could easily backfire.69 After a decade of unremitting attention to \u201cstability maintenance\u201d (weiwen \u7ef4\u7a33), the local state has developed a varied arsenal of weapons to cope with discontent. Though there are dangers of exaggerating the authorities\u2019 effectiveness in pre-empting, policing and stopping protest, local responses to resistance range from instant concessions to immediate suppression, and much in between.70

That \u201cdemolition by implicating relatives\u201d falls on the soft side of the repression ledger and avoids the use of physical force does not imply a less heavy-handed authoritarianism. In fact, the use of semi-masked, indirect techniques of domination reminiscent of \u201cguilt by association\u201d (lianzuo \u8fde\u5750) in imperial China could point in the opposite direction, as control becomes more intrusive and harder to escape, much as it was during the Maoist era, when work-unit controls were supplemented by ideological campaigns and other forms of political pressure. For all the benefits and inducements doled out to win cooperation from social groups crucial to development, threats and sanctions (for work-unit members) and emotional blackmail (for their unfortunate relatives) are elements of the control regime that are deployed when money fails to placate the dissatisfied and violence seems inadvisable. China\u2019s authoritarianism can, at times, be as smothering as it was in the past.

But perhaps the situation is not quite so dire as it appears. It is True that \u201charmonious demolition\u201d can be a horrible experience for work-unit members and homeowners, and alienating millions of relocatees and many mid-level cadres does not seem an astute way to maintain legitimacy and popular support. In particular, it is unwise to abuse key beneficiaries of Party rule and to make powerful heads of government bureaus, schools and hospitals feel like victims of unjust authority and \u201csoft violence\u201d (ruan baoli \u8f6f\u66b4\u529b).71 We are not the only ones who have recognized this. Why are cases of \u201cdemolition by implicating homeowners\u2019 relatives\u201d discussed in detail in China\u2019s state-run media, and why are these accounts uniformly critical? In May 2010, the State Council issued an urgent circular banning \u201cdemolition by implicating homeowners\u2019 relatives\u201d.72 Although the practice continues (nearly half of our cases occurred after 2010), officials in the upper reaches of government realize that controlling work-unit members through harsh sanctions and pressuring them to lean on their relatives to achieve state ends is not a formula for long-term success, and instead is a sign of over-reach, desperation and incentives gone amok.

50 When asked whether her divorce was genuine, Lin Xin in Minhou County, Fujian, said: \u201cWe were forced to divorce. Is there another way out? We have to appear to be breaking up in public.

52 Luo Changping, \u201cChaiqian yinfa jiemei tongri lihun\u201d. Even divorce does not always provide a reliable way out.

55 High-ranking local officials who come under pressure to persuade relatives to move can be well positioned to help their relatives obtain more compensation.

Hey if you read this, you look OK (I can imagine lots of girls liking the "scholar" look), but honestly you don't look ALPHA AT ALL. Even I look more alpha than you and I'm beta af.Aren't you the guy who want to come to China? Thought you were like 20 something.wat

Yeah the American ones rarely get reported.Your troops? I personally recommend maxing everything at TH7.You're a new user that's why. I'll upvote your comments to give you some karma since it helps :)

I personally have no restrictions in most subs that I go to.Why would you need to face TH9s as a TH8?If someone is able to do so, you could use waifu to upscale CoC textures/sprites.

Tried it on some cartoonish games before and the result is good.No TH7 can reliably stop a TH8 from stealing all your loot.A feeder clan is a second clan that is related to the main clan. In a feeder clan people usually observe new clanmates and see if they are doing well (pushing trophies, wars etc.), and if they are good, they get promoted to the main clan.

Feeder clans can also have other purposes such as for farming in cheap wars, training new strategies etc.LOL I live in America.http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1863863/grandfather-was-first-chinese-graduate-west-point-says

Meanwhile I'm having fun at my top 5 college studying rigorous science; I don't quite care what you think of my IQ.

Getting 20k DE in 3 days is easy enough; you only need around 30 ~ 40 raids to achieve that, and you can easily do 15 raids per day using a solid layout. If you can't do that, then I wonder how you're going to finish all the DE upgrades at TH8 on time, much less grinding heroes at TH9.Ah, see, perhaps next time you shouldn't insult other people's IQ without knowing who they are.

Anyone can get 20k DE in 3 days if they have the proper knowledge to do so. 20k DE is very little DE.Chicago

Unlock DE storage, new instant traps, spell factory 3, lab 5, and barracks 9 first.

Next unlock BK, start upgrading all barracks to 9, new army camp all the way to 6, and put down new defenses but do not upgrade them. Do not put hidden teslas yet. Research dragon 2

Next put dark barracks and DE drill. Research troops you farm with to max TH7 levels.

Next upgrade DE storage, and upgrade AD. Upgrade collectors to 11 with only 1 builder slowly.

Upgrade BK to 5, rage and heal to 4 should be your next priority. After finishing DE storage to 2 and both AD to 5, start upgrading your other defenses.

I found his rant hilariousRage 4 is good for TH7 vs TH8 attacks.Raiding at TH6 is actually not that difficult once you unlock healers. You can easily 3 star any TH6s even without healers. Rushing to TH7 would not make a huge difference in ease of raiding. If you rush to TH7, you are unlikely be able to raid any TH7s properly for a while anyways, so there's little point in doing that IMO.

BARCH and the 200 army size is probably the only reason why people rush to TH7, but honestly, other forms of attacks (Giant variants are better IMO) are way better at TH6 and TH7, and you don't need 170 army camp size to raid well. TH6s are ridiculously easy to roll over.http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/employment/temporary.html~~This is a shit tier article that amounts to nothing.~~

I am confused at what the article is trying to say. It doesn't seem to have a conclusion. Doesn't seem to have anything to do with finance. Didn't even explain any important details.That really is not a conclusion since it doesn't really tell us anything meaningful. It really sounds like a political commentary than something solid.The reason why I said the article is shit because:

1. It's an emotional claim

2. Only backed up by limited anecdotal evidence

3. Does not offer any meaningful solution

The article rabbles on with no end and goal in sight. I have no idea what the article is trying to accomplish than a "CCP is manipulative and are only friendly to businesses until they are no longer useful" narrative, which, well, is unrelated to finance and also quite the useless claim.

I've been following the Li events and have read those texts. Perhaps the author should carefully analyze the potential outcomes with investment in China caused by this diplomatic fallout rather than tout a meaningless political commentary, which again, has nothing to do with finance, and may even be unimportant in the grand scheme of things. I'd be more interested in seeing how politics interfere with investment in China, and why that is bad for businesses, rather than "CCP betrayed Li!"

By the way, I don't typically bash an article if I don't see at least one other comment bashing it as well (on FT itself).I'm sure our friends at /r/sino will be able to tell you why you are wrong and why your accusations are destroying Chinese economy and Asian masculinity.IMO TH6s are so easy to raid even at TH6 levels that there is barely an advantage to rush to TH7. That was my point. If you do rush to TH7 from TH5, you will be wrecked by TH6s, TH7s and TH8s due to the higher frequency of them seeing you. At TH6 you will only be wrecked by TH6s and TH7s.

It's ridiculously easy to raid at TH6 even with 135 camp size, so I see no distinct advantage of rushing to TH7 (you really can't make it any easier when it's already brain-dead easy level) unless you want to war.

There is no huge setback for rushing to TH7, that is clear. I just don't think the advantages are that huge. Level 4 GiBarch is a huge improvement, but Lv 3 GiBarch can also wreck TH6s easily anyways.Financial Times should focus on **finance** because that's what readers expect from them.

How fucking typical#Challenging Myths About China\u2019s One-Child Policy
***Martin King Whyte, Wang Feng, and Yong Cai***

---

**Abstract**


China\u2019s controversial one-child policy continues to generate controversy and misinformation. This essay challenges several common myths: that Mao Zedong consistently opposed efforts to limit China\u2019s population growth; that consequently China\u2019s population continued to grow rapidly until after his death; that the launching of the one-child policy in 1980 led to a dramatic decline in China\u2019s fertility rate; and that the imposition of the policy prevented 400 million births. Evidence is presented contradicting each of these claims. Mao Zedong at times forcefully advocated strict limits on births and presided over a major switch to coercive birth planning after 1970; as much as three-quarters of the decline in fertility since 1970 occurred before the launching of the one-child policy; fertility levels fluctuated in China after the policy was launched; and most of the further decline in fertility since 1980 can be attributed to economic development, not coercive enforcement of birth limits.

Reproduction without an Institutional Licensee is prohibited.In 2013, with the merger of the National Population and Birth Planning1 Commission and the Ministry of Health to form a new National Health and Population Planning Commission in March and the announcement of a partial relaxation of the one-child policy in November, China embarked on a journey that may eventually end the most extreme and controversial policy of birth control in human history.2 In the last three decades and more, numerous studies have been devoted to examining the policy\u2019s origin, enforcement and effects. Yet confusion and myths remain, not only among the public but also in scholarly publications.

One example is an article published in this journal. Issue No. 72 of The China Journal contains a very interesting analysis by Yan Wei and Li Zhang of the record of Yicheng, Shanxi, in implementing a two-child rather than a one-child policy since 1980.3 Although the details on how Yicheng carried out a two-child policy are fascinating and we are in substantial agreement with their conclusions about the Yicheng experience, the authors set the context for their analysis with statements about the origins of mandatory birth limits that are incorrect. For example, in describing the situation in the 1970s, they state: \u201cthe state never extended its birth-limitation efforts to rural areas and set no numerical demographic targets at the national level until the late 1970s\u201d (p. 102). Their contention that the switch from voluntary to coercively enforced birth planning only occurred after 1980 is contradicted by a large amount of prior research.4

Nor is this example from the article about Yicheng County an isolated instance of mistaken generalizations about the historical record. In his otherwise masterful account of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s role in transforming China after the death of Mao Zedong, Ezra Vogel deals only very briefly with the origins of the one-child policy, but when he does he also gets the facts wrong: \u201cWhen Mao was alive, despite some educational programs and the supplying of birth control devices, birth control made little headway\u201d.5

Erroneous statements such as these are quite common. There is a need to set the record straight regarding a series of myths about the origins and record of China\u2019s coercive birth planning regime. Even though an accurate picture is already available from prior research and publications, key features of that record have too often been ignored or forgotten. We use this opportunity to challenge a series of such myths, and not just the specific erroneous claims cited above.

Common myths about the origins and record of China\u2019s policy include the following:

1. Mao Zedong was and remained an ardent pro-natalist until the end. Despite some periods in which he allowed voluntary birth planning efforts, it was only possible to switch to a much more concerted national effort to enforce fertility limits after his death.

2. Due to the obstruction that Mao\u2019s stance on population issues created, China\u2019s population continued to grow at a rapid and uncontrolled rate until after his death, necessitating the contemplation of a more drastic and coercive program, the mandatory policy enforced after 1980.

3. Once the transition from voluntary birth planning campaigns to the highly coercive one-child policy was launched in 1980, Chinese fertility rates began a sharp descent, eventually reaching sub-replacement levels of fertility (below a total fertility rate of 2.1 births per woman6) by about 1990 and in the years that followed.

4. However coercive and objectionable the one-child policy may be, the campaign led to the prevention of at least 400 million births. China today and perhaps the world in general are better off in multiple ways as a result of that success in controlling population size.#**Was Mao a Pro-Natalist?**

Each of these generalizations is at least highly misleading, and in many particulars completely wrong. We start with Mao\u2019s pro-natalist record. It is certainly True that Mao is on record on several occasions as stating that population growth was not a problem in a socialist country like China, but such statements were more philosophical and ideological than practical. Mao made his best-known statement on this subject shortly before the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, in September 1949. In a rebuttal of statements by Dean Acheson, US Secretary of State under President Truman, who considered overpopulation a main source of China\u2019s revolution, Mao proclaimed:

&gt; It is a very good thing that China has a big population. Even if China\u2019s population multiplies many times, she is fully capable of finding a solution; the solution is production. The absurd argument of Western bourgeois economists like Malthus that increases in food cannot keep pace with increases in population was not only thoroughly refuted in theory by Marxists long ago, but has also been completely exploded by the realities in the Soviet Union and the Liberated Areas of China after their revolutions.7

However, such rhetoric does not mean that Mao favored promoting population growth or that he consistently opposed efforts to reduce China\u2019s birth rate.
Mao\u2019s approach to population issues after 1949 was more practical than ideological. By the mid-1950s, confronted with the challenges of managing the country and feeding its population, Mao and other leaders began to sing a different tune. At the Eighth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 1956, Premier Zhou Enlai gave a speech in which he twice mentioned the need to advocate birth control. Early the following year, in the original version of his famous speech of 27 February 1957, \u201cOn the Correct Handling of Contradictions among the People\u201d, Mao Zedong conveyed the same idea in much more detailed terms:

&gt; Our country has so many people, which no country in the world can compare with. It would be better to have fewer births. (Re)production needs to be planned. In my view, humankind is completely incapable of managing itself. It has plans for production in factories, for producing cloth, tables and chairs, and steel, but there is no plan for producing humans. This is anarchism\u2014no governing, no organization and no rules. This government perhaps needs to have a special ministry\u2014what about a ministry of birth control? Or perhaps establishing a commission, as part of the government?8

By late 1957, the urgency which Mao attached to birth control had increased. In his speech concluding the Enlarged Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered on 9 October 1957, Mao remarked:

&gt; Of course birth control is still necessary, and I am not for encouraging more births. There should be a ten-year program for promoting birth control: three years for pilot programs and publicity, three years for promotion and expansion, and four years for universal implementation. It would be too late to wait until our population size reaches 800 million. While we don\u2019t promote birth control in ethnic minority areas, nor in sparsely populated mountainous areas, we still need to have the idea debated and heard. I think birth control should be part of the middle school curriculum. It\u2019s not OK to have human reproduction in a state of total anarchy\u2014we need birth planning.9

It is True that by the following year, believing that socialism and the Great Leap Forward would solve China\u2019s food security problems, Mao became less worried about population growth, but he still believed in the ultimate desirability of birth control, albeit not in the short term. For example, on 28 May 1958, he said, \u201cWe are not afraid of a population of 800 million or one billion. American reporters say that after 100 years, the Chinese population will constitute 50 per cent of the world population. By that time, our cultural level will be high. When all the people are college educated, they will naturally practice birth control.\u201d10 On 17 August 1958, in a Politburo meeting, he made another comment on population: \u201cWe need to change our thinking about population. I have said to control it within 800 million, but I now see that it would not be a problem to go over 1 billion. There is no need to advocate for more births. Fertility control goes together with improvement in education.\u201d11

However, even before the end of the massive famine caused by the Great Leap Forward, Mao had reverted to expressing more concern about the need to limit births. In his conversation with General Montgomery on 27 May 1960, Mao said that the population in China would grow by 100 million, not 150 million as suggested by Montgomery: \u201cWe are working to control our population growth\u201d. Several years later, in a conversation with the Minister of Health on 20 August 1965, Mao made two comments related to birth control. \u201cTianjin provided birth control for free. While it looked like an economic loss to the state on the surface, the real effect is just the opposite \u2026 You need to include birth control when you launch rural health programs.\u201d12 In talking with the American journalist Edgar Snow in 1965 and again in 1971, Mao Zedong complained that too few in rural China were using contraceptives.13

Finally, while not much is available in official documents on Mao\u2019s thinking on population matters during the 1960s and 1970s, from the record it is clear that Mao returned to the assessment of China\u2019s need for birth control that he had made in 1957. China\u2019s Birth Planning Commission within the State Council was established in 1964 to lead birth-control efforts, shortly after China\u2019s population growth recovered from the devastating Great Leap Forward famine, and exactly as proposed by Mao in his speech in 1957. China also developed its own version of the contraceptive pill by the mid-1960s and expanded the national distribution and propaganda network devoted to promoting birth control.14

We do not have much evidence on what Mao was thinking about population issues toward the end of his life but, given his supreme position at the time, we can be sure that he must have signed off on the very decisive shift that China made from voluntary to mandatory and highly coercive birth planning enforcement after 1970 (not after 1980). In 1971, China\u2019s State Council approved a report on birth control, setting the goals of reducing the annual rate of population growth from 2.5 per cent in 1970 to 1 per cent in cities and 1.5 per cent in rural areas by 1975 as part of the fourth Five-Year Plan. In 1975 and for the subsequent Five-Year Plan, birth-control goals were further ramped up, aiming to reduce the annual rate of population growth from 1.57 per cent in 1975 to 1 per cent in rural areas and 0.6 per cent in cities by 1980.15 These were the policy decisions that launched China on a dramatically tougher birth planning effort in the closing years of Mao\u2019s life.#Was China\u2019s Birth Control Program Voluntary in the 1970s?

With these ambitious goals a national campaign of mandatory birth planning was put into full motion. The slogan that summarized the three demographic components of the campaign was \u201clater, longer, and fewer\u201d (wan, xi, shao \u665a\u3001\u7a00\u3001\u5c11). \u201cLater\u201d referred to the effort to enforce late marriage\u2014at least after age 25 for brides and 27 or 28 for grooms in the city, and after 23 for brides and 25 for grooms in the countryside. \u201cLonger\u201d referred to requiring greater intervals between permitted births\u2014at least four years. \u201cFewer\u201d meant limits on the number of births allowed\u2014no more than two children for urban families and three for rural families, with penalties for those who did not comply.

The post-1970 campaign in no way relied simply upon persuasion or voluntary compliance. Many of the coercive enforcement techniques that became notorious after the one-child policy was launched in 1980 actually date from this \u201clater, longer, fewer\u201d campaign of the 1970s.16 The state bureaucratic hierarchy in charge of enforcing birth control then oversaw grass-roots birth planning workers in each village, urban work unit and neighborhood. These birth planning enforcers kept detailed records on each woman of child-bearing age under their responsibility, including past births, contraceptive usage and even menstrual cycles, in many reported instances becoming \u201cmenstrual monitors\u201d who tried to detect out-of-quota pregnancies at an early stage.17 In some factories, there were quotas for reproduction as well as for production, and a woman employee who did not receive a birth allotment was not supposed to get pregnant (even if she had not yet reached her two-child maximum). Women who became pregnant without permission were subjected to regular harassment to get an abortion, with pressure also on their husbands and other family members. In rural areas, women who gave birth to a third child were similarly pressured to get sterilized or have IUDs inserted, while urban women were more trusted to continue using effective contraception until they were no longer fertile (although not trusted enough to dispense with regular menstrual cycle checks). Families were threatened that, if they persisted in having an over-quota birth, the baby would be denied household registration (and thus denied opportunities for ration coupons, schooling and other essential benefits that depended upon registration).

Published statistics from Chinese official sources confirm the coercive, campaign-driven nature of China\u2019s birth planning program in the 1970s. As shown in Figure 1, although not as extreme as China\u2019s 1983 sterilization and abortion high tide following the launch of the one-child policy, birth-control operations (abortions, IUD insertions and sterilizations) shot up several times during the 1970s in association with the campaign to enforce birth limits. In the early days of the \u201clater, longer, fewer\u201d program, IUD insertion, female sterilization and induced abortions all increased sharply. IUD insertions more than doubled in two years, from 6.17 million in 1971 to 13.95 million in 1973; female sterilization operations increased by nearly 70 per cent, from 1.74 million to 2.95 million; and induced abortions increased by 30 per cent, from 3.91 to 5.11 million. By 1975, the number of IUD insertions, female sterilizations and induced abortions all reached historic highs at levels that were, respectively, 270 per cent, 217 per cent and 130 per cent of the levels in 1971. In 1979, immediately prior to the formal announcement of the one-child policy, there was another push for birth-control medical operations. Nationwide, the number of birth-control operations rose nearly 50 per cent in one year, from 21.72 million in 1978 to 30.58 million in 1979. Female sterilizations more than doubled in the same one-year period, from 2.51 to 5.29 million, and induced abortions rose from 5.39 to 7.86 million. These drastic increases in birth-control operations can hardly be consTrued as indicative of voluntary birth planning.

Prior to 1980, abuses resulting from efforts to enforce fertility limits also became common. Just prior to the launch of the one-child policy, Steven Mosher reported that dozens of \u201cover-quota\u201d pregnant women in his rural Guangdong field site during 1979\u201380 were ordered confined in the brigade headquarters, not able to go home for days, if not weeks, while being subjected to harangues to get them to consent to abortions. He also documented local instances of third trimester \u201cCaesarean abortions\u201d18 more than three decades prior to Feng Jianmei\u2019s forced late-term abortion, which became an Internet sensation in 2012.19#Did the Post-Mao One-Child Policy Help Reduce China\u2019s Fertility?

It is thus clear that highly coercive birth planning enforcement was already the order of the day during the 1970s, in both rural and urban areas, and preceding the launching of the one-child policy. The record is equally clear that China during that decade experienced among the most dramatic declines in fertility in human history. Far from being \u201cout of control\u201d, China\u2019s fertility declined very substantially after 1970, attaining levels that are unusually low for a poor agrarian society, although not quite dropping to replacement level. As Figure 2 shows, China\u2019s total fertility rate fell from close to six around 1970 to only 2.7\u20132.8 at the end of the decade. Thus, at least 70 per cent of the decline in fertility from 1970 up to the present was achieved prior to the launching of the one-child policy, not afterward. (Note that, in their article, Wei and Zhang show that a similarly dramatic drop in fertility occurred in Yicheng, as well as in Shanxi Province generally, prior to the launching of the one-child policy, rather than following that launch\u2014see their Figure 3, p. 113.) Although economic modernization and the increased availability of contraceptives contributed somewhat to the sharp fertility decline prior to 1980, particularly in urban areas, there can be no doubt that coercive enforcement of state-mandated limits on births played the dominant role.20

If China\u2019s rate of population growth was already sharply reduced by stricter birth planning enforcement in the 1970s, why was the even more coercive one-child policy launched, starting in 1980?21 The answer to this puzzle is already available in prior research, including Susan Greenhalgh\u2019s 2008 book, Just One Child: Science and Policy in Deng\u2019s China, and more recently Liang Zhongtang\u2019s 2014 book, History of China\u2019s Birth Planning Policy.22 Briefly, the urgent search by Deng and other post-Mao leaders to find any conceivable way to increase the per capita economic growth rate led to a strong desire among the Party leadership for a birth-control program that was even more restrictive than in the 1970s. Already in 1978, the Chinese leadership began contemplating the need for a one-child policy.23 Even more ambitious official fertility control targets found a ready and purportedly scientific rationale after 1979 in demographic projections produced by a small group of scientists headed by Song Jian, who were influenced by the Club of Rome\u2019s Limits to Growth and other Western doomsday writings in the 1970s.24 At a time when the country\u2019s population was already approaching 1 billion (the 1982 census counted 1.008 billion Chinese), they asserted that it was necessary for China to reach zero population growth as rapidly as possible. They also claimed that China\u2019s optimal population ca. 2080 was 700 million or less, and that only a total fertility rate of closer to one rather than two or higher would enable China to reach this long-run optimal population. Their pseudo-scientific claims and projections, based upon ideas that have since been widely criticized and largely discredited in the West, offered a scientific-sounding justification for China\u2019s even more draconian one-child policy.25

The trend data in Figure 2 also make it clear that the launching of the one-child policy was not followed by a sustained further decline in fertility. Rather, after an initial drop in 1980, China\u2019s overall fertility rebounded upward and then fluctuated for most of the rest of the decade. So, despite the massive increase in coercive enforcement that the new policy precipitated (1983 was a particularly dreadful year\u2014China performed 14.4 million abortions, 20.7 million sterilizations and 17.8 million IUD insertions that year; see Figure 1), China did not initially have much success in producing a further decline in fertility.26

A further sustained decline in China\u2019s fertility to sub-replacement levels began only toward the end of the 1980s, as shown in Figure 2. Some of this further decline can be attributed to a change in the system of enforcement. Instead of the primary burden for enforcement falling on grass-roots birth planning workers, most of them middle-aged women, major responsibility shifted to more powerful actors\u2014local Party secretaries and other officials (overwhelmingly men). Achieving success in keeping the number of births down became one of the key criteria used in the annual performance ratings of local officials. Under the \u201cone-veto rule\u201d, an official who failed to meet birth-control targets in his locality could be denied promotion or even lose his post, even if the local performance was acceptable regarding economic growth and other evaluation criteria. (The new rule\u2019s initial effect can be seen in the spikes in birth-control operations in 1991 shown in Figure 1.) Still, it would be highly misleading to attribute the attainment and maintenance of sub-replacement fertility or even the overall trend toward lower fertility since 1970 solely to the post-1980 policy or to China\u2019s coercive birth planning enforcement. This brings us to the final myth that needs to be challenged\u2014the claim that the one-child policy is responsible for preventing 400 million excess births, producing manifold benefits for China and for the rest of the world.#Did the One-Child Policy Prevent 400 Million Births?

Of all the myths that have circulated regarding the one-child policy, the one that has gained the most currency recently is that it has prevented 400 million births. Supporters of the policy argue that such a huge number of prevented births not only fueled China\u2019s dramatic post-1978 economic boom, as claimed by the Chinese government, but also contributed to global well-being.27 For example, a 20 September 2014 special report in The Economist on global efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions ranks China\u2019s one-child policy as the fourth most important policy or action contributing toward this goal in recent decades, after the Montreal Protocol, worldwide use of hydroelectric power and the spread of nuclear power. The one-child policy is credited with producing a cumulative reduction of 1.3 billion tons of carbon emissions in China as of 2005.28

It is already clear from our discussion above that most of China\u2019s fertility decline cannot be attributed to the one-child policy, since the decline largely occurred prior to the policy\u2019s launch. How was the number of 400 million generated, and how credible is it? Our research reveals that the original calculation of the number of births prevented came from an internal study sponsored by China\u2019s National Population and Birth Planning Commission in the late 1990s, a study which was based on overly simplistic and unrealistic assumptions.29 This \u201cnumber of births prevented\u201d claim has subsequently been utilized by Chinese government officials to showcase the success of China\u2019s birth-control program.

The estimate of the number of prevented births was based on a study whose results are displayed in Figure 3. Basically, the report used a straight line to portray the overall fertility trend between 1950 and 1970 based on adjusted crude birth rates, and then simply extrapolated this line forward into later years, based upon the (mistaken) assumption that this extrapolation provided an accurate projection of what China\u2019s fertility would have been in the absence of birth planning campaigns.30 The report\u2019s projected crude birth rate for China in 1990 was 29.71 per thousand, and for 1998 28.43 per thousand, as shown in the top line in Figure 3. By comparing the births that would have occurred under this scenario and the observed actual birth rates (shown as the bottom line in Figure 3), the report\u2019s authors arrived at their estimate of the cumulative number of births \u201cprevented\u201d. For the period between 1970 and 1998, they concluded that this number was 338 million. In the decade after this study, not only was the starting date conveniently shifted forward from 1970 to 1980 (thus redirecting attention to the one-child policy), but also the number of births prevented was inflated to 400 million.

The claim that China\u2019s one-child policy prevented 400 million births contains at least three fatal flaws. First, the number is based on a \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario that is completely unrealistic. The projected trajectory of crude birth rates, as shown by the top line in Figure 3, severely underestimates the decline in fertility that would have occurred in the absence of China\u2019s birth-control programs. This problem can be seen by comparing China with the real experiences of countries that had birth rates similar to China\u2019s in the 1970s but did not have mandatory birth-control programs. The middle line of Figure 3 shows this comparison. There were 16 countries in 1970 with a population of a million or more that had crude birth rates of between 30 and 38 per thousand, with an average crude birth rate of 35.55 per thousand, slightly above China\u2019s level at the time, which was 33.43 per thousand.31 In the years after 1970, the average birth rate of these 16 countries declined to 26.6 per thousand by 1990, and to 21.96 by 1998, significantly below the predicted values of the \u201cChina births prevented\u201d estimate. By predicting a birth rate that is unrealistically high\u201417 per cent higher than the average of the comparison group as of 1990, 29 per cent higher in 1998, and as much as 45 per cent higher in 2005\u2014the estimate of total births prevented is clearly a wild exaggeration.

The second fatal flaw with the simplistic \u201cbirths prevented\u201d estimate is its neglect of a particular feature of China\u2019s process of fertility decline, namely, that the major part of the fertility decline occurred in the 1970s, prior to the one-child policy. The drastic pre-1980 decline in China\u2019s actual birth rates, as shown in the bottom line of Figure 3, had far-reaching consequences. The contraception, abortion and sterilization campaigns that resulted in the rapid decline in the birth rate during the 1970s had long-lasting effects well beyond that decade. The smaller birth cohorts of the 1970s that resulted from this decline laid the foundation for smaller numbers of births 20 years later and beyond, when those smaller birth cohorts entered reproductive ages.

The third fatal problem with the \u201c400 million births prevented\u201d claim is that it totally ignores the most significant source of fertility decline worldwide: economic development. As the popular slogan has it, \u201ceconomic development is the best contraceptive\u201d. China\u2019s dramatic post-1978 economic boom and the profound social changes unleashed by rising incomes and levels of education and rapid urbanization would have driven down birth rates even in the absence of state birth planning campaigns. Given the much more rapid pace of economic and social change in China than in any of the 16 comparison countries used in Figure 3, it is highly likely that the trajectory of birth rate decline in China after 1980 due to this source alone would have been steeper than the average for the 16 comparison countries, and therefore even closer to the observed birth rate changes, as shown in the bottom line in Figure 3. In sum, the claim that China\u2019s one-child policy prevented 400 million births is entirely bogus. While the earlier \u201clater, longer, fewer\u201d mandatory birth planning campaign launched under Mao Zedong did drive China\u2019s fertility levels down to levels below what would be expected for a country at China\u2019s economic development level at that time, in the period since 1980 it is debatable how much of China\u2019s further fertility decline can be attributed to the one-child policy.32We conclude by offering our own summary of the historical record to replace the myths with which we began:

1. Despite Mao Zedong\u2019s earlier declarations that a large and rapidly growing population was not a problem for China, he was still in charge when a dramatic shift from voluntary to mandatory birth planning occurred after 1970. Birth planning was already being coercively enforced during the 1970s under the \u201clater, longer, fewer\u201d campaign, prior to the launching of the one-child policy in 1980.

2. Rather than continuing to experience out-of-control population growth, China during the 1970s recorded a dramatic decline in fertility rates, with the bulk of the decline in fertility from 1970 to the present achieved in that decade. Birth-control programs in the 1970s cannot be portrayed as voluntary, as they relied on mass campaigns and heavy coercion in order to try to meet government birth-limitation targets.

3. The even more coercive one-child campaign was based on politics and pseudo-science, rather than on necessity, much less on good demography. China could have achieved further progress in lowering fertility with some version of a two-child policy, a choice that would have sharply reduced the human suffering caused after 1980. Despite the widespread coercion and abuses connected to the new policy, it was not in fact very successful initially in reducing fertility levels further. Fertility rates fluctuated through most of the 1980s and only resumed their decline toward today\u2019s sub-replacement levels at the end of the decade.

4. While a substantial portion of China\u2019s dramatic decline in fertility rates since 1970 can be attributed to the implementation of mandatory birth control, it is highly misleading to claim that the one-child policy successfully prevented 400 million extra births.33 Despite the coercive ferocity of the campaign, China\u2019s rapid economic development since 1980 deserves the lion\u2019s share of the credit for the (much more modest) numbers of reduced births that have occurred as the country\u2019s total fertility rate further declined, from about 2.7\u20132.8 at the end of the 1970s to perhaps 1.4\u20131.5 today. It is a damning indictment of the Chinese record that all of her Confucian neighbors in East Asia achieved rapid declines to their present sub-replacement fertility rates via robust economic growth supplemented by voluntary birth planning campaigns, thus avoiding the massive abuses that China\u2019s misguided launching of the one-child program produced.#Notes

1 The Chinese term jihua shengyu is usually translated as \u201cfamily planning\u201d in Chinese government publications, including when referring to the names of government agencies responsible for this task. However, since the term \u201cfamily planning\u201d is understood outside China to refer to a variety of practices that help families to meet their own childbearing goals, while the Chinese practices involved are decidedly different\u2014state interventions to limit the numbers of births\u2014we will throughout instead use the terms \u201cbirth planning\u201d or \u201cbirth limits\u201d.

2 The partial relaxation involves couples where one spouse is an only child and the other spouse has siblings. Such couples are now allowed to have two children. (Couples where both spouses are single children have been allowed to have two children since the policy was launched in 1980.) While the symbolic importance of this relaxation may be important, the actual demographic effect is likely to be quite minor. See Martin King Whyte, \u201cModifying China\u2019s One-Child Policy\u201d, published online in E-International Relations (2 February 2014), http://www.e-ir.info/2014/02/02/modifying-chinas-one-child-policy/, accessed 2 February 2015. At the time of writing, the one-child policy remains very much in effect, although we note long-standing exceptions to the one-child limit later in this article.

Freeberne discusses the controversy surrounding the role of Peking University president Ma Yinchu in advocating birth planning in 1957. Later accounts have suggested that Mao was critical of Ma\u2019s advocacy of birth control, and that in the anti-rightist campaign Ma was criticized and then fired from his presidency, thus silencing a voice that could have helped to slow China\u2019s population growth much earlier. See, for example, \u201cCuopi yiren, duosheng sanyi\u201d (One Individual Wrongly Criticized, Three Hundred Million More Births), Guangming ribao (Guangming Daily) (5 August 1979), p. 3. However, Ma\u2019s statements on the need for birth planning very much echoed Mao\u2019s own statements from 1957 quoted above, he was never condemned as a rightist, and when he left the presidency in 1960 he was already 78 years old. Furthermore, voluntary birth planning efforts resumed and were expanded in the early 1960s, as Freeberne documents. The claim that Ma\u2019s treatment led to the demise of Chinese birth planning efforts until 1980 thus also belongs in the category of myth.

16 In the interviews which Martin Whyte and William Parish conducted in Hong Kong in 1972\u201374 with former residents of Guangdong villages, the early stages of this stricter birth planning enforcement were described. William Parish and Martin King Whyte, Village and Family in Contemporary China (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978), pp. 138\u201354. Similarly, former residents of a variety of cities whom Whyte and Parish interviewed in Hong Kong in 1977\u201378 provided details on the enforcement of the \u201clater, longer, fewer\u201d program in urban China during that period. See Martin King Whyte and William Parish, Urban Life in Contemporary China (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984), particularly pp. 160\u201361.

17 See the translation of one such form used in the early 1970s, in William Parish and Martin King Whyte, Village and Family in Contemporary China, p. 143. Almost two decades earlier, when China\u2019s first voluntary birth planning campaign was being launched during the mid-1950s, a resident French journalist presciently observed, \u201cI seriously think that this regime is probably the first in history which could officially adopt birth control as a compulsory measure, and make sure that its orders will be universally obeyed \u2026 And who will control the birth control? Quite simple: the street committee. It will fix the quotas, give advice, and keep an eye on married couples.\u201d Robert Guillain, 600 Million Chinese (New York: Criterion Books, 1957), p. 295. While obedience was far from universal after 1970, the CCP\u2019s grass-roots control structures made it possible to contemplate enforcing mandatory birth planning.

18 Steven Mosher, Broken Earth: The Rural Chinese (New York: The Free Press, 1983), Chapter 9. Mosher reports that \u201chigh tides\u201d of birth planning enforcement occurred regularly after 1978 in his village.

19 Evan Osnos, \u201cAbortion and Politics in China\u201d, The New Yorker (15 June 2012), available at http://www.newyorker.com/news/evan-osnos/abortion-and-politics-in-china, last accessed 2 February 2015. In Feng\u2019s case, injections rather than surgery were used to abort her seven-month fetus, and pictures which a relative took of the mother in the hospital lying beside her stillborn daughter were widely circulated.

20 See the discussion in Arthur Wolf, \u201cThe Preeminent Role of Government Intervention in China\u2019s Family Revolution\u201d, Population and Development Review, Vol. 12 (1986), pp. 101\u201316.21 Initially in 1980 there were efforts to promote a limit of one birth for all Han Chinese, although not for ethnic minorities. However, the difficulties of enforcing a one-child limit, particularly in the countryside, led to a compromise rule being applied in most rural areas from 1984 to the present (following the 1983 peak of coercive enforcement, as shown in Figure 1). The most common formula is a \u201c1.5-children rule\u201d: if the first-born child is a son, the couple is supposed to stop, but if it is a daughter they are allowed to have one more child, after which they should stop (even if the second child is also a daughter). However, in two populous provinces, Jiangsu and Sichuan, almost all residents, even in rural areas, are expected to obey the one-child limit. So, while it would be an oversimplification, or even another myth, to claim that China has adopted a one-child rule for everyone since 1980, nonetheless close to two-thirds of the population would end up having only one child if local regulations on birth limits as of the late 1990s were strictly obeyed by all. On the nature of local variations in birth limits across China and the proportion of the population falling under a one-child limit, see Gu Baochang, Wang Feng, Guo Zhigang and Zhang Erli, \u201cChina\u2019s Local and National Fertility Policies at the End of the Twentieth Century\u201d, Population and Development Review, Vol. 33 (2007), pp. 129\u201347.

23 The historical record is still unclear about the decision-making process lying behind the one-child policy. Chen Muhua, who was newly charged with developing an even more restrictive fertility regime, played a critical role in pushing for a one-child policy. It is reasonable to assume that she had strong support from leaders such as Hua Guofeng and Deng Xiaoping.

24 Donella H. Meadows, Dennis L. Meadows, J\u00f8rgen Randers and William W. Behrens III, The Limits to Growth: A Report for the Club of Rome\u2019s Project on the Predicament of Mankind (New York: Universe Books, 1972). Song Jian was a former rocket scientist who rose to become a State Councilor, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and President of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In the late 1970s, he became centrally involved in making demographic projections, using his access to computers and his political connections to increasingly dominate debates among professional demographers about China\u2019s population policy, as described by Greenhalgh and Liang.

25 See the details provided in Susan Greenhalgh, Just One Child, particularly p. 158. For one biting critique of the Club of Rome projections, see Julian Simon, The Ultimate Resource (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981). Past research also shows that China could have approached or reached replacement level fertility with a further implementation of a \u201ctwo children with spacing\u201d requirement, rather than the more drastic one-child limit that became official policy. John Bongaarts and Susan Greenhalgh, \u201cAn Alternative to the One-Child Policy in China\u201d, Population and Development Review, Vol. 11 (1985), pp. 585\u2013617.

26 The rebound in fertility in 1981 and 1982 was partly a result of a sharp reduction in the average age of first marriage in China after 1980. After the launching of the one-child policy, with its overwhelming emphasis on fertility reduction, the \u201clater\u201d part of the 1970s birth planning campaign was neglected. Simultaneously in 1980 a revision of the Marriage Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China was promulgated. While on the surface it appeared that the 1980 revision required higher minimum ages of marriage than the original 1950 Marriage Law (20 for females and 22 for males, compared with 18 and 20 in the 1950 version), the actual effect was to make it easier for couples and their parents to demand to have marriages registered at ages younger than the \u201clate marriage\u201d ages of the 1970s campaign. Nationally, the mean age of first marriage for both males and females dropped by about 2 full years after 1980 and only gradually started increasing after that, with marriage ages in 1990 still younger than in 1980 (Deborah Davis and Sara Friedman [eds], Wives, Husbands, and Lovers: Marriage and Sexuality in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Urban China [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2014], Table 1.1, p. 7.) Marriage age reduction was responsible for at least 16 per cent of the rise in fertility in 1981 (Griffith Feeney, Wang Feng, Mingkun Zhou and Baoyu Xiao, \u201cRecent Fertility Dynamics in China: Results from the 1987 One Percent Population Survey\u201d, Population and Development Review, Vol. 15 [1989], pp. 297\u2013322).

27 Critics of the policy also cite the estimate of 400 million births prevented. See, for example, http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/400-million-lives-prevented-through-one-child-policy-chinese-official-says, last accessed 5 February 2015.

28 http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21618680-our-guide-actions-have-done-most-slow-global-warming-deepest-cuts, last accessed 5 February 2015. The Economist cites a statement by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman in 2007 as the basis for the specific carbon emissions reduction estimate (which was based on a more modest figure at that time of 300 million births prevented).

29 Wang Feng and Cai Yong, \u201cSiyi Zhongguoren shi zenmo shaoshengde?\u201d (Did China\u2019s One-Child Policy Prevent 400 Million Births in the Last 30 Years?), Zhongguo gaige (China Reform), Vol. 7 (2010), pp. 85\u201388; Wang Feng, Yong Cai and Baochang Gu, \u201cPopulation, Policy, and Politics\u201d.

30 According to official statistics, China\u2019s crude birth rate in 1950 was 37.0 per thousand, and in 1970 it was 33.4 per thousand.

31 The 16 countries are Albania, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Jamaica, North Korea, South Korea, Lebanon, Malaysia, Panama, Paraguay, South Africa, Thailand, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Venezuela. (Sri Lanka also qualified, with a crude birth rate of 30.9 and a population of 12 million in 1970, but it was excluded from the study because data were missing for 1998.)

32 Yong Cai, \u201cChina\u2019s Below-Replacement Fertility: Government Policy or Socioeconomic Development?\u201d, Population and Development Review, Vol. 36 (2010), pp. 419\u201340.

33 Even if one uses a lower and more realistic estimate of the reduction in the number of births that can be attributed to coercive birth planning since 1970, the claim that China has benefited greatly as a result is yet another myth. Such a claim ignores the very serious problems that China is now facing as a result of its peculiar demographic history, including a rapidly aging population, rising labor costs and a highly distorted sex ratio. See the discussion in Wang Feng, Yong Cai and Baochang Gu, \u201cPopulation, Policy, and Politics\u201d.I hope this isn't your bachelor's thesis topic.

I present a legitimate point of view about UChicago. I thought you belonged to a community that values rigorous critical thinking and debate. Why do UChicago people bristle when I discuss UChicago's troubling relationship with the surrounding community, whether it's redlining in the 60s, or the latent racism of present day students?
I don't care that my audience is small right now. It grows with time. More importantly, this subreddit becomes a running catalogue of where the university falls short. Each week, the indictment becomes a little longer.
UChicago makes people's lives bleak. If at least one person decides not to attend because of me, this endeavor will be a success.
I have devoted years to raising these issues about UChicago. I imagine I will be at it for the rest of my life. I'm not going anywhere.

TOP FUCKING KEKLOL quit it. You just refuse to believe someone you disagree with is not actually dumb eh? Have fun in high school.

I got 2300+ for the SATs and my family has no connection with that university.

My GPA is 3.5

I'm not going to show more because I have already shown enough and you aren't willing to just admit that I'm not dumb.

You should probably just recognize that *gasp* people can hold different opinions without being dumb!

Maybe you should continue your ad hominem tirades elsewhere. I'm not interested in rebuking you any further.In my experience the frequency of this occurring in Chinese circles is higher than that of in Western circles.The notification is fired based on local calculations. If you disconnect from the internet you may still see that notif.No I'm not saying that. If you disconnect from a network, the app stills pushes a notification, meaning that the troop finish notification is done *locally* and not pushed by the server, which implies that the timing of the troop finish notification is calculated locally. This means that if there are any errors, it would most likely be client side.I do read Fox News site comments. I've also read death threats (not to me) made by random people on the Internet. I'm still convinced that this is worse in China.In my university, 3.5 GPA is a high GPA (3.2 is the Dean's List cutoff) because the classes here are difficult. I knew you are going to say that, because well, you are in a high school where people have lower standards than in colleges, so they give As out pretty freely. That you didn't think a 3.5 GPA is high at my university just shows how little you know.

20k DE is achievable by anyone with two hours of free time.

Also the maximum GPA is 4.0 and no one achieves that. Only high schools use inflated GPAs to boost students' ego; no wonder you have such a huge one even after being proven wrong.Ignore OP. He always does this.Kid, I'm in a *college*, not a *high school*. There is no inflated GPA here. Honors classes do not inflate GPA in college. College =/= High school, kiddo. The maximum GPA is 4.0, which no one hits unless you take easy classes all the way. Average GPA here is 3.1. Your limited high school worldview cannot be applied onto college levels.

You spend 6 minutes searching and raiding per raid. Each raid should bring you 700 DE. 20 raids = 2 hours = 14,000 DE. You'd probably lose around 3000 DE if you don't use a clan guard.

2 hours every day within three days should net you over 20,000 DE if you're capable. Three days is already a grand concession.

BTW, high school honors classes and AP courses are pathetically easy compared to what people do in college.No because I don't screenshot my raids and I have no need to farm DE right now.

I will post that question on this sub right now to show you that people agree it is possible.I maxed my hogs and BK to Lv 5 two weeks ago and I no longer raid for DE.In other news, porn industry is flooded with a new wave of secret cam videos.It's not entirely unbelievable (**taking into consideration that rankings do not reflect whether a student will learn well there**). I say this as a guy who has a vested interested in seeing Tsinghua *not* outcompete American schools (I need to get a job). Tsinghua receives enormous funding for engineering from the government, has a top-of-the-crop cohort each year, and has a narrow focus on engineering due to university restructuring during early Communist era, where the Chinese emulated the Soviet style of higher education.

The methodology of the rankings is important, and in this case, you need to understand that Chinese engineering PhDs and professors frequently spam low quality published works, therefore distorting Tsinghua's scores. Regardless, Tsinghua is an extremely good engineering school.

Furthermore, within China, Tsinghua's papers are frequently cited since they're the best school anyways.Did I say you can't max DE upgrades with barch? Perhaps you should read the post more carefully.

It is harder to raid DE with barch than something like GiBarch. Do you disagree with this?I don't use Clan Guard, and I only lose at most 3k DE in a day at max storage level. Without Clan Guard this is still perfectly achievable.Why would I contradict myself by raiding DE that I no longer need? I'm barely raiding now since the last of my upgrades are all cheap gold upgrades and my CC war loot is sufficient.

I'm not going to raid DE just to show you that it's possible. I have wasted enough time on you. You are a real silly individual who tries to put down others for no reason. Grow up.Maybe you should read more carefully because I'm clearly not saying Barch won't net any DE. I'm saying you won't be successful at raiding DE if you use Barch. Unless you define 400 DE per raid as "successful"I'm talking about TH7 and not TH8. GiBarch is far superior than Barch for DE raiding.Or you could try to be successful at DE raiding and finish all TH7 DE upgrades within 2 weeks.Which means you could ignore DE for the rest of TH7 and not worry about DE lossLook at the Asian supremacist sternly warning people not to hold western supremacist viewpoints! You said it, bro!The conclusion provides a meaningful enough gist if you don't have the timeYou can edit your flair on the sidebar of the subreddit.

http://puu.sh/kBfTV.pngElixir and gold costs at TH7 are low enough to not matter. You get 600k gold and 600k elixir every 2 days from war. With 17 raids of only DE you're going to be able to cover 2 days worth of gold and elixir needs anyways.&gt; We don\u2019t want to be associated with any fighting or killing.

I don't like to stereotype, butIndeed. That's why I don't look at rankings anymore (my parents still do though). I find that the quality of an institution is only very loosely correlated to its ranking.Oh, and some great insight on Quora:

https://www.quora.com/Is-it-stupid-for-USNews-to-rank-Chinas-Tsinghua-University-as-the-second-best-engineering-university-in-the-world-only-after-MIT

&gt; Yes and no. 

&gt; Compared to the US standards, where research and papers mean everything, it is definitely up there. Being a current student, I can tell you that everyone here is obsessed about publications.

&gt; But on the other hand, if you consider a top university to provide top class "education" and "teaching", then I would go as far as to say it is not even in the top 20. The courses are either too easy or too difficult with nothing in middle, which makes it horrible for education. It isn't really personalized enough.

Interestingly, we have a transfer student from Tsinghua and I asked him to describe the culture with one word. He answered "\u6d6e\u8e81". The professors there do not really understand how to educate, and the head of computer science, which won the Turing Award, fucked up the curriculum there due to making it too theoretical and too research-heavy and inaccessible to undergrads.Rankings are really not indicative of much else other than prestige once you get to the top 30s IMHO. Colleges game the system extensively (my college spammed advertisement all over the place in order to increase the amount of people applying, and spammed really "cool" welcome letters to increase yield) to increase their rankings, while not necessarily being much better than other colleges.too many gays due to too little womenOh man, I love talking to native Chinese people.

LOL you sold out yourself.After some quick googling (feel free to chime in if I've missed something major) it looks like a combo of the following:

1. The traffic volume at the time of the incident was 60% more than the design capacity. They were building a rail line to fix it but it was still about two years away from completed. The road was already stupid slow.

2. They'd recently opened a bunch of (possibly illegal?) coal mines in Inner Mongolia, and were using trucks to get the coal from there to Beijing. Apart from the increase in congestion, that involved a lot of stopping to check loads and paperwork. The trucks that used 110 refused to exit and use another route, because they'd be subject to more checks on every other road, generally involving bribes that cut into their pay.

3. Some genius then decided to go ahead with road maintenance, which knocked out 50% of the road.

4. A bunch of people then began to abandon their cars (fair enough) or run out of fuel (didn't turn off their cars between periods of movement, were low on fuel already, or used the air con too much), or they had shitty cars that couldn't handle stop-starting that long so they broke down... And a number of collisions caused by people trying to sneak ahead a little in line. Not many actual fights though, which is interesting.

Amount of people in outer lanes who were able (and also willing) to give up and exit the highway was less than the amount of new traffic pouring in every hour, so it got worse and worse. And so, ten day jam.

PS. I said "Can you not be so autistic" to a friendSomehow they managed to link two rather irrelevant topics into a single article.

Refugees shouldn't go to Asia in general. Japan is extremely homogeneous, China has a shitty quality of life, Singapore is too elitist, etc. Even in HK and Singapore, the supposed enlightened Western-style cities, do you rarely see people readily welcoming refugees. At least in HK, aid to refugees is direly lacking and simply incompetent.

Chinese people emigrating is also due to China being a shithole.

But what do these two points have in common...Chinese ISP engineers fucking up something again probably.Peking University **is shit** in engineering.

#The concept of \u201cscience\u201d in modern Chinese thought

***Wang Hui***


---

#Abstract

This paper investigates the formation of the concept of science in modern Chinese thought from four perspectives. The first aspect concentrates on the Japanese origin of the concept of science, analyzing this concept through the formation of the late Qing branches of learning, fenke zhixue, and the knowledge system of positivism. The second aspect takes gezhi (investigating things and extending knowledge), qiongli (exhaustion of principle) and other concepts as clues and analyzes the relationship between the concepts of modern science and the study of the school of principle lixue to show the breakdown and connection between scientific concepts fused in the three aspects of nature, morality and politics and the Confucian world view. The third aspect takes as its focus the systematization of scientific research, analyzing the agencies of science, scientific publications and the scientific community's formation and the influence of these elements on society and culture. The fourth aspect takes the May Fourth debate on East\u2013West notions of civilization and the debate on science and metaphysics as its focus, discussing scientific language, the debate between civilizations and the formation of the fields of humanities and social sciences.#I. \u201cBranches of learning,\u201d positivism and social models

The word science (kexue) was one of the most widely used keywords in twentieth century China. Its earliest source comes from the Japanese Meiji scholar Nishi Amane (1829\u20131897) who in 1874 in the Meiroku zasshi [Meiroku Journal] translated the English word \u201cscience\u201d using the Chinese characters for kexue. Nishi was deeply influenced by the positivist philosophy of August Comte and John Stuart Mills, and the term kexue was produced under the influence of Comte's \u201cbranches of learning.\u201d While translating and introducing an English encyclopedia, Nishi noted:

&gt; August Comte's evidence for the classification of fields of study goes from the simple to the complex, establishing five models of study (astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, sociology), his theory is most excellent, his discernment most grand, this can be said to be complete\u2026 1

Besides defining knowledge according to Comte's notion of a five-branch classification, Nishi particularly promoted Comte's positivism and Mill's method of induction, recognizing that positivism and inductive logic could be applied to a variety of fields. Besides the natural sciences, the fields also included religion, morality, art and society \u2013 together providing a universal method that was generally applicable. In the Japanese Encyclopedia Hyakugaku renkan [The Links of a Hundred Sciences], he distinguishes between scientific research as a \u201cstudy\u201d and the technical application as a \u201ctechnique,\u201d and at the same time he indicates that \u201cthat which is called science (kexue), has two elements (referring to \u201cstudy\u201d and \u201ctechnique\u201d \u2013 author's note) intertwined together, which cannot be decisively separated.\u201d 2 In his youth, Nishi received a strict Confucian education, and so when he translated Western learning he made use of the Confucian categories; for example he translated \u201cphilosophy\u201d respectively as the \u201cstudy of nature and principle,\u201d \u201cstudy of principle,\u201d \u201cstudy of exhausting principle,\u201d \u201cstudy of the strivings of the wise,\u201d \u201cstudy of strivings for wisdom\u201d and finally he settled upon the \u201cstudy of wisdom\u201d (zhexue). The opening argument of \u201cT\u00f4itsukan\u201d [Unified Vision], the first part of \u201cSh\u014dhaku sakki\u201d [Sundry Notes of Sh\u014dhaku], states: \u201cAll of the sciences and techniques have one thread running through them, which is very critical,\u201d because having established a unified outlook in study and technique, people's activities can be organized, society's order can be stabilized, family and state can become powerful and rich and study typifies the superior man, thus \u201cestablishing a unified outlook and exhausting the subtleties of study and technique.\u201d But one man cannot do all of this, \u201ctherefore for establishing a unified outlook, it is the philosopher's role to construct discussion and explication, whereas to exhaust the subtleties of a particular study and technique, this function belongs to the expert in that field.\u201d 3

In a manner similar to early Meiji Japan, during the late Qing dynasty, \u201cscience\u201d (kexue), \u201cvarious studies\u201d (zhuxue) and other concepts that indicated fields of knowledge were related to Western knowledge or Western studies, and these specialist fields of knowledge had been introduced for the purpose of political reform and self-strengthening. Therefore, the use of scientific terms and the translation of Western knowledge had a very close relationship. Kang Youwei said:

&gt; Now if China today does not reform it will not be able renew itself, for to change a little but not completely is not possible, to change completely but not to permit the study of agriculture, industry, commerce or mining is not possible, if you want to open up the study of agriculture, industry, commerce and mining, not allowing scholars to penetrate to the principle of things is not possible. For all of these various studies, China does not have books, and must wait for scholars to know western languages and then study these. It takes seven years to thoroughly understand a Western language, how could scholars thoroughly understand their studies [without the seven years of study]? If you do not want to learn their languages to penetrate their studies, you will have to have their books translated, the twenty provinces must start to translate those books. 4

In 1890, when Chinese scholars began to use the word \u201ckexue\u201d (science), its direct source was from a Japanese catalogue. For example, in the spring of 1898 Kang Youwei edited the Catalogue of Japanese Books published by the Datong Translation Bureau. In the second volume under \u201cSchool of Principle\u201d there are the following listings: \u201cKagaku nyumon\u201d [Introduction to Science], volume one, translated by Fukyusha, price three jiao five fen; \u201cKagaku no genri\u201d [Principles of Science], volume one, author Motomura Shunkichi, price five jiao five fen; and other items. Science here refers to a physical-centered knowledge of nature. But at the same time there are examples such as \u201cScientific (like) Teaching methods,\u201d \u201cAnnals of Science (like)\u201d and \u201cAbstracts of Science (like),\u201d with the term \u201clike\u201d (science) being used much more broadly than \u201ckexue.\u201d 5 The drafting of the manuscript for the Catalogue began in 1888, meaning that the choice of the word \u201ckexue\u201d probably took shape between 1888 and 1898. It is worth noting that the titles entered under \u201cSchool of Principle\u201d in the Catalogue of Japanese Books mostly included physics, chemistry, calendrics, meteorology, geography, mineralogy, biology, philosophy, religious studies, psychology, logic and morality. Among the other volumes were separately arranged categories for physiology, religion, history, politics, law, agriculture, industry, commerce, education, literature, linguistics, aesthetics, novels and military works; the divisions are not very strict, but it is truly categorized according to the nature and function of \u201cvarious studies.\u201d

In his preface to the Catalogue of Japanese Books, Kang Youwei used \u201czhuxue\u201d (various studies) to denote each particular field of study, getting even closer to the concept of \u201cscience\u201d as a classification of studies. According to the research of Wang Baoping, Kang's book took its origin from the T\u00f4ky\u00f4 Shoseki Shuppan Eigy\u00f4sha Kumiaiin shoseki s\u00f4mokuroku [The Sales Catalogue Edited and Published by the Tokyo Publishing House, 1893\u20131898] in the seventh month of the twenty-sixth year of the Meiji reign (1893). 6

In 1902, Liang Qichao in a note on \u201cThe Relation between Geography and Civilization\u201d defined science (kexue) in this way: \u201canything which becomes a field (ke) of study is called science (kexue), this is like \u2018investigating things and extending knowledge\u2019 (gezhi) and \u2018various studies (zhuxue)\u2019.\u200a\u201d 7 Here, the extent of a field of study is comparatively broader than the extent of \u201cgezhi,\u201d and the notion of \u201cvarious studies\u201d with the branches of learning as a pre-condition also has a relation to the late Qing educational system reform. In \u201cGeneral Discussion on Reform: On the Imperial Examination System,\u201d Liang Qichao proposed eliminating the Imperial exams and establishing new studies; he also proposed \u201cusing the method of the Han and Tang Dynasties to greatly establish many fields\u201d while the contents of \u201cthe numerous fields\u201d (zhuke) included \u201cone branch of explaining the classics,\u201d \u201cone branch of explaining mathematics,\u201d \u201cone branch of explaining law,\u201d \u201cone branch of exploring the unknown,\u201d \u201cone branch concerning the body,\u201d \u201cone branch concerning art\u201d (and explaining \u201cthe principle of the creation of the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge\u201d), \u201cone branch of research,\u201d \u201cone branch of explaining medicine,\u201d \u201cone branch of military sciences\u2026\u201d 8 In this meaning of classification, not only can we find some relation between \u201cnumerous fields (zhuke)\u201d and \u201cvarious studies (zhuxue),\u201d but also we can discover the opposition between the branch of learning as a new model for the education system and the imperial examination and its system of knowledge.At roughly the same time, Yan Fu in \u201cNote to National Economy: Part 1 (Incomplete Manuscript)\u201d also used science (kexue) as a term meaning classification and specialized knowledge, although the central discussion was on sociology (qunxue) and national economics (guojixue), which clearly went beyond the limit of natural knowledge. Yan quotes from an original article by Qi Chali, a lecturer at the College of Law in Paris, France:

&gt; Taking sociology as the outline, from which derive these subcategories: there is the study of civilizations (jiaohuaxue) or the transformation of human relations (fanlunxue), there are legal studies, there is national economics, there is political science, there is religious studies, there is linguistics. 9

Yan Fu adds in his note,

&gt; The reason history is not listed as a separate field, is because it has not become a field. There is sociology, then there is also the study of objects (gewu), both have histories. History records the facts, therefore what is seen in the world is recorded, thus it seeks to establish a universal principle by substituting inferences for causal laws, and for this reason it is not a specialized field of study.

Here sociology and the study of things are differentiated by putting them in different ranges of classifications of specialist studies and, at the same time, making them different from history, hinting that this will provide a foreshadowing of the separation of social sciences, natural sciences and humanities. At the end of the note, Yan speaks of \u201csociology having a universal principle (gongli), and this universal law must be self-confident, and from my perspective, moreover it acts by free will,\u201d and it is a further differentiation of the study of things and sociology; sociology's objective in research is people with free will, therefore there is a great difference from the study of the natural or material objective of the study of things. But Yan Fu believes that in the research of sociology, though the conditions exist whereby \u201cprayers are inefficacious, previous words are not proven,\u201d mainly it is because \u201cthe original cause cannot be obtained\u201d and \u201cone cannot say that human affairs are without cause and effect, and that science has no specialized field,\u201d 10 and so the field of human activity is brought into the range of scientific research. \u201cScience\u201d here is a system of knowledge that obtains universal law by being divided into branches and by using deductive or inductive methods; with the exception of history, its range includes various specialized fields of study concerning nature and society.

As with the difference of position in Nishi's \u201cphilosophy\u201d or \u201cunified vision\u201d with his \u201cscience of sciences,\u201d late Qing Chinese scholars were prone to use the concept of \u201cgroups\u201d (qun) and the category of \u201csociology\u201d to unify the fields of knowledge, thus placing the classification of the study of fields of knowledge within the frame of an ideal model of society. This pattern is derived from Comte and Herbert Spencer's sociology and the concept of the \u201cgroup\u201d in ancient Chinese thought, thus the branches of learning are closely related to the overall view of society, the universe and nature. This also implies that science and its system have a close relationship with the concept of a new social community. According to Confucian thought, the \u201cgroup\u201d is \u201cthe law under Heaven\u201d and \u201cthe common nature of all things,\u201d it involves \u201cnot studying but knowing, not worrying but being able to do,\u201d that is the principle (li) of nature and it is one with the principle of morality. 11 Because of this, the term \u201cvarious studies\u201d is not a mixed-up chaos of knowledge classification, but is directly connected with the technique (shu) of the \u201csociology\u201d of politics and education.

In the 1896 \u201cBibliography of Western Learning\u201d and his preface to it, Liang Qichao divided \u201cWestern learning\u201d into three categories: \u201cstudy\u201d (sound, optics, chemical and electrical), \u201cpolitics\u201d (political, legal and social\u2013economic systems) and \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d (newspapers, the investigation of things and travel writing), and recognized that:

&gt; In all cases governance is derived from the fields of learning, and governance cannot be separated from the fields of learning. If one does not understand the study of groups (qunxue), then one cannot form a field of study, if one does not know the ins and outs of governance, one cannot begin to govern, therefore, whatever the branch of learning or governance, they cannot be separated. 12

This type of structure, the \u201cvarious studies\u201d classification, is similar to government, education and art in Confucian knowledge in that they have both similarities and differences, but is not the same as the Confucian discipline of knowledge; this not so strict division of subjects is arranged according the principle of proof of evidence. For Liang Qichao the structure of government, education and the arts is:

&gt; First vague then solid, because the study of form and substance, all arise from without form and without substance. That is why mathematics and mechanics are first; electricity, chemistry, sound, optics, oil are secondary; heaven, earth, man, things follow this; medicine and charts all belong to human affairs, and so they are placed at the end. For Western governments, communicating with their neighbors is the top priority, that is why histories are at the top, officially managed schools arise as to the form of government. Therefore, using international law to govern the world follows, and then being able to become rich and then later to become strong, thereafter agriculture, mining, industry and commerce follow this and the army is placed at the end here\u2026 13

The general outlook of science embodies the modern state's politics, the ethical and technical structure in an organic whole. Following Spencer's concepts in sociology, Yan Fu used the structure of heaven, earth and man to establish a system of knowledge related to nature, society and morality, and in this discipline the highest position is \u201cmetaphysics\u201d or the study of \u201crefining the mind and controlling affairs,\u201d situated at the bottom is mathematics, chemistry, electricity and botany, belonging to the middle level is agriculture, military science, navigation, mechanics, medicine and mining. This system of scientific knowledge is closely related to the empirical social model structure. Yan Fu describes Western society, from its lowest class levels and method of production to the highest level of the national system:

&gt; Everything originated from various studies and techniques, as for the studies of technologies, everything originated from the accurate measurement of things, applicable to all different classes, so as to set off on the utmost and essential path, thus if you disregard a thing there, and though you could sit and discuss it, it is not as good as one who acts upon it. 14

In reality, Yan Fu's \u201cmetaphysics\u201d (xuanxue) is closely connected to \u201csociology\u201d (qunxue), the former mainly includes mathematics and calculus, it is a type of knowledge which can comprehensively hold an object's \u201cprinciple of inevitability (biran zhi li),\u201d while the latter is capable of applying inductive and deductive methodology to politics, criminal law, finance and historiography and other fields of sociology. 15

&gt; What is sociology? Using the laws and regulations of science to investigate changes in society, and to understand the past and future. Why say this? Raise the objective and interest of the specialized study, exhaust what is offered by the investigation of the effects upon which it has been applied, and show the method by which the practicality has been governed. Thus the study of science includes this. Today as scholars doing their studies, how can they just use study to gain benefit and fortune and fish for name and fame? Therefore I combined the three elements: upright virtue, application and benefitting the masses into one. Sociology makes clear the governing and chaos, the rise and fall [of dynasties], the three elements are the fundamental reasons. 16

According to this understanding, using the methods of classification and primary evidence, science provided a new social model and a new principle of morality.#II. The school of principle roots of origins for gewu zhizhi (investigating things for ultimate knowledge) and the concepts of science

From the late Qing up to the May Fourth New Cultural Movement, \u201cscience\u201d was translated into Chinese in many ways, with kexue being one among them. Gezhixue, gewuxue, qionglixue, lixue, like and others were Chinese words that corresponded to \u201cscience\u201d and were widespread. They were approximately equivalent to the category of natural sciences. This kind of translation had its origins in missionary writings. The missionaries used Confucian terms to translate the Western concepts of science and technology, some examples include W.A.P. Martin's 1868 publication \u201cGewu rumen\u201d [Introduction to the Sciences], Alexander Williamson's 1876 publication \u201cGewu tanyuan\u201d [The Origin of Natural Science] and others. All used gewu as a translation of science. In 1874 the British consulate located in Shanghai proposed establishing the Gezhi shuyuan in the manner of a reading room. Afterwards on John Fryer's proposal and the board's approval, it was established as an industrial and technological school and a natural science research and educational institution. Its English name was The Chinese Polytechnic Institution and Reading Room. Fryer participated in the founding of the school as a member of the board of directors. On 9 February 1876, Fryer and Xu Shou established China's first scientific journal, Gezhi huibian [The Chinese Scientific Magazine], which included within its format serialized books, scientific essays, biographies, questions and answers on science, technological information and, in addition, published various information concerning natural sciences. It only ceased publication in 1892, after a total issue of 60 volumes, distributed through 51 national and international sales agents. In 1885, Fryer also established the Gezhi shushi [Chinese Scientific Book Depot], this being China's first specialized technical bookstore.

The use of gezhi, gewu and other concepts was not limited to missionary writing and practice, Chinese scholars and modern intellectuals also used these terms widely. Before 1902, the use of the word kexue was rare. For example in 1861, Feng Guifen initiated subjects in Western learning, \u201csuch as mathematics, mechanics, perspective, optics, chemistry, all of these concerning the investigation of things to reach the underlying basic principles (gewu zhili).\u201d 17 They did not mention the generic term kexue, but each subject belonging within the category of \u201cWestern studies.\u201d Even after 1902, gezhi and other terms were used alongside the term kexue. For example, Liang Qichao in 1902 had begun to use kexue, but in the same year he also published a work on the history of modern science with the title \u201cGezhixue yan'ge kaolue\u201d [Synopsis of the Vicissitudes in the History of Science]. Here everything that is referred to as gezhi includes all types of knowledge disciplines that take natural sciences as their focus. The term gezhi had both a broad and a narrow meaning. The broad meaning is almost equivalent to the concept of science itself. In 1895 Yan Fu in \u201cOn Power\u201d wrote:

&gt; When the study of science (gezhi zhixue) had not been put forward, narrow-mindedness had not yet been banished, restrained by [Confucian] education and detained in a corner. Troubling his heart and harming the government, wherever the narrow minded go, they will certainly lead their families and state astray. Therefore, if one wants to study sociology, one must first take-on various studies. If it were not for mathematics and names (ming\u2009=\u2009logic), then the intellect is not sufficiently developed to investigate the principle that does not escape, the fate that is inevitable; if not for the study of mechanics (strength) and the study of substances we would not know the mutual creation of cause-and-effect, effort and efficacy. Mechanics is what is called gezhi (investigation of things\u2009=\u2009science). The study of substances is what is called chemistry. Having already learned the four topics of logic, mathematics, chemistry and mechanics, then your mind will understand about the few but will be muddled about the many, observant of the near but confused with the distant. Thus without the three studies of heaven, earth and man, one will not be able to exhaust the long, broad and changing nature of principle. Among the three, the study of man is extremely urgent. 18

This first reference \u201cto investigate things to acquire knowledge\u201d (gezhi zhixue) cited in this passage refers to logic, mathematics, chemistry, mechanics and other \u201cvarious studies,\u201d but the next \u201cto investigate things to acquire knowledge\u201d specifically refers to mechanics, which is equivalent to the concept of science (gezhi) in the narrow meaning of its use. In 1900, the Commercial Press published a specialized scientific publication, namely the Yaquan School's edition of the Yaquan zazhi [Yaquan Magazine]. In the preface, the chief editor Du Yaquan spoke of the magazine's objectives: \u201cto publish scientific material on (gezhi), mathematics, chemistry, agriculture, commerce, industry, art, and all the sciences (kexue), its object is just that.\u201d 19 Here gezhi is listed together with mathematics, chemistry, commerce and arts and crafts, indicating the physical sciences. In his \u201cSynopsis of the Vicissitudes in the History of Science,\u201d Liang Qichao used the concept of gezhi to formulate each branch of learning at the same time, and he used gewu and qiongli to separately refer to the inductive and deductive scientific methods. Liang notes that

&gt; Bacon specifically advocates the theory of \u201cinvestigating things,\u201d insisting that principle must be based on physical observation and logical proof before one can believe a proposition. When Descartes again proposes the theory of \u201cexhausting principle,\u201d insisting that the discussion of studies must oppose all subjective feelings and personal belief, impartial investigation thus begins from this. 20

This passage also indicates that during this period the concepts of kexue and gezhi in regards to empirical methodology had close connections.

Beside the terms gezhi and gewu, during the late Qing and early Republican periods, popular Chinese translations for science also included \u201clixue\u201d (study of principle), \u201clike\u201d (field of principle), \u201cqionglixue\u201d (study of exhausting principle) and \u201cyishu\u201d (techniques of creation). For example, in the monthly Lixue zazhi [Study of Principle Magazine] published in Shanghai on 15 November 1906, chief editor Xue Zhelong used lixue as the title, the purpose being to strengthen and enrich China through popularizing science. Numbers seven, eight and nine of Yaquan zazhi serially published a \u201cCatalogue of Japanese Science (lixue), and Mathematics,\u201d listing 36 titles under the heading \u201cScience (lixue) in General,\u201d 64 titles under physics, 86 titles under chemistry, four titles under astronomy, seven titles under meteorology and 18 titles under natural sciences. Added to this were biology, anthropology, zoology, botany, geology, seismology, mineralogy, arithmetic, algebra, geometry and other sub-headings. The total listings under the heading of science numbered 377, and listings under the heading of mathematics came to 531. Besides math, other subjects were included in the category of science. 21 The journal Kexue shijie [Science World] in four consecutive issues published \u201cSheshuo \u2013 Views of the Publishing House\u201d; three issues dealt with science, and were titled like and lixue. 22 Du Yaquan used \u201cThe Relationship of Politics and Art\u201d as the title of an article in which \u201cpolitics\u201d referred to domestic governing and foreign relations, to military government, industry and commerce, academic atmosphere and the educational system and various fields of social life. The term \u201cart\u201d included \u201cthe methods of navigation,\u201d \u201cthe study of military weaponry,\u201d \u201csteam or electrical powered machinery,\u201d \u201cwood-block and lithographic printing\u201d and other fields of scientific technology and enterprise. Here, \u201cart\u201d does not imply a complete break from enterprise in order to form an independent concept, nor does it include a strict separation from scientific research and the technological fields.

\u201cInvestigating things\u201d (gezhi), \u201cexhausting principle\u201d (qiongli) and other terms all came from Confucianism, particularly from the Song\u2013Ming school of principle's discussion of \u201cthe study of things to acquire knowledge,\u201d but during the Ming and Qing eras this became connected with knowledge of nature. At the end of the Ming, Western missionaries while bringing in Christianity also brought in:

&gt; The discussion of matter for the purpose of serving Heaven and loving mankind, the theory on extending things by exhausting principle, the method of governing the world and pacifying all under heaven, all the way down to calendars and arithmetic, medicine, agriculture, and irrigation. 23In order for Chinese scholars to more easily accept Christianity, missionaries consciously used the tactics of \u201cmelding with Confucianism\u201d (heru), \u201csupplementing Confucianism\u201d (buru) and \u201csurpassing Confucianism\u201d (chaoru). When introducing and translating Western knowledge they used Confucian vocabulary as much as possible, and Ming\u2013Qing scholars also became accustomed to using the method of \u201cmatching concepts\u201d (geyi) to explain the foreign knowledge that they came into contact with. The connection between \u201cthe study of things to acquire knowledge,\u201d a Confucian term, and Western science and technological knowledge was a product of this double movement. Fang Yizhi's Tongya [Comprehensive Glossary] and Wuli xiaoshi [Notes on the Principle of Things] can be taken as examples. Fang says,

&gt; Agriculture, medicine, arithmetic, measurement, and instruments are practical matters,\u2026 in total, they are the principle of things (wuli), I should write Gezhi quanshu [The Complete Book of Studying Nature to Reach Knowledge]\u2026 morality, economics, essay writing, lesser skills of diviners, these are bound up in the term \u2018laws of Heaven, affairs of men\u2019(tiandao renshi), ceasing when it becomes the essence, this is the principle of nature (xingli) and the principles of things (wuli), exhausting this right up to fate, and its instrument is the Dao, thus one great principle of things. 24

It is worth noting that Fang Yizhi's explanation of \u201cthe study of things to acquire knowledge\u201d is established on the basis of the methodology of \u201cmaterial investigation\u201d (zhice) and \u201ccomprehending seminal forces\u201d (tongji), and takes cognizance of the fact that human affairs (shi), tools (qi), heart-or-mind (xin), human nature (xing), fate (ming), heaven and earth, even nations under Heaven are all things, and are therefore the objects of the investigation of things, thus all can be measured (by experiment, empirical truth) and the method of \u201ccomprehending seminal forces\u201d (a general understanding of the law) can also be investigated. From the methods of \u201cmaterial investigation\u201d and \u201ccomprehending seminal forces\u201d we can derive the embryonic form of later scientific methodology such as inductive and deductive methods, experimentation and theory.

Xu Guangqi, Fang Yizhi and others attempted to differentiate the quest to \u201cinvestigate things to exhaust principle\u201d (gewu qiongli) from the attempt to \u201ccultivate the mind to serve Heaven\u201d (xiushen shitian), in order to bring the former even nearer to the study of (in certain contexts equal to) nature, and break the barrier of the so-called study of principle. This paved the way for the late Qing use of the concept gezhi to represent \u201cscience.\u201d The reason that the Confucian category \u201cgewu zhizhi\u201d (the study of things to acquire knowledge) was able to be used to translate the modern concept of science, lies in the transformation of the concept of wu (things), which is the crucial point. Within the context of classical ritual and music, wu (or \u201chundred wu\u201d or \u201cten thousand wu\u201d) was not an isolated, objective fact, but was a \u201cthing\u201d within a certain relationship, system, order and norm. Under the \u201cGreat Officer\u201d in the \u201cOffices of Earth\u201d section of the Rituals of Zhou, there is a passage, \u201cin the district they use the three merits (wu) to teach the multitudes, and to treat them as guests and recommend them.\u201d 25 The \u201cthree merits\u201d refer to the six virtues (knowledge, benevolence, sageliness, righteousness, loyalty and harmony), the six aspects of conduct (filial piety, friendliness among brothers, being in accord with neighbors, harmonious relations with your wife and mother's relations, being trustful and being sympathetic) and the six arts (ritual, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy and mathematics). By this one knows that the ancient concept of wu had a close relationship to a set of ritual norms: wu was the demonstration of a natural order, while ritual and music were also the direct embodiment of natural order, therefore the wu of natural ordering is also the model of ritual and music. Within the realm of Song\u2013Ming neo-Confucianism, the direct linking of wu and ritual (liyue) systems loosened, it was organized within a system of thought that was constructed with the concepts of \u201cprinciple\u201d (li) and \u201cvital force\u201d (qi) at the center. Neo-Confucians pulled the topic gewu zhizhi from The Great Learning and expanded upon it. Zhu Xi said

&gt; The reaching of knowledge by the investigation of things is to extend my own knowledge to exhaust the principles of the things. For the spirit of man's mind cannot but have knowledge, and all things under heaven cannot but have principle. Only when the principle has not been exhausted, then knowledge is incomplete. 26

The purpose of \u201cinvestigating things\u201d is to \u201creach knowledge through exhausting principle,\u201d while \u201cknowledge\u201d here is mostly a type of moral wisdom.

In Song\u2013Ming neo-Confucianism, the relation of wu and the ordering of ritual became distant, it no longer directly presented a norm for ritual, but had to pass through \u201cinvestigating things\u201d \u2013 \u201capproaching things\u201d (jiwu), \u201cexhausting principle\u201d(qiongli) and \u201creaching the top\u201d (zhiji) in order to win \u201cprinciple.\u201d As a result of the universal belief by Song era Confucians that \u201cprinciple is one, its divisions are multiple,\u201d different things each had their own \u201cprinciple,\u201d thus for \u201cinvestigating things to reach knowledge\u201d they put forth an implied meaning. This is the reason why, since the Song dynasty, studies of the broad (bowuxue) and natural studies (ziranxue) have often been placed under the category of \u201cinvestigating things in order to achieve knowledge.\u201d During the late Qing, the concept of matter (wuzhi) centered on atomic theory provided a premise of epistemology for empirically-based science, the \u201cthings\u201d in the concept of \u201cinvestigating things\u201d was also a factual concept established on the basis of atomic theory, and \u201cprinciple\u201d in the category of \u201cexhausting principle\u201d was no longer moral knowledge, but indicated the objective law of things.

The influence of Confucian moral idealism in \u201cxiu qi zhi ping\u201d (cultivating the self and putting the family in order so as to govern the state and pacify the world) and taking \u201ctianli\u201d (Heavenly principle) as the key to the world outlook in regards to the theory of \u201cinvestigating things in order to acquire knowledge\u201d never really disappeared. Song\u2013Ming Confucians saw the \u201cHeavenly principle\u201d as a characteristic of all things, the source of ethics and the norm for implementation, and took it as the basis for the integration of nature, ethics, politics and other aspects. In this thought system, there was a constant close relationship between the knowledge of Nature and all things (wanwu), with the knowledge of politics and social ordering (zhengzhi zhixu) and the practice of moral standards. Similar to this, the concepts of modern science and gezhi centered on the research into and application of nature. Moreover, they often had mutual liaisons with the categories of politics, ethics and social ordering. Yan Fu, in comparing Thomas Henry Huxley's morality with Spencer's naturalism, took their differences and directly connected it with Liu Zongyuan and Liu Yuxi's \u201cDiscussions on Heaven\u201d dating from the mid-Tang dynasty. In reality, the method of \u201cHeavenly Discussion\u201d would be used \u201cto naturalize\u201d the laws of evolution on natural selection and survival of the fittest. 27 Yan traced the modern theory of evolution back to Liu Zongyuan and Liu Yuxi's \u201cHeavenly Discussion,\u201d and tied Liu Yuxi's discussion of heaven: \u201c(Heaven and Man) mutually conquer each other, mutually assist each other,\u201d together with natural selection in Darwin's theory of evolution. This development showed a fundamental historical cultural relationship: even within the historical view of evolutionary theory, Heavenly Discussion as the proof of legitimacy of the order of reality did not change. Whether it was Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao who in the process of introducing Western Science followed the structure of \u201cpolitics,\u201d \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cart,\u201d or Yan Fu in providing a scientific knowledge system centered on sociology or metaphysics, all of these cultural interpretations tied scientific discovery and scientific methods to the Confucian fields of politics and ethics. Within this context, science and its technological application not only created the conditions to use nature, enriching the country and strengthening the military, but also its discovered \u201corder\u201d was the source for the ordering of mankind's wisdom and the principles of morality. Therefore, the fall of the Heavenly (religious) view of the world and the rise of the scientific world view in late Qing times was not a simple relationship of rise and fall, but they existed at the same time, permeating each other.The concept of science in late nineteenth century to early twentieth century had a very close relationship to the categories of evolution, progress and natural change (jinhua, jinbu, tianyan). Science is not only the representation of the spirit and method of positivism but also the product of the process of \u201cevolution\u201d (tianyan) and the progress of history. By means of an intense critique of thought, the scientific world view ultimately replaced the neo-Confucian outlook of the heavenly principle (tianli) and became the new public principle (gongli), established on the basis of the knowledge of objective laws. In a great number of documents dating from the late Qing era to the May Fourth Movement, we can summarize the sharp opposition between the heavenly principle world view and the public principle world view from several perspectives. First, public principle world view reversed the historical outlook of the heavenly principle world view, the future and not the past came to be viewed as the root origin of ideal politics and morality put into practice. This reversal collapsed the consciousness of historical breakage or fracture embedded in the Confucian world view and along with it the determination to continue with tradition arising from this consciousness, and replaced it with the consciousness of historical continuity and endless evolution, a determination that had certainly broken with the past. Under the dominion of this historical consciousness, it is not by individual moral/political practice that the genealogy of the Dao's transmission (daotong) is reconstructed, but it is rather by devotion to future endeavors that embody the spirit of history, that new ethics are formed. Second, the public principle world view through a straightforward time concept, replaced the heavenly principle world view based on the circumstances of the times or the condition of reason. The situation of time and situation of reason are set in the transformation of the thing itself, they do not weave the transformation of a thing within the orbit of time's teleology, while a straightforward time provides a frame for its teleology, meaning that the change, transformation and development of daily life are included in the orbit of a strictly chronological teleology. Third, the public principle world outlook used the method of atomic theory to construct a category of facts, and this shook-up the pre-packaged metaphysics of the Heavenly principle world outlook, attempting instead to construct the basis of ethics and politics according to the logic of facts and the rules of nature. Because of the final establishment of the factual concept of atomic theory, any resistance to the logic of facts or the laws of nature must recognize the precondition of the dualism of facts and values.

The different branches of orthodox Confucianism have a variety of different explanations for Heavenly principle and \u201cinvestigating things to acquire knowledge.\u201d Similarly modern Chinese thinkers also include different paths to the understanding of science. With Yan Fu establishing the public principle outlook with a school of principle, with studies on Yijing and positivism as a background, with Liang Qichao establishing a public principle outlook through the mind-and-heart school, with the new text school of classics studies and German idealism, with Zhang Taiyan establishing the anti-public principle outlook through the (Buddhist) \u201cschool of Consciousness only\u201d and with the thought of Master Zhuang as background, these together formed three representative cases of various reform plans for the modern world and China. The paradoxes or mutual deconstruction among them provide different viewpoints for rethinking modern problems.

Yan Fu and Liang Qichao represent the directions of two main streams: as the fusion of the school of principle world view and monism (yiyuan lun), Yan Fu's public principle outlook stressed the world's innate uniformity, recognizing that one can understand the innate laws of the universe, the world and man himself by means of investigating things and exhausting principle or through empirical methods; whereas Liang Qichao's thought, the combination of the mind-and-heart school, the new learning of classics school and philosophical dualism (particularly in German idealist philosophy), stressed the existence of a profound chasm between the natural world and the moral world, and that the only method that can connect these two worlds is the implementation of the unity of knowledge and practice (zhixing heyi). The two above mentioned \u201cscientific world outlooks\u201d both presuppose the common nature of knowledge (science) and practice (morality) in terms of methodology. The \u201cinvestigation of things to acquire knowledge\u201d and \u201cthe unity of knowledge and practice\u201d are methods for understanding the world, and at the same time comprise a moral practice that eliminates selfishness while maintaining the public in mind. If we compared Liang Qichao's view with that of Yan Fu, the difference would not be in the a priori public principle or the presupposed Heavenly principle, but in the linked manner of man and these a priori essentials. Yan Fu believed that one could establish a cognitive relationship between man and things by way of the experimental method. By a cognitive process, one reaches the ultimate truth. Whereas Liang Qichao attempted to rebuild the ultimate concept of truth (Heavenly principle, tianli, or instinctive moral knowledge, liangzhi), on the basis of the concept of practice (unity of knowledge and practice) for the purpose of fundamentally uniting man's social and moral practice with the problem of public principle.

As for Zhang Taiyan, \u201cpublic principle\u201d is only a power to oppress and dominate. In the name of public principle, the modern society implements oppression of individuals, its extent far exceeding ancient society and its ethical system centered on the concept of \u201cheavenly principle.\u201d Zhang Taiyan's exposure of scientific public principle is based on two fundamental principles. First, he used the principle of subjective epistemology to differentiate between two kinds of concepts of nature: nature as studied by science is not self-existent nature, but is a nature brought into a specific horizon and category (that is nature that is constructed by science), and this nature lacks an innate essence (it does not have any self characteristics), it shows itself only in the pattern that is (as the result of) the law of causality. From this argument he sets off to obtain a series of conclusions: the concepts of \u201call existent material\u201d (weiwu) and \u201cnature\u201d are fabricated, science as a system to explain things cannot explain the world itself; \u201cpublic principle\u201d and \u201cevolution\u201d are not principles of the universe nor a priori laws, but are man's constructed thoughts. The process of creating \u201cpublic principle\u201d is rather a distorted representation of \u201cprivate\u201d rather than the representation of \u201cpublic\u201d principle (as the original character of nature). As a result, \u201cpublic principle\u201d is synonymous with control and domination. 28 Secondly, he liberates movement of nature from the framework of teleology, negating any moral connotation of evolution, thus rejecting associating individuals with an historical teleology of evolution, refusing to admit that the individual's ethical orientations are based on the laws of movement for the whole of society, rejecting that an individual should be looked upon as an instrument of group evolution. The individual is not a citizen of a country and law, a member of the family and society, a subject of history and ethics, a subject of the relation between \u201chost (man) \u2013 guest (nature)\u2026\u201d In brief, the individual cannot delineate his/her meaning and position through any association with other universal objects. The complete application of atomic theory toppled the social concept established on the basis of the positivist scientific outlook. Zhang Taiyan's opposition to the \u201cpublic principle\u201d world outlook can be seen as the harbinger of the twentieth century's reassessment of modernity.#III. The scientific system and the making of a public principle (gongli) of science

The power of science lies in that it intimately connects a world outlook of universalism with a kind of social system of nationalism/cosmopolitanism, and finally by means of a streamlining of knowledge classification and social division of labor, each type and direction of human activity is included in its broad internal system. There is a very close relation between the popularization of scientific concepts and science as the structure of a systematized field. With the cooperation of the educational reform system, with the backing of the state, the specialization of science education and science dissemination, the system of scientific research gradually took hold in China.

In the 1870s the Gezhi shuyuan (The Chinese Polytechnic Institution and Reading Room) and the Gezhi huibian [The Chinese Scientific Magazine] also symbolized the fact that gezhi was no longer scholars' moral activity of self-cultivation and regulating the family, but an organized, systematized specialist's field of study. The Existence of scientific periodicals, scientific education and scientific bodies indicate that science had spread out in many directions from a common social field. Based on incomplete statistics for not quite 20 years before the May Fourth Movement, from 1900 to 1919, there were in total more than 100 scientific periodicals published: there were 24 natural science periodicals (nine comprehensive, nine mathematical, two geological, two biological and two meteorological); technological scientific periodicals numbered 73 (12 comprehensive, 12 industrial, 14 dealing with communication and transportation, 29 agricultural and five dealing with irrigation), and medical periodicals totaled 29. Six or seven years after the Revolution of 1911, the number of periodicals launched doubled all those of the past. Aside from the 1912 Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry publication Nonglin gongbao [Bulletin of Agriculture and Forestry], the 1907 Guangdong Bureau of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce publication Nong gong shang bao [Agriculture, Industry and Commerce Newspaper] and a few other newspapers and journals run by the government, the majority of science and technology periodicals were published by scientific organizations, universities and a few private persons. Among the most famous were of course the Science Society of China's Kexue [Science], the China Engineer Association represented by Zhan Tianyou published The Journal of China Engineer Association and the earliest scientific organization, the Chinese Geographical Society's publication Dixue zazhi [Journal of Geology]. 29 The creators of the scientific journals came from all over the country, the majority of the sponsoring organizations were professional scientific and technology organizations, and within these groups, a higher standard came from young intellectuals who had studied abroad (in America or Japan). A new kind of intellectual community and cultural atmosphere appeared by means of the popularization of scientific knowledge, the dissemination of scientific thought and the formation of a network of scientific organizations.

If we were to compare the dissemination and practice of science among late Qing intellectuals with the scientific communities of the Republican period and their practice, we would find a distinct shift: Chinese science organizations and other scientific bodies and the appearance of specialized academic periodicals are an indication that Republican China's cultural field embodied a clear-cut difference between scientific culture and the culture of the humanities, while during the late Qing the dissemination of science was an organic part of the dissemination of reform and revolution; Yan Fu and other pioneers did not construct in their division of labor a distinct community apart from other intellectuals. But with the development of scientific bodies and their system and culture whether it is the composition of the members of the society or the classificatory divisions of the publications, all clearly present the difference between scientific culture and culture of the humanities (or daily culture), and a new kind of social grouping or community appears. Scientific communities using a method that is objective in outlook and searching for truth as the only goal differ from other political and cultural fields. As a result two clear cut differences were constructed between scientific culture and other cultures. Science itself or \u201cscience\u201d as a vocabulary item became closely associated with the objective or the concept of the objectivity. Scientific bodies and their activities, using their special discipline, training, method and accurately defined concepts reconstructed man's basic understanding of nature and humanity itself. Not only did the new concepts arising from scientific activities \u2013 such as time, space, elements, atoms, molecules, electricity, steam, energy and geologic system \u2013 expand man's view of the universe and nature, but it also fundamentally changed man's imagined picture of the world. Therefore, the influence of science and its interrelated concepts has far surpassed the division of two cultures, becoming a universal law to measure progress and backwardness, truth and falsity, right and wrong.

There is a subtle difference between the development of this kind of public principle of scientific concepts and the scientific conceptions of the late Qing era. During the late Qing, civilizations and the competition between them held important historical meaning for China's scientific concepts. People recognized that scientific research and the resulting social rules were the major reason that Western society had won in the competition of civilizations. For example, one of the earliest scientific publications, Kexue shijie [Science World] stated:

&gt; Throughout the many countries of the world, there are violent wars, there are placid wars, or industrial wars or agricultural wars, all with the assistance of science. Science is actually an invisible army, a safe bomb\u2026 survival and competition is predicted on science, great victories and terrible defeats are seen through science. 30

According to this judgment, the importance of science originated from the judgment concerning the new circumstances at that time, and did not originate in science itself. With this backdrop, late Qing scientific publications developed a method for understanding science during the debate on civilizational conflicts, its major characteristic being to situate science in the relations of Eastern and Western civilizations, spiritual or material civilization so as to investigate the significance of science. For example, in the third issue (1907) of the early scientific publication, Kexue yiban [One Segment of Science], there appeared \u201cLunlixue zhiyan\u201d [Random Words on Ethics] which stated that:

&gt; Spiritual civilization is intrinsic to our country, what we are behind the West in is material civilization, which we cannot be proud of. Today the West uses material civilization as its base, combined with spiritual civilization. However, for those who want to get rid of the intrinsic spiritual civilization and seek the so-called material civilization, China does not know how to adopt material culture, to combine it with spiritual civilization in order to make up for any shortcomings. Also if spirit doesn't exist, to what can material attach itself\u200a? 31

During the debate on science and metaphysics after the May Fourth Movement, this civilizational dualism provided the historical background for the separation of the modern system of knowledge. For Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi and others, science was a call and symbol of liberation, and it was viewed as the objective foundation for various social cultural reforms.

After the May Fourth East\u2013West cultural debates, science and its association with a specific historical culture gradually was replaced by a type of universal narrative about scientific times. Chen Duxiu said, \u201cToday the world has two roads: one is a bright road that goes toward a republic, science, atheism; the other is a dark road that goes toward dictatorship, superstition and the divine rights of kings\u2026\u201d 32 In his famous essay, \u201cCall to Youth,\u201d Chen Duxiu compared science and its antithesis utilizing the following descriptive vocabulary: \u201cactual benefits\u201d (shili), \u201cgeneral knowledge\u201d (changshi), \u201creason\u201d (lixing), \u201cproof\u201d (shizheng) and their opposites, \u201cempty forms\u201d (xuwen), \u201cimagination\u201d (xiangxiang), \u201carbitrariness\u201d (wuduan) and other words. 33 According to Comte's description of human evolution, mankind had already developed from a \u201creligious superstitious period,\u201d a \u201cperiod of metaphysical fantasy\u201d to \u201ca period of scientific evidence,\u201d and therefore \u201cscientific\u201d must mean progressive, and being in line with the laws of historical development. 34 We can find similar formulations in even earlier documents, such as one written by Wu Zhihui recognizing that:

&gt; The scientific world, and the past few thousand years of non-scientific thought are clearly two different worlds. As for the writings of the non scientific world wanting to represent the scientific world's thought and things, they are farfetched and lack their own opinion, lengthening or cutting short as they see fit, not sufficient for use\u2026 it cannot evolve together with the world and that's all. 35In this context science represents the public principle \u2013 all public principle must be consistent with the laws of science, we can call this the making of the public principle of science. The famous anarchist and science disseminator Wu Zhihui said, \u201cWhat is science? It is the ideal, the systematic, the defined, the ability to classify, the emphasis on evidence\u2026\u201d 36

&gt; Therefore, it is science that allows aesthetics to cause feelings in the world, that allows philosophy to cause the drive to reason, thus through logic one reaches a part of True reason. Aesthetics follows the universe and its work is endless, philosophy follows the universe and its work is endless, the scientific field also follows the universe daily and expands, eternally without end. The True rationalist of material culture is charged by it, the True rationalist of spiritual culture also is charged by it. 37

In fact this public principle concept of science is also the philosophical basis of Wu's anarchist political thought, to quote from his early years:

&gt; The invention of the scientific public principle, the swelling of the revolutionary tide, these are what is characteristic about 19th and 20th century mankind. These two are mutually dependant in carrying out the natural public principle of the evolution of society. The public principle is the desired purpose of the revolution, and the revolution seeks to apply the public principle. Therefore to be rid of public principle is not to be called revolution, to be rid of revolution one cannot advocate public principle. 38

The making of science into the public principle provides a premise for the extensive use of the adjective \u201cscientific.\u201d

Since the twentieth century, not only did various kinds of knowledge appear under the classifications of science \u2013 such as the major division of natural sciences, the social sciences, humanities and the minor divisions of political science, economic science, administrative science \u2013 but also \u201cscience\u201d or \u201cscientific\u201d began to be massively used as an adjective or modifier, in examples such as scientific development, scientific law enforcement and scientific administration. The idea of science almost dominates the field of \u201ctruth.\u201d The different social theories that arose during this time period assumed a scientific appearance, with Marxism, pragmatism and other philosophies describing themselves as types of scientific theory. Also precisely on account of this, almost simultaneous with the rise of the tide of science, another thread within twentieth century Chinese thought formed, which was critical thinking directed against science and its hegemony. During the late Qing, Zhang Taiyan criticized evolution and public principle; during the May Fourth period, Liang Qichao, Liang Shuming and others criticized the biases of scientific civilization from a cultural point of view, which were precursors to the war between \u201cscience and metaphysics\u201d that exploded in 1923.#IV. The civilization debate and the redivision of the field of knowledge

The New Cultural Movement of May Fourth, particularly the journals Xinqingnian [New Youth], Xinchao [New Tide] and other radical cultural publications, caused an intense debate in the cultural world concerning Western and Eastern civilizations. Dongfang zazhi [The Eastern Miscellany], Jiayin, Xueheng [The Critical Review], Guoxue jikan [The National Studies Quarterly] and their authors launched a fierce debate with Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi, who were the representatives of the \u201cNew Cultural Movement.\u201d The 1923 debate on \u201cscience and outlook on life\u201d (also called the \u201cscience and metaphysics debate\u201d) was a natural offshoot of the Eastern and Western civilizations debate.

The debate over Eastern and Western civilization started in the style of historical/cultural narratives, and both sides' discussion of the legitimacy of Eastern and Western civilizations relied on the historical narratives of the respective cultures. This debate took \u201cculture\u201d (wenhua) and \u201ccivilization\u201d (wenming) as its key points; the focus of the argument was over which culture and its values could be taken as a standard or goal for establishing the changing direction of China's society, culture and nation. In his 1921 publication, Eastern and Western Civilizations and their Philosophies, Liang Shuming proposed an historical\u2013cultural point of view that went against the New Culture Movement. According to Liang Shuming's definition, \u201cculture\u2026 is nothing but the people's will (yiyu) to live.\u201d 39 This cultural or civilizational concept relies on the metaphoric relationship of individual life and civilization: similar to an individual's life, culture or civilization is a type of existence with a will and manner. Eastern and Western cultures are sharply divergent and cannot be harmonized, because the wills marking the origins of the civilizations are completely different.

According to the above analogy of a culture or civilization to an individual's life, Liang took \u201cWesternization\u201d as the standard for comparison in differentiating three types of cultural paths: Western, Chinese and Indian. That is to say that \u201cWesternization takes the will's forward demand as its basic spirit. Or: Westernization, by means of the will's forward demand, is the spirit that produces the two great wonders of civilization: \u2018science\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019.\u200a\u201d 40 \u201cChinese civilization takes self-cultivation (ziwei) of the will, harmony (tiaohe), and being balanced (chizhong) as its basic spirit.\u201d \u201cIndian civilization takes returning to the past of the will as its basic spirit.\u201d 41 The relation of the three directions in a modern language context in the first place embodies Liang's idea of the incommensurability of \u201cEasternization\u201d and \u201cWesternization.\u201d In Liang's writings topics such as science/art, science/metaphysics and reason/intuition are nothing but the specific characteristics of \u201cWesternization\u201d and \u201cEasternization\u201d which are the result of different \u201cwills.\u201d According to this concept of culture, the incommensurability of science and metaphysics, or reason and intuition, is decided because in Liang's view national cultures cannot be harmonized. We can largely summarize the basic views of Liang Shuming in the following schematic:

- Eastern\u2009=\u2009metaphysics\u2009=\u2009art\u2009=\u2009opinion\u2009=\u2009metaphysical talk\u2009=\u2009noumenon\u2009=\u2009private morality\u2009=\u2009\u2003returning to the past\u2009=\u2009the second, third directions

- Western\u2009=\u2009science\u2009=\u2009learning\u2009=\u2009knowledge\u2009=\u2009ethics\u2009=\u2009phenomenon\u2009=\u2009public morality\u2009=\u2009\u2003modernization\u2009=\u2009the first direction

In Liang's discussion of culture, \u201cscience\u201d is not only a problem of knowledge, \u201cmetaphysics\u201d is not only a problem concerning ethics, but they indicate two different civilizational problems represented by science and metaphysics. In scientific civilizations, all science, politics, economics, ethics, law and philosophy belong to science, rationalized and understood, but in metaphysical civilizations, all science, politics, economics, ethics, rituals and thought are metaphysical, artistic and intuited. Therefore, in scientific civilizations, there does not exist an incommensurability between science and ethics, because there exists an ethics of science; in a metaphysical civilization, there does not exist an incommensurability between ethics and knowledge, because there exists a knowledge of ethics. Incommensurability exists only between the two kinds of civilizations.

In 1923, Zhang Junmai's talk, \u201cPhilosophy of Life,\u201d delivered to a class of Tsinghua University students preparing to study in the United States set off the great debate concerning \u201cscience and the philosophy of life.\u201d From the debate over \u201cEastern and Western civilizations\u201d to the debate over \u201cscience and the philosophy of life,\u201d the most important change was that the former's East/West dualism was transformed into the latter's science/metaphysics dualism. Against the background of the First World War, people from two different directions launched a critical debate about scientific civilization. From a cultural direction, they established Chinese culture as the main stream through a comparison with Western civilization, and rejected the universal claims of Western civilization; from the direction of knowledge, through differentiating the dualism of \u201cscience and philosophy of life,\u201d they separated ethics, psychology and other social sciences from the complete system of natural sciences. Therefore they rejected the universal idea of scientific common examples (gongli) or scientific rules (guize), in truth they re-established man as the main force in the field of knowledge. Zhang Junmai said:

&gt; These 20 or 30 years of European thought, have been called: \u2018anti-mechanistic\u2019 which is possible; it has been labeled, \u2018anti-intellectualism\u2019 which is possible; it has been called, \u2018anti-fatalism\u2019 which is possible; it has been called \u2018anti-secularism\u2019 which is possible. If I slightly imitate the three divisions of the law of Comte's time, and seek one of the characteristics of the modern period, I must name it, the \u2018new metaphysical time.\u2019 42

This \u201cnew metaphysical time\u201d can also be formulated as anti-scientific time.

In the \u201cscience and metaphysics debate,\u201d Zhang Junmai located the problem in the opposing relations of \u201cscience and the philosophy of life,\u201d his purpose was to use independence, variety, fortuity and uniqueness of the philosophy of life to oppose the universalism of science, and thus to clearly differentiate the boundaries of the natural sciences from spiritual science. He said, \u201castronomy is universal in the world, I've never heard of English astronomy or French astronomy\u201d; 43 whereas the \u201cspiritual sciences\u201d like politics, economics, psychology and sociology don't have \u201ca firm and solid principle.\u201d 44 The diversity of \u201cthe philosophy of life\u201d is in direct relation to the diversity of a \u201cnation's\u201d culture and the autonomy of an individual's psyche. Using the diversity of the spirit to oppose the universality of science, using the diversity of culture and history to oppose the universalism of \u201cscientific civilization\u201d (Western civilization) and using the differences in principle of the subject to oppose the united principle of the common standard (gongli) principle of \u201cscience\u201d is the historical connotation of \u201cscience and the philosophy of life\u201d as a pair of opposing rhetorical modes. By opposing science with the philosophy of life, the problem of history and culture was ultimately transformed into a problem about abstract and universal knowledge. It was not the difference of Chinese essence and Western function, nor the confrontation of Eastern and Western civilizations, but it was the opposition of science and metaphysics, physics and psychology and reason and intuition, which structured the center of the discussion. With this as the axis, the system of universal scientific knowledge began to split apart into incommensurate, differing independent fields, that is, the field of science and the field of the spirit.

At the end of 1923, Zhang Junmai, at the request of the Taidong Publishing House, compiled and edited the book Renshengguan zhi lunzhan [The Debate on the Philosophy of Life]. In the preface to this collection on the debate, Zhang Junmai gets directly to the point by citing Mill's 1843 work, A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive (Zhang translated this as Lun lixue) which sighs over \u201clife's problems still not reaching the realm of science,\u201d indicating that this had not yet been resolved in the 80 years since, nor could it ever be solved. But clearly seeing the differences between psychological studies and natural subjects did not prevent Mills from promoting in methodology the scientification of psychology and sociology, while the orientation of Zhang Junmai's efforts were in the opposite direction, with Zhang clearly striving to strictly differentiate psychology, sociology and political science from physics, astronomy and other scientific fields. 45 In terms of logic, Zhang Junmai's criticism of sociology and views on psychology are identical. According to his logical inference, if an individual's psyche and behavior were not controlled by the law of causality, then a society's behavior, which is composed individuals\u2019 behavior, has no \u201cpublic principle\u201d to follow. 46&gt; In a similar manner an individual's psychology and society's life go beyond science, so on account of this, therefore it follows that in order to define it: the outlook on one's life is objective, intuitive, comprehensive, and determined by free will, arising from the singular nature of one's character\u2026 since the 19th century, there has been the confused dream of desiring to advance human affairs through science, can we now wake up from this? 47

According to the above-mentioned reasoning, Zhang Junmai categorized psychology and sociology in the realm of human outlook. Not only did he make this an independent category, separate from the nature of science, but also he rejected the concept of social science. In his view, Comte and Marx from their different directions established their theories on the rules and principles of the law of causality and wholism. Therefore, their theories are a rejection of man's free will.

Through his reflection on \u201cthe limits of science,\u201d Zhang Jumai also put forward a new knowledge system, a system that was capable of including science with \u201cknowledge beyond science.\u201d In this system, the fields of metaphysics, aesthetics, religion and ethics have already separated from the chart of \u201cscience,\u201d and they have been established as independent fields of knowledge. Compared with the former concept of science, this knowledge system still includes a kind of division of the system of knowledge, but it is metaphysics and not a positivist sociology that resides in the commanding position. Zhang Junmai noted that:

&gt; Although research on classificatory systems cannot be avoided, the right or wrong of the study of classificatory systems should be measured entirely by the highest principle of the various studies, and is integrated in metaphysics. Metaphysics is the final judge of various studies. 48

In terms of the position of the principle of classification and the comprehensive perspective in this chart of knowledge, his views though go beyond one's expectations while approximating a close approach to Nishi's empiricism. But the differences are: Zhang Junmai not only demands retaining the territory of metaphysics within the fields of scientific knowledge, but moreover he demands establishing autonomous fields for psychology, sociology, political science and economics beyond the knowledge of science \u2013 these fields cannot take commands from science or the science of science, \u201csociology,\u201d but can only take commands from metaphysics \u2013 and metaphysics becomes the precondition of all knowledge.

#V. Conclusion

The concept of science in modern Chinese thought received the influence of Comte, Spencer and Huxley (as well as Russell, Dewey and Marx) in regard to the explanation and application of science and scientific method, and also was permeated by the elements of traditional Chinese epistemology, ethics and cosmology. As the key content and important means of the modernization movement to enrich the country and strengthen the military, scientific research and its technological application also provided the concepts, values, methods and organization for the new system of knowledge and cultural language. With this as background, the \u201cpublic principle\u201d of science replaced the traditional outlook of Heavenly principle, becoming and forming the foundation of the modern world outlook. Centering on the relations between science and the nation, science and the times, science and civilization and scientific fields and spiritual fields. Modern Chinese thought produced a string of debates, these debates not only opened up the road for scientific research, but also offered clues to the formation of modern knowledge. Science is one of the most important concepts in modern Chinese thought.

It's a naughty kid (doesn't matter what age). Chide him.

The Chinese way is to open the door and shout at full volume.There was a huge debate in China and eventually science won.Masculinity is a SOCIAL CONSTRUCT!!!!\&gt; implying the pranker is not actually an old grandma with a walking canewo cwo le!!! dwi bu qi!!no wonder pixelpirater is so madyeah not gonna name namesThe amount of effort to coordinate an organized campaign to encourage researchers to consciously cite each other with the express intent of increasing their university's standing in a single world ranking is too big for a minimal increase in prestige. This sort of increase is not directly relevant to CCP's survival, nor is it directly beneficial to the university given that it was ranked in 2nd place one or two years ago too. There is simply too little incentive for too much effort.

This is more a result of their cite spamming than anything else. Professors within China spam low quality works citing each other since they can't be bothered to find a decent source (in English). Within China, Tsinghua has the highest prestige so naturally engineering works cite Tsinghua most frequently.

Colleges do game rankings, but they don't game it by encouraging academics to cite each other. One way of gaming rankings is to artificially decrease acceptance rate by spamming advertisement to encourage underqualified applicants to apply.&gt; China's Gini coefficient stood at 52.23%Thanks.The burden of proof that Tsinghua has deliberately organized a targeted campaign to increase its ranking specifically on US News World Rankings through cross-citations and spamming publications is on your side.Yes.WatCantonese brah, do you know it?China has accrued a huge debt, all going towards nonsense like a high-speed railroad into Tibetan highlands (for what!?)

It would be interesting to see what would happen when the economy can't handle the bureaucracy and corruption of high ranking officers, but oh they think doubling down on the "Chinese Dream" is going to work out like magic!This feels like an allegory of a rich HK businessman telling the white kid on the Peak to shut up at 1 a.m. outside his mansion.LOL&gt; baijiu, the Chinese firewater whose sharp, pungent odor brings tears to your eyes.I like heads n shoulders lemon shampoo makes my hair smell lemony and fresh also I like to smell myselfWorking fridge, just a bit dirty

Pick up at Milestone 357, Lion Rock Hiking Trial East, Shatin, Hong Kong&gt; would of

FUCK RIGHT OFF

Come back again with less-than-shitty grammar.BULLSHIT&gt; using "would of"Are you sure homosexuality is *legalized*? AFAIK it's decriminalized but not necessarily legalized.Edgy title, good article\&gt; history assignment on clan chatMax your clan castle and air sweeper and elixir storage.Do hogs and zapquake strategies.

You aren't supposed to spam dragons. Lv 3 drags are only useless if you use them wrongly.You are missing a lot of crucial research...Why are people spreading this unfounded and evidence-less article??

This has already been hotly debated in r/china; the article has a bias towards exaggerating and speculation and it is highly unlikely that this is anything close to True.

There is no citation or evidence indicating the major claims of the articles, and anyone who could read the original Chinese text will come to the conclusion that this article is based on pure speculation.

https://np.reddit.com/r/China/comments/3nhje1/in_china_your_credit_score_is_now_affected_by/?sort=confidence

A lot of posters in r/china has cast into doubt the credibility of the article.

Make no mistake, China is tightening Internet censorship controls and Chinese censorship has taken a turn for the worse, but one must distinguish fact from fiction, and in this case, the article is more likely based on ***fiction***.

Here's a rebuttal found in r/sino, which is vehemently pro-china to the degree of absurdity, but nevertheless it is informative:

They actually voice their racism in public too. Honestly, it's far more racist than mainland China. I'm sorry HK, but sometimes I dislike you more than China.

Your storage structures need to be centralized.

You don't need to wall off every defense. There are smart ways to go about leaving some defenses unwalled while being effective.

Do not make T-junction wall sections, those will be targeted by wall breakers and wall breakers will be able to open two compartments at the same time.

The body structure of Eastern and Western people are different.

......Beta as fuckkkNo if their Mandarin does not have a mainland accent.You are wrong. Eastern females have an extra small organ, citursia, that regulates body temperature, and is located on the left side of the stomach. Hot fluid entering the oesophagus gets diverted into the citursia which enables the organ to use the heat energy within the liquid to power the filis of the organ to make the body warm in a cold temperature or in events that decrease the body's temperature, such as a period.That's entirely not helpful. OP already knows that strategyI'm only going to discuss TH7 vs. TH8 strategies. TH7s can reliably three star lower TH8s and give a shot at a higher one.

- Dragloon with 3 rage (useful for centralized ADs) 10 drag 4 CC loons

Find a side of the base where 2 ADs will be reached by the dragons. Use 2 rage to allow the dragons to reach the core safely, and 1 rage for back end balloons that will target the third AD (within two defenses) once it locks on to a dragon.

- 10 drag 4 CC hogs OR 9 drag 4 CC hogs 4 hogs (useful for when an AD is easily hogged)

3 Zap an AD, hog the easiest-to-reach AD (don't do this if the hogs can never reach it), and drag on the side of the last AD.

- Funneling

You need to funnel well for better drag attacks. Use cutter dragons at the start of a funnel to cut away edge buildings on a line, and then once they are gone, put the remaining dragons in an appropriate fashion. This ensures the dragons won't shop.There are interesting dragon variants at TH7 that one could use effectively against early to mid TH8.

10 dragons is not always the best strategy.Is this a joke

If someone farts I will walk away.Oh come on it's not like she would die from drinking hot water.LOLKeyword here being "deploy". Either support used the wrong word or it is actually coming True.

Or this picture is a fake.No he is not. Can you not read?The question is about general TH7 vs. TH7/TH8 strategies (hence why he mentioned low TH8s).

Even at TH7 vs. TH7, dragon variants can be better than pure mass drags.We will probably see articles about the grass posted here for quite a while.Depending on the layout, 

9 drag 4 loons 4 cc loons

9 drag 4 hogs 4 cc hogs

Southern newspapers really seem to love doing these sorts of things, and yet they never seem to be get into trouble.This is speculation based on what I've read. 

If you're fluent/native to a language, you brain is capable of reading words fast due to frequent retrieval of language information. This means you absorb an entire sentence and your brain recognizes individual characters and group them together automatically. Our brains are different from a machine. A machine would read a word such as "programming" as p -&gt; r -&gt; o -&gt; g -&gt; r -&gt; a -&gt; m -&gt; m -&gt; i -&gt; n -&gt; g. But our brain reads in chunks once you're fluent in the language like: pro -&gt; gram -&gt; [m]ing, due to recognizing ing as a suffix, program as a stem word, etc., because we frequently see these appearing over and over again. A beginner in a language will not be able to do this because they can't identify the groupings in a word, sentence etc. immediately. Errors in language will automatically be fixed by your brain since they most closely identify with a known word. Machines will throw an error if they see "porgram" but your brain would not since the brain functions by association and not strict I/O.

 I didn't notice anything until I finished the last sentence.No you don't. You will need to pay for Microsoft 10 if you do not upgrade to Microsoft 10 within one year of Microsoft 10 releasing.

\&gt; farther from the truth

OK.

NASA is banning anyone (Chinese nationals) from entering a NASA facility on the simple grounds that Chinese nationals are assumed to be spies stealing work. This is blatant racism. It is equivalent to barring Middle East natives from entering the USA because they are assumed to be terrorists.

Bringing politics into academia and science is bad for academia, no matter in what form. Research institutions and academia should prioritize and encourage people from all around the world to partake in research and not actively ban people due to a supposed possibility.

This ban is actively harming Chinese nationals genuinely interested in research within the US. Most Chinese graduates and postgraduates are not spies, but this law strikes them down and forbids them for participating in certain events for the simple fact that they are Chinese. This is racism.

If you think academia and science should be muddled with politics you are part of the problem. My stance isn't in the minority either.

This is a fundamental issue. I never even knew about the NASA ban on Chinese nationals until I looked it up. It is absolutely disgusting and abhorrent that the Congress sees fit to bring their despicable and inhumane, corrupted Wall Street and militaristic ideology into NASA, which is supposed to be a civil institute for research. Their paranoia of Chinese nationals is borderline racist and disgusting.Personalization as in..?20 giants / 8 WB / 46 Arch / 38 Gobs / 3X Heal

10 giants on two points on the same side, WB to break open, Arch to set up funnel, heal when needed, gobs to run into core.

Alternatively

20 giants / 8 WB / 72 Arch / 12 Gobs / 3X Heal

This relies on the mortars being eliminated.

Up to you.

20 giants  / 8 WB / 56 Arch / 12 Gobs / 8 Minions / 4 Hogs / 3X Heal

This is a fantastic combination capable of breaching the core of most TH7s once you're done with DE upgrades. Once defenses get distracted by giants, hogs can go in and clean up defenses by themselves with little penalty. Minions and gobs go into the core and get storage easily. The use of minions and goblins helps to prevent storage looting group from being wiped out completely by AD or mortar, and 12 gob/8 minions have a high enough DPS to loot the storage fast, while giants and hogs and BK are slowly being wiped out.Racism declares a scope of nationality in several definitions.

It is racist because they are banning Chinese nationals from entering any NASA facility, even if an event taking place in such facilities has nothing to do with weapons research, satellite technology etc.

Science and academia should be independent of such trivialities. There is a marked difference between protecting industry secrets vs. the situation here.

Go read this yourself: http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.htmlIf you haven't seen that ridiculous thread, shut up. I am not going to link to that thread or provide more information because the moderators have told me not to do so. Go away.

Again, regulars in this sub know what I'm referring to and I frankly don't care what a non-regular thinks.

I'm guessing you're Australosaurus seeing as no one else is giving me headache on this insignificant problem. If you haven't read the thread, obviously you are in no position to declare anything. That thread was massively downvoted and criticized by people in this sub so I feel no need to defend myself against your ridiculous accusations.Were it not for the fact that I'm bombarded by so many bigots on this sub I will give you a refutation.

The reason why academia is compromised today is because of bigots thinking they are not racist or xenophobic in doing wildly racist and xenophobic acts harshly applied on academia.

Congress continuously swoops to new lows (with the public somehow supporting their racist and xenophobic actions) and in no time we would be doing the same thing as CCP.It shocks me that people on this sub do not see this as blatant racism. I am severely disappointed.Are you retarded?

I DID NOT say "China should attack Japan and get it over with" is China bashing. I said those types of things are annoying and I don't wish to see them.

Fuck off.

You are most definitely Australosaurus.Can we fucking stop posting this Sesame Credit bullshit. This is like the sixth or seventh time.Racial qualities tend to correlate with nationality, and in a significant portion of definitions that are tied with government institutions, nationality is covered under the definition of racism and anti-discriminatory laws. As a concession, in the case that this is not racism, it remains as discrimination against nationality and general bigotry.

It is highly unfair to ban **all** Chinese nationals from entering NASA facilities on the simple grounds that they may be spies, when the percentage of spies in Chinese nationals is significantly low. This is basically like banning all Iranians from entering flights into America because they may be terrorists.

People will decry the latter as racism straight away but I don't see anyone decrying this equally bigoted sentiment towards Chinese nationals. Oh wait, people are decrying it, just not on /r/China.

I'd rather stick with the opinions of professors in esteemed institutions than randos on the Internet. No doubt you're going to whine about appealing to authority but I don't care.So you support America swooping down to the levels of CCP? This ban harms Chinese nationals going to America pursuing science and escaping the harsh rule of CCP more than it deters Chinese spies, who would not be spying with a Chinese passport in the first place.Another case of film industries bowing down to Chinese market and sacrificing integrity.This is a significant change and more than enough to show that the film industry is bowing down to the Chinese market.Discrimination against Chinese nationals has contributed to racism against Chinese people by attributing the possibility of them being a spy. In most real world scenarios you wouldn't take out a passport anywhere you go, so most people judge and assume a person's nationality through racial qualities. This means that people may be wary to share scientific knowledge with Chinese people in general, since it is entirely possible for a spy to simply acquire an American passport.

This is becoming like the hate on Russians for no particular reason on Reddit and in America in general. This decision is based on the paranoia that all Chinese nationals are spies and resorts to the easiest but most discriminatory way out and that is to issue a flat out total ban.

Academic conferences held in NASA that is directly relevant to a graduate's career, for example, should not be banned for Chinese nationals simply because of their location. This law is hurting Chinese nationals scientists who want to be Americans, and there are plenty of them by denying them opportunities that other people get based on an unfair discrimination.

I'm not saying racism including nationality is agreed with by professors, I'm saying that this ban is outrageous to most people in academia, whether they see it as racism or not. I see it as racism.This is a ban on Chinese nationals from going to any NASA facility for any reason, even if they are entirely unrelated to NASA work.I have already explained why it is racist and since we have differing fundamental beliefs I will not debate you on this further. This political decision is compromising academia and scientific integrity by polluting it with needless politics, something that professors in esteemed institutions believe.They may be there to do scientific work that is not related to NASA work. Such as attending a physics conference. Perhaps you should read the linked articles next time instead of jumping to conclusions.http://nasawatch.com/archives/2013/10/frank-wolf-dump.html

NASA is hurt by politics and the public still continues to support corrupt politicians without any sympathy for science. Abhorrent.Everyone from British to Americans see through the bigotry and racism of HK people. Are you trying to justify racism?Is Hong Kong a racist society?

For the longest time, as a member of a local Chinese middle-class family, I didn't think we were. Sure, I grew up with the occasional unpleasant encounters with some arrogant Brits when the Crown still ruled Hong Kong. But I didn't think my race and class - in short my kind - could be discriminating systematically against other minorities.

But we do. Just read the news. Seventy per cent of kindergartens interview applicants and print written materials only in Chinese, thereby effectively cutting off minorities who don't know the language. Banks' treatment of customers from ethnic minorities have got so bad that the Equal Opportunities Commission has started helping to train frontline staff on local anti-discrimination laws.

Meanwhile, it's common knowledge that many landlords and real estate agents refuse to provide service or lease flats to people with an ethnic background.

There are 30-plus schools subsidised by the government that cater specifically to children of ethnic minorities. Why?

Though this government has stepped up Chinese-language training to help those students integrate into local schools and universities, initial assessment of the language-training programme has not been encouraging. It's beginning to look more like window dressing than a real attempt at ending this de facto apartheid at the heart of our education system.

Some of our top clubs bar foreign domestic helpers from accessing areas reserved for members, even if they have to take care of children going to swimming pools or attending gyms. When you are in the dominant majority, you don't notice these things and can ignore them, even if they present themselves to you. You speak English and Putonghua and you think the city is like you too, cosmopolitan and international. But we are not.

Some of our outright racism has been transformed into native xenophobia against mainland visitors, though we deny it's racist because mainlanders are Chinese too. We have more bigots among us than we care to admit. The path to change first requires at least recognition of the problem, but we are not even there yet.

Ridiculous how some Hongkongers and Chinese people still attempt to justify their racism against white, south Asian, Filipino people.

I'm so glad I left the racist and xenophobic shithole that is Hong Kong. Seeing people making discriminatory remarks against Indians, whites, Filipinos, ... America is truly much more tolerant than China.Kek

Now that I think about it I'm the biggest hypocrite in the world because I'm racist against Chinese people myself.About to upgrade my TH so I'll see...Nah all chinese even tibetansChina is really racist in general. It's just more obvious in HK.

Who am I to judge though when I'm really racist myself.Hollywood sucks. They should just relocate to China.LOLChinese banks sucksNot go to a massage place.Mainstream movies in America sucks nowadays. I don't know how people can stand that hyped crap.I love the random dancing in Bollywood movies; it's too cute!OMG just fucking partition SCS according to regional population size and get it over with. Why are people advocating for war? You realize if we fire on Chinese vessels there will be at least a regional conflict? The result will be disastrous to both countries. If you want USA to wage war against China, go volunteer yourself. I don't want to see Americans dying for such a pathetic reason.Informal fallacies arise from the negation of crucial elements in a semi-logical construct.

For example,

    A makes claim X
    There is something objectionable about A
    Therefore claim X is more likely False

The negation of "more likely" is why people keep using "ad hominem", "appealing to authority" to end an argument, when in fact the claim automatically assumes "more likely" rather than "strictly."

It does not follow that if there is something objectionable about A, then A's claim is automatically False.

But it does follow that, for example

    A makes claim X in field B
    There is something objectionable about A in field B (II)
    Therefore it is more likely for claim X to be False (III)

where (II) -&gt; (III) is implicitly:

    Having knowledge in field B means claims in field B are more likely valid

It remains for one to consider whether believing in evolution or not contributes to or damages one's understanding of societal issues or not, which is unlikely.

Humans don't have the time to follow strict logic - too much brainpower and energy and time to be efficient. Most of the time appealing to authority and using ad hominem is an approximate enough method to clean up things fast.No both US and China are going to bleed for a long time for no reason. The only reason US is strong is because it avoided major conflicts so far, and this is what we should do. There's an advantage in maintaining power projection across the globe without being too far involved in wars.

You realize China has nukes right? I can see CCP just getting mad and launching nukes. Getting involved in a war with China will also cause Russia deciding to be opportunistic and at least take away some strategic advantage in the Middle East, if not invading East Europe.

There is far too much to lose to attack China for such a petty reason.How do you pronounce milk with a long lThey are unlikely to open fire since they have more to lose than the US does.Transportation of Yak meatYes most are fluent in CantoAs if China recycles things properlyOh I see what you mean.

The calculation of population must be the population on the coast so China cannot get a disproportionate amount of waters. A strict partition of EEZs is needed, and just saying "follow the UNCLOS guidelines" is not sufficient since all the countries have their own interpretation.Yes McDonald's breakfast is its only saving grace but no sane human  can possibly eat sausage egg mcmuffin for breakfast.Fry your own chicken duhIf you disagree i wish you shit sausage egg mcmuffinlol as if mcdonalds doesn't use hormone chickensDid you turn off dataLOLGlad to enlighten you on the hierarchy of fast food like a True American would do.See if you're using a blocked port for torrenting.

I used rankings to look at what college I want to go to.

Here's why: I don't like studying. I don't care what college I go to.

I can assure you a lot of people aren't like me and are genuinely interested in the school culture and specific faculty. So don't worry about ranking culture permeating through society.

But I'm not. I just want to graduate with a good GPA and find a nice job because my life goals lie outside of jobs and studies. So I look at rankings to determine which schools to apply to and get it over with.Engineering *facilities* is good and comparable in Tsinghua vs. MIT since China invests so much money into it. It is the culture and students that don't manage to utilize it properly. If you are willing you can still shine if you make the effort to utilize those facilities.This. Science should be beyond politics and anyone attempting to drag politics into science should be ignored and shamed.

Academia is the last bastion of free thought and we don't need politicians slamming their ideology (just to get votes) into science.Lol wtfYou need to have upgraded your barracks at early TH7.

If China is a rogue state, then America can also be considered a rogue state in certain respects. Furthermore, the concept of "rouge state" is in itself a US-centric construct devised for the US's own ends.

I think you should stick to link posts and avoid self posts.The comments on that article (Reader's picks) are mostly really good (the first one from Manitoban is typical Murica).

http://puu.sh/kJcmO.pngYou are conflating what he said with your own biased interpretation of what he said. The fact that US is tolerating Saudi Arabia implies that the US is using "human rights" as a political tool. There is nothing hinting at "we should ignore morality in all cases" in his comment.

Banning collaboration with China is due to Republican paranoia of China (see Trump), getting votes for not collaborating with a country with no human rights (typical Democrats), and protecting industry interests who are making massive profits and themselves exploiting human rights and creating modern day slavery. There is nothing altruistic about banning China from NASA facilities even when an event taking place there has nothing to do with NASA (see Guardian article), this ban is motivated by politics under a "human rights" and "protect our economy" guise. Human rights? If so, then why is Saudi Arabia not banned? This means that the US selectively bans countries based on human rights issues, permitting some countries while banning others. This inconsistency shows that human rights is not the objective of such a ban. If it is, then all countries with human rights violations would be banned. Protect our economy? Whose profits are being lost to China? Just to megacorporations who have nothing to do but whine about not getting 11bn profits this year. Helping these corporations does absolutely nothing for the public. Such a ban is not helpful to the average American at all, and yet Congress makes it seem like we all have a part to play by supporting this ban.

This ban is purely political. The people who enforced this ban on NASA (a Republican known for despising NASA) are not only denying Chinese nationals who want to contribute to science and escape CCP brutality crucial opportunities for research (since many non-NASA conferences may take place there), interfering in civil science agencies with highly political agendas, and also contributing to the zeitgeist that it is OK to muddle politics into science.

Science should be above all this, and it is highly despicable for any politician to even think of enforcing their misguided ideology onto NASA.

The reason why NASA is underfunded today and the reason why we are beginning to see politics seeping into science is because of people like you who agree with anything the Congress does to interfere with research and scientific development. Too bad NASA is in its last days now, with the government seeing fit to fund a massive military for no reason and severely underfunding all civil research agencies. Now NASA is becoming a political tool and there's not much the scientists can do lest they want their funding cut by barbaric Republicans, who are somehow supported by people like you.lol okNorth Korea is certainly very much a rogue state though I seriously doubt they are in any capacity to threaten world peace.shove a sausage mcmuffin up your ayi's assHmm... there are many potential definitions for rouge state, but no one really knows since the term is ~~created~~ spread by politicians anyways.#Abstract 

To what extent do Chinese citizens support the concept of the Chinese
dream? What is the major source for the support of the Chinese dream among Chinese
citizens? There is almost no representative-sample study to systematically address these
questions. To fill in this gap, this article examines the intensity and the source of the
Chinese people\u2019s support for the Chinese dream. Based on a seventeen-cities survey,
this research revealed the following: first, the support for the Chinese dream among
Chinese urban residents is very high and real; second, the concept of the Chinese dream
has three dimensions (i.e., national dream, social dream, and individual dream) and a
strong collectivistic feature which is in sharp contrast with the individualistic American
dream. The construction of the Chinese dream is actually based on Chinese traditional
culture: respect for political authority, desire for social order and support for a powerful
government. In the end, this research suggests that the construction of the Chinese
dream should remain open and change with the evolving public values in China.

#Conclusion
Since the findings presented above are based on a seventeen-cities survey, we do not
intend to generalize these findings to the rest of the country. Nonetheless, we do believe
that the findings from this study are theoretically and empirically heuristic for analysis
of both the level and source of the Chinese dream. Given the scarcity of representativesample
survey studies of this sort, the findings from our study are very useful for
establishing some conceptual and empirical baselines for subsequent studies of the
Chinese dream. Here, we highlight some important findings and implications.
Firstly, the support for the Chinese dream among Chinese urban residents is
extremely high and real. This finding refutes some arguments by foreign scholars that
the concept of the Chinese dream is ideological propaganda without firm support from
Chinese citizens. Therefore, we can conclude that, the core values of the Chinese dream
(i.e., strong China, harmonious China, and individual development) have considerable
appeal to the majority of urban residents.
Secondly, the Chinese dream is a comprehensive system of values with different
dimensions. Based on the research findings, I argue that the concept of the Chinese
dream has three distinct dimensions: national dimension, social dimension and individual
dimension. More importantly, these three dimensions, by not conflicting with each
other, show a close interrelationship instead. Most urban residents tend to link national
dream, social dream, and individual dream together. In other words, by their support of
the individual dream, they also support the national dream and the social dream.
Thirdly, the concept of the Chinese dream has three dimensions (i.e., national dream,
social dream, and individual dream) and a strong collectivistic feature which is in sharp
contrast with the individualistic American dream. From this research, I found that the
Chinese dream is actually based on the Chinese traditional culture. The Chinese dream
is closely related to the three traditional political values of; respect for political
authority, desire for social order and support for powerful government. In other words,
these three traditional political values of respect for political authority, desire for social
order and support for a powerful government constitute the foundation of cultural
expression of the Chinese dream.
Finally, I believe that the Chinese dream should absorb new values in an open way.
Modernization is a very important force. A large number of literature shows that the
level of economic and social development has a positive impact on the political
orientations of ordinary people. With rising economic development, the interaction
between individuals and state power also increases. Such interaction can encourage
individuals to participate in political activities and acquire more political communication
skills. In addition, the economic development will change the structure of society:
the middle class will become the majority, and the social structure will transform from a
Urban Chinese Support for the Chinese Dream 157
pyramid-shape to a diamond-shape. The middle class is considered to be the most
active participant in political activities and the group with the most modern political
values. All in all, economic development will eventually change the political attitudes
of individuals and liberate the public from traditional political values, thereby
possessing modern political values.27
Some empirical studies previously based on Chinese society suggest that the level of
economic development in different regions of China may influence the political values of
Chinese people. With a higher level of economic development, people will have more time
and resources to enhance their civic competence and political efficacy, thus favoring more
modern political values.28 These studies also show that with a higher level of economic
development in a region, people may hold an increasingly critical attitude towards Chinese
traditional political values and increasingly cherish modern political values.
In this way, economic development will make the Chinese public lean away from
the influence of traditional political values, and move toward modern political values.
Therefore, the construction of the Chinese dream should remain open and change with
the rising level of economic development and adjust its contents in line with the
evolving public values in China.

Sure, the award to Liu Xiaobo can possibly be consTrued as opportunistic awarding, but are the peasants seriously going to see this Science Prize as a conspiracy?

Fuck what the fuck is wrong with Chinese peasants? While everyone else is clapping and commending the courage she had to try the drug on herself and Nobel's recognition that TCM can be a pathway to modern medicine, Chinese peasants decide to shit on her and talk about a conspiracy against China.

Keep shitting on each other, Chinese peasants, sure, that's the only way to make your country grow strong.

I now have a revamped view on Chinese science sucks. It's because a lot of people in China treat science as a means to political capital, money, without actual regard to real science. It's also why you see tons of shit publications from Tsinghua. And if you don't flow with this corrupt zeitgeist you'll get swept away into obscurity and poverty. The West has this problem too, but not so far as to create an entire society of scientists who are more concerned with money and positions than anything else. This is also why I'm adamant against politics interfering in science, but I'm not going to go into that.

Ha. Not me. I live in one.

Circumstances may be different but I'm positive that many Chinese international students would prefer to stay in America as well. At least in the field of mathematics, from what I can gather the Chinese international graduates are losing steam and underperforming compared to previous generations; perhaps this is simply because of a larger influx of these students and thus diluting quality. Furthermore, Chinese students finding cultural integration hard is the primary reason for not wanting to stay in America rather than institutional discrimination.

You're oversimplifying the situation for your argument and what you're saying is vastly misrepresenting the situation at hand.

Finally, you're describing the typical academia struggle. Every graduate has the face that same struggle. Asians think their struggle in academia is unique but it isn't. Let's also not forget the fact that Asians are only recently entering academia more.Repost:

The future of China is inexorably an urban one. Within the next 15 years, a billion Chinese\u201470 % of the population\u2014will be living in urbanized areas. In anticipation of this, in March of 2014 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council issued the National New-Type Urbanization Plan (\u56fd\u5bb6\u65b0\u578b\u57ce\u9547\u5316\u89c4\u5212), China\u2019s first official plan on urbanization.

---#Introduction

&gt; \u201c. . . I am of the view that we should allow some regions, some enterprises, some workers and farmers, who because of hard work and good results achieved, to be better rewarded and improve on their livelihood. . . [T]hey will engender powerful demonstrative effects on their neighbors and lead people in other regions, work units to follow their examples. In this way, the national economy will, wave-like, surge forward, with all the people becoming relatively well-off.\u201d\u2014Deng Xiaoping, 1979 (as quoted in Xu and Chen, 2008) [47]

.

&gt; \u201cWe will implement a new type of people-centered urbanization, address the bifurcation between urban and rural areas and within cities, and grant urban residency in an orderly manner to rural people who have moved to cities.\u201d\u2014Premier Li Keqiang (2014) Boao, Hainan, April 10 [17]

China has experienced massive, but uneven, development since Reform and Opening-up began in 1978. For much of the last three and a half decades, the nation saw double-digit annual growth. In only three decades, China has become the second largest economy in the world. Averaging nearly 10 % growth each year, China\u2019s economy has become more market-oriented with a rapidly growing private sector. The National Bureau of Statistics of China estimates that approximately 45,000 rural residents leave daily for cities [22]. For every 1 % increase in annual urban migration, it represents a concomitant population increase of approximately 10 million new urban residents.

One consequence of the reform period\u2019s marked rapid economic development was the swift expansion of Chinese cities: China\u2019s urban population rose from 18 % in 1978 to 54 % in 2013 (Fig. 1). In sheer numbers, China\u2019s total urban population increased from 172 million in 1978 to 731 million in 2013 [22]. The largest urban migration in history is currently place in China as a majority of citizens have moved from rural to urban areas\u2014and will continue to do such for at least the next two decades or more [32]. The result of rapid urbanization is greater spending, per capita, on constructing urban housing than on healthcare and education combined [14].

The future of China is inexorably an urban one. Within the next 15 years, as many as a billion Chinese\u2014over 70 % of the population\u2014will be living in urbanized areas. In anticipation of this, in March of 2014 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council issued the National New-Type Urbanization Plan (\u56fd\u5bb6\u65b0\u578b\u57ce\u9547\u5316\u89c4\u5212), China\u2019s first official plan on urbanization [46]. The plan emphasizes a \u201chuman-centered and environmentally friendly path\u201d to urbanization over the next decade [18].

China\u2019s future no longer depends only on the economic performance of first tier megacities in the east and along the coast. Urban growth and economic momentum lies as much in China\u2019s second, third, and fourth tier cities as it does in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. Both the CPC and the State Council recognize that in order to sustain economic growth\u2014and to expand the China Dream (\u4e2d\u56fd\u68a6) to the bulk of society\u2014China needs to move from its current capital-intensive, infrastructure investment-based model to a more service-based, consumption model. In the eyes of the Party and the State Council, it is best accomplished as part of a wide-ranging and comprehensive urbanization plan.

In concrete terms, the National New-Type Urbanization Plan will mean urban hukou expansion (primarily in the second through fourth tier cites and through \u201ctownization\u201d), local infrastructure development and investment, and rural land-use reform. For many urban migrants and rural residents likely to be moved, the China Dream via urbanization fulfills Deng Xiaoping\u2019s call for a \u201cmoderately prosperous society\u201d (\u5c0f\u5eb7\u793e\u4f1a) by encouraging the aspirations of those left behind after 35 years of Reform and Opening-up. This paper will assess the role that the China Dream plays in China\u2019s efforts to expand urbanization and enhance China\u2019s efforts at boosting domestic consumption and maintaining social stability.#The China Dream Defined

What exactly is the China Dream? What is the urban version of that dream? How are the two linked to each other? Why is the urbanized version of the China Dream viewed by both the CPC and the State Council as the key to continuing economic growth? Before we appraise the urban portion of the China Dream, it would be helpful to discuss the overall concept, beginning with some scholarly assessments.

In the March 2014 issue of the Journal of Chinese Political Science (JCPS), a number of scholars offered insightful interpretations of the China Dream. For example, Zheng Wang posited that the \u201cChinese Dream of National Rejuvenation\u201d was not and is not a new concept. Zheng noted that the very concept of the China Dream is best interpreted in three, interconnected ways: within its historical context, as a vehicle for enhancing domestic legitimacy, and as a method for disseminating the concept internationally [30].

Within the same special issue of the JCPS, several other authors provided wide-ranging observations about the China Dream. This sweeping discussion is emblematic of the utilitarian versatility of the China Dream, one that serves both Xi and the CPC well. One scholar noted that the China Dream is integral to the development of a comfortable middle class lifestyle, calling to mind Deng Xiaoping\u2019s \u201cmoderately prosperous society\u201d (\u5c0f\u5eb7\u793e\u4f1a) [9]. Another noted that the China Dream is best measured through a comparison of the performance of both the CPC and the state with Japan, Russia, and India in policy areas ranging from government effectiveness, economic confidence, foreign direct investment confidence, intentional homicide, gender gap, international tourism, and global competitiveness [37]. Still another engaged in an intriguing exercise in political hermeneutics by delving into canonical texts and contexts that are co-situated with a particular text under analysis [21]. These varying approaches to interpreting the China Dream underscores, at least among China scholars, and, as we will see later in this discussion, the average Chinese citizen, arriving at a singular definition of the China Dream is a problematic at best.

Through the speeches and writings of Communist Party of China Party Secretary and state President Xi Jinping, the concept of the China Dream appears to be both a ubiquitous and malleable ideological concept. First invoked by Xi in November of 2012 at China\u2019s National Museum of History after becoming General Secretary of the Communist Party of China immediately following the end of the 18th CPC Party Congress, the China Dream has been vigorously promoted by the CPC. In his various public speeches since 2012, Xi has repeatedly emphasized that the China Dream is that of a \u201cgreat rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d (\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u65cf\u7684\u590d\u5174) [41]. He has also emphasized both the domestic and international nature of the China Dream.

While the idea of the China Dream has been positively received domestically, the precise meaning of the China Dream remains open to interpretation outside of China [38]. Is it the \u201cAmerican Dream with Chinese Characteristics\u201d? Is it a reiteration of previous leaders\u2019 pronouncements? Or is it more a broad, ideological concept?

Much like Mao Zedong Thought (\u6bdb\u6cfd\u4e1c\u601d\u60f3) and Deng Xiaoping Theory (\u9093\u5c0f\u5e73\u7406\u8bba), the China Dream follows a path tread by the ideological contributions made by previous leaders over the past 30 years. Typically, these contributions are framed with a particular policy or societal concern in mind: Jiang Zemin\u2019s Three Represents (\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868) sought to make the CPC more representative of Chinese society at large. Conversely, Hu Jintao\u2019s Scientific Outlook on Development Concept (\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u89c2) and Harmonious Socialist Society (\u548c\u8c10\u793e\u4f1a) aimed to address concerns about rising inequality in China [7]. By contributing a new ideological principle, CPC leaders attempt to have an enduring impact on the direction of the Party. In this respect, Xi Jinping is no different by offering the China Dream.

Central to the idea of the China Dream is the concept of rejuvenation (\u590d\u5174). While Westerners often speak of the rise of China, the term rejuvenation is much more preferable among Chinese to describe China\u2019s impressive achievements since Reform and Opening-up as well as future planned development [28]. The use of the word rejuvenation also underscores an important political point: China has returned to greatness and has not, in fact, risen from nothing.

Xi\u2019s China Dream appeals to the emotions of the average citizen, dreams that are often quite simple: a spouse, a home and a future. In this respect, the China Dream is a viable slogan and ideology because it is relatively ambiguous, allowing for interpretation on the part of both the Party and Chinese citizens. In this respect, the China Dream\u2019s power comes not from what it says, but from what it encourages among the average citizen. Recognizing that every Chinese citizen has both hopes and dreams, Xi has tapped into both these by emphasizing the concept of the China Dream.

During the run-up to the annual meeting of the Lianghui (\u4e24\u4f1a)\u2014the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)\u2014GB Times writer Andrew Jones took to the streets of Beijing to get an idea what the China Dream means to the average Chinese citizen on the street. Specifically, he asked a series of people what they thought the China Dream was and what dreams that they held. [15] Whether it was seeking a house, wishing for a happy life, making more money, or even hoping for a girlfriend or boyfriend, Jones found that most people that he asked did, indeed, have their own China Dream.

The China Dreams that Jones found among the average citizen, modest or otherwise, are telling\u2014and suggest that Xi and the CPC made the right choice in demonstrating that the Party is concerned about the average citizen\u2019s aspirations\u2014and, in particular, recognize that the China Dream is likely to be fulfilled through new-type urbanization:

* \u201cMy China Dream is that I can live happily with my family and have a big house and a nice car\u201d
* \u201cTo get more Money!\u201d
* \u201cI hope we can be healthy\u201d
* \u201cMy China Dream is to have a boyfriend\u201d
* \u201cThe China Dream is to empower the country and then its people\u2026everyone is part of the China Dream\u201d

The China Dream slogan channels these aspirations, and allows the average Chinese citizen to believe that their dreams and those of others can be achieved together and shared. In fact, many of those that Jones spoke to made it a point to differentiate the China Dream from the American Dream, going so far as to state that the China Dream was about society and the nation, while the American Dream was much more about the individual [15].

The China Dream also speaks to concerns by the Party\u2019s leadership that the CPC faces existential threats from both corruption and a disconnection from the people. After assuming the leadership of the Party, Xi immediately sought to address these issues by launching a campaign to crack down on corruption, implement a Mass Line campaign to rectify Party cadres, and pursue austerity measures in order to curb extravagance within the Party. Cadres were told to attack the \u201cfour winds\u201d of formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism, and extravagance and to focus on self-purification, self-improvement, self-innovation and self-awareness [42]. Combine this with Xi\u2019s choice of Wang Qishan to head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and it sends a strong message that the China Dream is also a dream of a moral and ethical Party and government, harkening to thoughts of the phrase \u201cServe the People\u201d (\u4e3a\u4eba\u6c11\u670d\u52a1).

While calling for national rejuvenation, the China Dream can be viewed as an aspirational domestic policy driver as much as an ideological statement. It is for this reason that the CPC emphasizes urbanization and townization reforms. During his first address as General Secretary of the CPC, XI referred to the \u201caspirations for a beautiful life\u201d for the Chinese people and made a similar reference during his first address as President of China in 2013 at the National People\u2019s Congress, when he asserted that the Chinese Dream is one of \u201cstrength, prosperity and the happiness of the people.\u201d [41]#The Chinese Urban Dream Defined

If the China Dream is the desire for a spouse, a home, and a prosperous future, those simple, yet powerful dreams will likely be found in an urban area. In this respect, the China Dream is an urban dream as much as it is a dream of national rejuvenation, major power status, or a militarily strong nation. Presuming that the National New-Type Urbanization Plan is successfully brought to fruition, townization and urbanization will drive China\u2019s domestic economic growth and consumption for the next decade and beyond, maintain social harmony, preserve the primacy of the CPC, and fundamentally change the face of the nation [19].

In the decades before Reform and Opening-Up, population in-migration into China\u2019s cities was strictly controlled [20]. Almost all migration during this period occurred as a result of the CPC\u2019s economic policies [3]. Only after Reform and Opening-Up did the market, rather than the state, begin to dictate urban population inflows. Figures 2 and 3 describes the phases of Chinese rural\u2013urban migration since 1949.

Until the early 1980s, rural populations were strictly prevented from entering cities. The introduction of the Household-Responsibility System (\u5bb6\u5ead\u8054\u4ea7\u627f\u5305\u8d23\u4efb\u5236) created a rapid rise in agricultural yields, which, in turn, created labor surpluses in the countryside. That labor pool was then freed to flow into other sectors of China\u2019s economy. While the Household-Responsibility System reform had a positive influence on China\u2019s growth and the livelihoods of its people, it also had a profound, yet wholly unintended consequence: urbanization. By the mid-1980s, national grain yields would eventually depress grain prices, thereby pushing those who formally engaged in agriculture into small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures, as well as into cities. In this respect, the Household-Responsibility System reform was a catalyst, along with other reforms, that not only lifted millions of people out of poverty and averted famine, but set China on an inexorable course toward urbanization. If the China Dream is the desire for a spouse, a home, and a prosperous future, it began with the reforms first implemented in the early days of Reform and Opening-Up.

As China urbanizes, a critical part of the China Dream is the promotion of domestic consumption\u2014primarily household consumption\u2014in order to create a more stable and sustainable economy. Both the CPC and the State Council believe that massive urbanization over the next decade can move China away from its current export and investment-driven growth model, which it now considers unsustainable [4, 12].

Officially, there are over 730 million urban dwellers in China. However, roughly 200 million Chinese urban dwellers are not truly urbanized. Rather, they are migrants, who do not possess an urban hukou (\u6237\u53e3\u7c3f) household registration. In order to accomplish real urbanization and sustained economic growth\u2014and their own version of the China Dream\u2014migrant workers will need to become full urban residents.

That requires creating a system that offers them an urban hukou\u2014something that the National New-Type Urbanization Plan proposes. Some suggest that this may lead somewhere after 2020 to the eventual abolition of the hukou system altogether [45]. According to the China Association of Mayors and UN-Habitat, there were 287 cities at and above the prefecture level, 367 cities at county-level, and 19,322 towns. By the end of 2013, China had 657 administratively designated cities, including 4 municipalities directly under the central government, 15 sub-provincial cities, 270 prefecture-level cities and 368 county-level cities, where the total area of administrative regions of the cities at various levels accounted for about half of China\u2019s land area. The number of the designated towns also increased to 19,881. Among the 289 cities at or above prefecture level, there were 127 cities with the year-end total population of over 1 million and 14 cities with the year-end total population of over 4 million [39]. Using data from the National New-Type Urbanization Plan, Table 1 describes the indicators and targets of the plan: as the level of urbanization gradually increases, the position and role of China\u2019s urban economy will increasingly play a pivotal role in national economic development.

Urbanization is an important force in industrialization and job creation. Although urbanization has played a major role in stimulating economic growth since Reform and Opening- Up, it has also posed some serious problems environmentally, particularly air, water, and solid waste pollution, land use and land resource allocation, which are now viewed by the Chinese government as an obstacle to sustainable economic growth. China now has an urgent need to address environmental protection issues while attempting to pursue sustainable economic growth [10].#Hukou Reform and the Urban China Dream

&gt; \u201cAllow residents to see the mountains, view the rivers and remember their past.\u201d

&gt; \u2013 Report of the 2013 Central Urbanization Work Conference [11]

Urbanization and townization are integral parts of the China Dream. Among the priorities of urbanization is turning migrant workers into urban citizens, which requires a fundamental change to the hukou system [38]. Granting as many as 200 million rural migrants currently living in urban areas full residency rights will be a monumental task and require a major overhaul of the hukou system.

Scholars and policy makers alike have blamed the hukou system for China\u2019s lower-than-average rate of urbanization [5]. Because of the hukou system, the actual rate of urbanization in China is only 36 %\u2014the nominal urbanization rate is 54 %. Of the 730 million people living in urban areas, over 200 million are rural migrants who are, in terms of their citizenship rights and economic opportunities, not officially considered urban dwellers. Without legal urban residency rights, a rural migrant laborer has to pay tuition to educate his or her children. Migrants cannot get health insurance coverage or retirement benefits provided by the government, and have little, if any, means or incentive to buy an apartment. In this respect, the hukou system limits the social mobility of rural migrants and their children [35]. It also restrains economic consumption because migrants must use a significant portion of their income to pay for public services out of pocket.

Fortunately, the CPC has identified hukou reform as a top priority in the National New-Type Urbanization Plan. According to the plan, rural migrants currently employed and living in towns and cities with populations less than 3 million will have an opportunity to gain full residency rights by 2020. While the hukou will remain in effect in cities with populations over 3million for the immediate future, the hukou reform plan extends the opportunity to pursue the urban China Dream to literally millions of citizens [1].

One aspect of the urban hukou reform raises issues that may very well place even greater financial strain upon local government resources. According to a report issued by the World Bank and the Development Research Center of the State Council, extending full urban hukou residency rights to millions of migrants may cost, on average as much as \u00a5100,000 RMB ($16,400 U.S.) per migrant [38, 40]. While this could conceivably be spread over a number of years, settling 20 million migrants per year into urban areas\u2014as the new urbanization plan envisions\u2014entails an annual estimated outlay of \u00a550 billion RMB ($8.2 billion U.S.) in additional social services [5]. The aim is to have 60 % of China\u2019s population living in cities by 2020 will likely require as much as \u00a51 trillion RMB be spent on transforming shanty towns into urban areas.

Some scholars, such as Wallace [36], note that the CPC has encouraged the development of the West and China\u2019s interior in an effort to spread urbanization, growth, and wealth outside of a few coastal megacities. Wallace argues that these efforts are, in part, attempts to separate the perception of China from the perception of Beijing or Shanghai. Developing Xian, Kunming, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Wuhan provides examples of successful urbanization in second and third-tier cites, demonstrating that these cities, rather than first-tier cities, can and will serve as symbols for the China Dream [25, 26, 36].

While there is a broad consensus for substantive hukou reform, it is both unrealistic and detrimental to social stability, to suggest that the hukou system should be dismantled instantly [27]. Conversely, it is neither desirable nor practical to pursue a glacially slow pace of hukou reform if the CPC is to fulfill its promise of the China Dream for rural migrants and residents [31]. Thinking in pragmatic terms, phasing out the hukou system over the next decade or so is a relatively reasonable and workable solution. It is also a desirable solution because many, if not most, of the rural migrants have aspirations to stay in cities [29]. They are better educated than their parents, are far more aware of their rights and the unsatisfactory conditions in which they live, and are the ones most likely to benefit from the National New-Type Urbanization Plan [24].

Reforming the hukou system could fulfill the China Dream in several ways by increasing labor productivity, reducing income inequality, and accelerating urbanization. Despite China\u2019s relatively high level of rural\u2013urban migration, it is still below what could and should be expected, given China\u2019s size and income level [8]. A lack of an urban hukou creates a situation where migrants not only cannot access public services; they remain tied to the rural areas that they left behind. Ultimately, this discourages people from seeking higher incomes in the cities, while keeping rural labor productivity and wages low [23, 48].

It is this concern about seeking higher incomes that drives the CPC and State Council\u2019s push for urbanization. As a report jointly issued by the World Bank and the Development Research Center of the State Council (DRC) in 2012 notes, China can improve not only the lives of rural migrants, but drive economic growth through townization and urbanization [39]. Reforming the hukou by linking public services to place of residency rather than to place of origin, rural\u2013urban migration will be easier, thereby opening up economic opportunities in the cities [2, 13]. Additionally, recognizing that the present hukou system prevents economic growth and is a major source of China\u2019s rural\u2014urban income inequalities today will drive China\u2019s urbanization plans [8].

The CPC and State Council are obviously well aware of these issues, hence the move toward hukou reform as evidenced by a report released by the Central Urbanization Work Conference (CUWC) following a meeting of the CPC\u2019s 18th Central Committee in December of 2013, headed by President Xi Jinping. The work report reaffirmed China\u2019s commitment to the new urbanization strategy that will ideally drive economic growth for the next decade and beyond [44].#Urbanization is the Key to Domestic Growth and the Chinese Dream

Most advanced industrial economies are highly urbanized. Urban hubs and megaregions are both engines of consumption and innovation in those countries. Urbanization has long been seen by the CPC as the key to unlocking China\u2019s domestic consumption demand, and thus to providing a steady source of growth for China\u2019s economy. In early 2012, Premier Li Keqiang wrote in Qiushi (\u6c42\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7f51): \u201curbanization has the greatest potential for boosting domestic demand.\u201d [16] Li estimated that \u201cevery rural resident who becomes an urban dweller will increase consumption by more than \u00a510,000 RMB (approximately $1,587 U.S.).\u201d It is far from surprising that the potential to improve and increase domestic consumption was irresistible to China\u2019s leaders as they sought to rebalance the country\u2019s economy [33].

China\u2019s new urbanization plan attempts to create an open and innovative economy by urbanizing a substantial portion of the floating migrant population. How China deals with the legacy of rural\u2013urban income disparity will go a long way in determining the ultimate success of the China Dream: closing the rural\u2013urban wealth gap by gradually expanding the urban Chinese middle class through stable domestic economic growth and consumption. Closing the wealth gap is a formidable task and a serious concern for the CPC and the State Council.

A concern arises here: can the China Dream meet the rising expectations for the urban life that rural migrant populations currently residing within urban area that they feel entitled to? That this is a key question is evidenced by the importance that the CPC has placed on implementing the National New-Type Urbanization Plan. In December of 2013, the Central Urbanization Work Conference (CUWC) prepared the policy direction that would lead to the release of the National New-Type Urbanization plan in March of 2014. Calling for \u201chuman-centered urbanization\u201d (\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u57ce\u9547\u5316), it means to make rural migrants fully urban residents.

The plan took 3 years to develop and involved intensive collaboration across both the CPC and the state. The effort was headed by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and joined by 12 other major government ministries [20]. The CPC clearly believes that a national-level urbanization policy will help fuel the domestic consumption needed to reduce the economy\u2019s dependence on investment and exports. Based on the CPC and State Council\u2019s emphasis on achieving the comprehensive outcomes laid out in the plan, it is on the highest level of national plans, approaching the importance of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. In this respect, the National New-Type Urbanization Plan can be seen as a coordinated, top-level effort to increase the population of China\u2019s cities while addressing critical quality of life issues for urban residents [20].

While hukou reform was viewed as a top priority for China\u2019s urbanization efforts, the Central Urbanization Work Conference (CUWC) also listed five additional urbanization reform tasks [33]:

* More efficient land use
* A sustainable funding system
* Better patterns of urbanization
* Holding construction to a higher standard
* Providing stronger management of urbanization as a whole.

These goals were incorporated into the National New-Type Urbanization Plan in March with an assumption that the relocation of current rural residents will occur even as the CPC addresses the needs of people already living in cities.

While China is moving apace to implement the new urbanization plan, the CPC rightly remains cautious about several potentially negative economic impacts of urbanization: ever-expanding local government debt, housing bubbles, and economic imbalances between urban and rural regions. To address these concerns, the CPC has sought to strengthen its management of the urbanization process, by addressing the issue of local government officials\u2019 focus on short-term economic growth and investment projects, viewed by many as detrimental to both public services and social development [33]. A reform announced last year by the Organization Department of the CPC\u2019s Central Committee de-coupled gross-regional production (GRP) assessments and required officials to downplay their \u201cobsession with economic growth and focus more on people's livelihoods and the environment.\u201d [43]

Finding the money for urbanization, townization, and social development will not be easy, given that many local governments have serious issues with debt. However, national pressures from both the Party and the State Council will necessitate that money will be spent (or else) in order accomplish urbanization goals [34]. This will likely mean reforms to the budgetary process, the social security system, and the land management system in order to allow market mechanisms to play the decisive role in allocating land resources. Both the National New-Type Urbanization Plan and the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC\u2019s \u201cDecision on Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\u201d document stated all of these reforms [6].

These reforms can be implemented gradually in order to reduce the impact on both the central and local governments\u2019 budgets, making reform more manageable. What is needed now in order to fully implement new urbanization and fulfill the China Dream for millions of people is political will. Party and government officials alike at all levels must have the resolve to undertake these bold reforms and not be frightened by overstated claims regarding the potential costs of those reforms.#Conclusion

Urbanization is an important\u2014if not critical\u2014part of the China Dream. Turning migrant workers into urban citizens will require fundamental changes to the scope and nature of China\u2019s urban experience, from hukou reform to massive relocation of rural populations into Tier-2, Tier-3, and Tier-4 cities. China\u2019s urbanization is, in many ways, an unprecedented success. Since Reform and Opening-up in 1978, China\u2019s course of rapid urbanization and economic transformation over the past three decades has lifted more than 500 million people out of poverty, in rural and urban areas alike. More than 250 million migrants moved to the city in search of a better life for their families. Promoting shared prosperity through the China Dream and smart urbanization is the next logical step.

If China is to address rural\u2013urban income inequality and avoid issues related to social stability, then implementing the National New-Type Urbanization Plan is key to resolving or improving these issues. Future Chinese urbanization will be characterized not by an expansion of megacities (\u90fd\u5e02\u82b1), but by growth in rural towns and small cities (\u57ce\u9547\u5316). In this respect, the Party will seek to take the cities to the rural populace, rather than bringing the rural populace to the cities [28].

Expanding the China Dream to the bulk of Chinese society can and will change China in fundamental ways. Within the next 15 years, as many as a billion Chinese will be living in urbanized areas. In this respect, the future of China is inexorably and permanently urban. China\u2019s future no longer depends only on the economic performance of first tier megacities in the east and along the coast. The China Dream will play a critical role in determining the CPC\u2019s efforts at expanding urbanization, enhancing efforts to boosting domestic consumption, and to maintain social stability.Click on the link and close the previous tab.Falun gong got chased away you seeOMG we don't know anything about US's Gini coefficient either since it's just an estimate!

You know what, let's just stop all economic analysis since it is fake and we don't know anything about the economy!

People's Daily reporting that the Gini coefficient is 0.73 in 2012 is indication enough that inequality in China is on the rise. Believe that figure or not, the real figure is definitely not below 0.3. The whole point of the figure is to get an idea of the situation in China, not to believe that the figure is 100% correct.

You know, you could also argue that GDP is not indicative of anything too, since people have different ways of calculating GDP. Let's just stop using GDP as a metric from now on then!

Economics may not be a hard science but it still has its purpose.I did not define anything; perhaps you should be more precise in your wording.

My comment was a value judgment, not a hard claim. It's my opinion: take or it leave it.Speaking of which, Ufopaedia is down intermittently lately, so if it's down for anyone, I uploaded a mirror to your link: http://puu.sh/lPhDw.jpgI think it's Slaughterhouse A? UFOpaedia is down right now so can't link a pic yet, but if it comes online again, is it this one? http://ufopaedia.org/index.php?title=File:SlaughterhouseA_3_(EU2012).pngHonestly early floaters are just a grind. The more strategies I hear about dealing with floaters, the more scenarios (and memories) I can think of where they wouldn't work. You are in April. You have what..? Laser Rifles (late April), Alloy Plating...Flashbangs....lousy +/-2 scatter rockets...that's it.

You simply don't have enough inventory to deal with them with 100% reliability. In the midgame you have Mimic Beacons for Heavy Floaters where you can buff to 100% chances. You have chem and psi grenades to lower the Muton Elites to 1% hit chances on you. You have Psi Panic to completely render an Aircobra harmless. You don't have that luxury in April.

Retreating out of LOS? Well, it isn't 100% guaranteed that Floaters will land when they don't see you.

Rockets? Well, it isn't 100% guaranteed that Floaters bunch up together for you to kill.

Flashbangs? Well, they can fly.

In April the largest pod size should still be at around 4 IIRC. 4 Floaters is the maximum threat you can face in April outside of landed UFOs. Others have already gave some great ideas that you should consider seriously. My suggestion is to recognize that they are pretty far from foolproof unlike in the midgame when you can start to employ near-foolproof strategies, but that's probably the best you can get in April. That means, while retreating outside of LOS, prepare for the marginal possibility that they will not land but continue flying. So don't retreat back into a corner and expect them to land only to be disappointed that they are flying and now having only 40% shots while having nowhere to retreat further to. Instead, as an example, retreating and steadying will help you deal with potential flying problems. Floater AI is stupid majority of the time, but when it isn't it will surprise you, so definitely prepare for the worst case scenario.

Depending on your difficulty, April Floaters have 55~65 aim. Halfway into April you will start seeing Floater leaders (a 50% chance to roll one such Floater for each Floater pod starting from ~April 10) who can get Covering Fire, so be very wary when shooting at a Floater. Floater Autopsy is a long way away, so you have no way to check if a Floater has Covering Fire in April from seeing their perks. However, Floater leaders with Covering Fire are *always* named **Floater Sentry**. If you see a Floater Sentry, that Floater *will* have Covering Fire, so precaution is needed in dealing with that. Covering Fire triggers on many many bizarre things such as using a medikit, so be extremely careful here. A way to disable their Covering Fire is to shoot at it with a scout in cover. Lightning Reflexes will trigger on such an action. It is not safe to trigger a Covering Fire with anyone else most of the time: the Floater will have 10~20% chance of hitting someone through full cover with Covering Fire. A quick way to see if a Floater in April has Covering Fire is to just look at its HP. On Normal and Classic, all normal Floaters have 5 HP, but a Covering Fire Floater will always have 6 HP. On Brutal and Impossible, that's 6 and 7 respectively. If you see a Floater with more than 1 HP than all his brethren, expect Covering Fire. It's certainly faster than looking through their names on F1.

Suppression in full cover against Floaters is reasonably effective in April. At this point of the game, a flying Floater has 85 aim due to elevation bonuses (75 on Normal, 80 on Classic). A gunner suppressing a flying Floater with elevation bonuses from *full cover* can expect the Floater to have only around 10% chance of hitting him (~0% on Normal, 5% on Classic). Note that a flying Floater does not automatically gain a +20 aim bonus in flight. They have to be significantly higher than you to gain that bonus. A flying floater very close to the ground will not have this aim bonus. A suppressor will usually be bait for other Floaters, so you should put your suppressing gunner in full cover. Other non-suppressed Floaters in flight will have ~40% chance of hitting your gunner through full cover (30 on Normal, 35 on Classic). Half cover only makes it worse, so avoid suppressing from half cover where possible.

Floaters have 13 mobility in April (12 on Normal), which converts to 8 tiles (7 on Normal). A Floater will always advance for a flank within 8 tiles if there is no apparent danger (e.g. overwatch/suppression), and will sometimes advance if there is some form of opposition. That means while fighting them, make sure they cannot flank you. In a tight scenario, it may be wise to count the tiles and see if it's within 8-tile-range for the Floaters to flank (F2 camera orientation is helpful for this).

Floaters naturally get the Evasion bonus whenever in flight, and this can be seen with their half cover shield icon beside them. This grants them 30 defense even if they're barely hovering above the ground while technically in flight. Thus, overcoming that defense buff is crucial in helping XCOM secure a hit. Ways to do this include luring them to land (such as going out of LOS to confuse the AI) and thus totally negating the 30 defense bonus, or to use aim range bonuses to your advantage (shotguns have a higher aim climb at close range than other weapons, so a shotgun 1 tile away from a Floater has a very high chance to hit), or to bring equipment/pick perks that increase your aim against Floaters (such as SCOPEs giving +8 aim, or Deadeye giving +15 aim if the Floater is flying).

Once April is over Floaters will start to become more and more trivial. What you're facing right now is the April difficulty spike, so don't worry. It gets a bit easier after April.

Also all this only applies for April. Once you start seeing Floater Raiders or whatever all this goes out of the window.That I like my Jaeger more than my Pathfinder is probably evidence enough that they are better IMO.

But to be exact, I'm expecting a Jaeger to deal ~100 damage in one turn with help from 1~2 soldiers in a regular scenario, or ~60 damage without help. I expect a Pathfinder to deal ~70 damage in a regular scenario without help. Both Jaegers and Pathfinders fall off sharply when they face mechanicals, where you'd expect ~40% lower damage contribution. Jaegers are better if you help them (the help required isn't huge, just some cover destruction and holo-targeting high defense targets), but Pathfinders can do their job well by themselves.

Most crucially, Jaegers can cleanup Heavy Floaters. Pathfinders can't.I misclick so often resulting in horrible scenarios it has made me seriously consider going back to Bronzeman mode. I also accidentally reload sometimes because of pressing "R" instead of "E". 

I backup my Ironman save before each mission, but I've only reloaded twice: one because of a Chryssalid pod teleporting on top of me, activating, and injecting 4 of my soldiers during a terror mission, the other just due to a regular glitch where one of my soldier spawned outside the map.

As for save scumming, might I recommend Bronzeman Mode instead? It's a better way to learn how to go about a mission IMO. Save scumming teaches you how to deal with one single engagement. When I was bronzemanning a while ago it taught me how to deal with a mission as a whole.I'm assuming you're not playing on Long War? Then I'm assuming the guy you're talking about is Zemalf? AFAIK I couldn't see any trace of save scumming, but he might have campaign scummed (meaning starting a new campaign again and again until he sees a good start). I don't know. But I'm 70% confident he did not save scum.

&gt; Ok, really? Floater not shooting, not throwing a nade and crippling 3 of your guys, but simply going in the open, then going in the open again between all 3 of them, so they all have a perfect shot? Seems legit.\ufeff

First off, Floaters can't throw grenades (Not sure if they can in EU, but they can't in EW). Second off, on urban maps, Floaters will tend to take ground cover. Occasionally they start off landed without cover, but it's rare. Finally, Floaters without vision on any of the soldiers will not take optimal choices in engagement. That means, yes, running into the open without cover.

The same mechanics he utilized is only more exposed in LW.Glad to know it worked out for you :)

If you have someone with Disabling shot, they also work great against Sectopods.I'm immensely bored in the lategame right now doing crashed scouts/raiders...even crashed terror ship/assault carrier missions over, over, and over again just so I can get enough elerium for EMP cannons, to the point I'm tempted to just *killaliens* every mission. Bored of seeing the same aliens in every mission honestly. It is not only boring but also exhausting. Can't wait for XCOM 2. The only part that is fun is torturing 1 HP mutons, or when you accidentally get into a sticky situation involving 2 L9 pods.

Long War has a great early and mid game, a fun lategame, and a horrendously boring post-lategame (once you start having to plan to shoot down Overseers). Every lategame equipment costs way too much and it's ironically optimal to *not* build plasma weapons. This is not only unintuitive but also sucks away the fun. I'm only building Plasma stuff and Fusion Lances right now in April because it's fun to use them, but the grind to get them is oh-so-dreadfully-boring. There is seriously too little incentive for me to want to experiment with shadow armors etc because of the high costs.

So yeah, playing LW in Year 2 does the opposite of dampening my excitement for XCOM 2.Once alien resources go down the game becomes easy but at the same time you will starve for resources.It would make certain parts of certain maps very very awkward to engage in. Some roadway maps will be hell if the enemy goes into a position that can't be destroyed.By plasma weapons I mean soldier plasma weaponry: plasma rifles, etc. It's a huge waste of resources to build them if you just want to end the campaign as early as possible. You can make do with Pulse, or even Gauss if you want to.

I personally don't do that because it's a boring way to play the game.I'm only talking about soldier plasma weaponry, and I never mentioned researching Pulse in the original first post. The fastest way to reach Temple Ship is to stick with Gauss, research Plasma cannons, yes I agree, but my point is that, it's optimal to not build plasma rifles etc. I'm talking about the fact that building endgame equipment is not optimal strategically if you want a fast end. Not talking about research.

Let me explain my post:

In my game I'm doing everything because I don't care for a fast end, but I think LW is designed in such a way as to make endgame equipment too expensive and unappealing to build. That's what I'm talking about.

I also mentioned *optimal* in the sense that not building plasma rifles, not building blaster launchers, not building shadow armor is better. It makes endgame equipment nearly useless.Mutons start with carbines which grant them (6/6/6/7) base damage and (66/71/76/76) aim. They later upgrade to (8/8/8/9) base damage and (60/65/70/70) aim.

good story m8Both perks have their utilities. I rely on DT Snipers a lot on maps where I need to shoot through indestructible full cover.

VPT and BeO granting +3 damage each on crits is extremely strong. VPT is strong enough for me to decide on skipping the 10% crit from PS.

This is not the case for Ranger vs. Sharpshooter. The +1.5 damage is small when considering you're doing ~21 damage. The purpose of Sharpshooter is not to gain damage; it is to ensure that a precision shot has a 100% chance of critting mechanized and nonexposed targets with proper equipment and combat bonuses. Without Sharpshooter it's much harder to get a 100% aim/crit on a Mechtoid or a Sectopod, or a Muton Elite in indestructible full cover. The point of Sharpshooter is to have a guarantee that you'd deal 21 damage 100% of the time rather than 22.5 damage 90% of the time. Having a squad capable of 100% aim/critting targets is a huge game changer in expanding many options for your squad. Knowing you will at least deal ~16 damage to a target, rather than having a 10% chance to fail and only deal 10, allows you to plan your engagement in such a way as to confidently explore more options knowing that the 35 HP Mechtoid will be eliminated with DT.

Giving up Ranger on the other hand means losing more potential 1HKOs. At an expected damage of around 21, the DT snipers damage hovers around many key HP ranges. Elites have around 25 HP, Ranger really helps with 1HKO. Heavy Floaters are easily 1HKO'd by DT crit snipers already, even without Ranger, since they're at around 20, but Ranger ups the reliability. DT snipers with Ranger has a higher chance of DT-killing a low level Mechtoid without chem. For a lot of other alien types, Ranger vs. no Ranger barely makes a difference. Low level aliens can be killed easily regardless. Ethereals most often have HP that are in the range of 30~40, which is in the range of DT killing, but not as high as Mechtoids as to give Ranger a distinct advantage. Sectopods and Cyberdiscs without chem can't typically be relied on by a non-GLR crit sniper.

LW is really not about which build provides the most damage. If it is I would bring 4 crit Jaegers and 4 crit Pathfinders on every single missino.Well... you are already doing spam restarts, so well, you're probably already employing the only practical solution.It's just a matter of kill the Ethereal on sight.Yep.

If anything, they should retain the original Impossible style of difficulty in combination with difficulty affecting AI. There are always players who like to develop strategies based on understanding AI and finding new ways to abuse mechanics. You see that in CIV, you see that in EUIV, and since XCOM is a strategy game you'll see that in XCOM too.

I think it's always interesting to just put a difficulty out there where you don't expect anyone to even be able to past through the first month. The results will always be surprising and give everyone insight into new strategies and help developers find out ways why their AI doesn't work in different situations.It was pointed out in comments, but it's up to you whether you want to delete it.For Windows, the default location is

You can always just memorize all the perks. It's not that difficult. I barely check perks now.Only leaders get Tac Sense, and most commonly it would be HFloaters and MElites. You see a 77% shot on it vs. 97% shot on everyone else and it should be obvious.

All Leviathans get Reactive Targeting Sensors. See a 54 HP Mechtoid at 500 AR? That means RTS is there.

All "Destroyers" get HEAT Ammo. See a Heavy Floater Destroyer? That means HEAT Ammo is there.

There is barely any need to check perks once you've memorized them. I like that XCOM 2 is *not* letting you see the perks because the best part about LW is being surprised by the perks the first time and desperately trying to salvage the situation. Being able to see what an alien has acquired through research via F1 after autopsies ruins the immersion. Why would you know that they installed a RT sensor on the Mechtoids? The game should test how players adapt on the fly.I wish they increased squad size and increased pod sizes.

I really wish there are more sparse UFO maps. I like those the most.It's the atmosphere that I like the most. The feeling of exploration and venturing into the unknown. Also meld.Well, I'm more talking about changing 3 pods of 3 to 4 pods of 6."Such a brute, just like my predecessor" \*wipes shirt and shakes head*Doubt it. The original meaning of *avatar* is the appearance of a deity. It is far more likely game lore use names that reference the word's original mythological meaning and not reference a movie or a comic or something.

For example, Attack on *Titan* is completely unrelated to the Titans in World or Warcraft, which in turn is completely unrelated to the film Clash of the Titans.

It makes sense that Ethereals are seeking humans as vessels from the game lore itself, but justifying it from the name being similar to other pop culture titles is erroneous.In the Avatar movie they literally zap humans into Navi.https://books.google.com/books?id=1oqTYiPeAxMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=False

While mods generally help a game get more sales and prolong its longevity, there is also the dilemma that the original dev may not be able to compete with free mods when pushing out expansions and DLCs.

Are you serious? They look way more un-genericEvery time someone tells HKers they are racist they attempt to defend it or to say "there's a reason for our racism".

I've lived in HK and I know the situation there. I don't even care about stereotyping or racism that much, but I despise HK hypocrisy that they are better than mainlanders when they are really not that much better. Personal attacks on anyone who disagrees are everywhere in HK social media circles, whereas similar attacks are universally derided in the West.Just speak English in HK, and if they don't understand you, pretend using a broken Canto accent ;)I lived in HK for a long time, and I am pretty certain HK is more racist than the West.

The things I can find on Facebook in HK circles and things I hear from friends are nowhere near what I've seen or experienced in America.

Things like:

- Mainlanders are locusts

- LOL Filipinos are all hobos on Sundays

- Why do Indians always smell like curry and never wash themselves?

- We need another Japanese invasion to kill all the mainlanders

- Shouting "Bat lau dung laai" repeatedly after knowing someone came from Vietnam

I'd imagine these statements are universally derided in the West outside of certain special groups.

I know this sounds harsh but I would never want to go back to HK again unless I live in an expat/Westerner bubble and refuse to interact with locals. I also wish I never learnt Cantonese.

I'm sorry if you are offended but I'm very sick of HK racism and the attempt to justify such racism.

---

You know, some HKers also say they are more civilized than mainlanders, and while that is True based on minutiae details like lining up or not peeing on the floor, HKers aren't really far from mainlanders given the things they say when no one's looking. I'd imagine they wouldn't say these things to an expat or a Westerner./u/komnenos is one of the milder posters in /r/China. I've never seen him writing anything that is anywhere close to racist speech.

I can confirm that because I'm one of the shitposters there ;)

Left /r/china because there are no interesting discussions there anymore - too monotonic. And I can't be half-assed to post stuff there anymore.No Ulm in Siberia 0/10/r/clashofclansrecruitI've never met such people, and I consider myself lucky for that.

Just today I was talking to a transfer student from Tsinghua about the Sino-Indian conflict (I honestly don't think it constitutes as a "war"), and the treatment of Tibet and there were scarcely any unpleasantness.

Then again I do go out of my way to avoid sensitive topics with people I do not know well because I used to make people upset and feel "threatened" sigh.Well, the people I talk to are from the top ends. I know two transfer undergrads from Tsinghua, one from Peking U, two grads from Tsinghua, and one postgrad from Fudan. I also have a family member with a PhD from Tsinghua.

All of them say that American style education is better.

I may be an undergrad only, but I do talk to people from academia because of my family background. There is a bias though - the grads, postgrads and professors I know are all primarily STEM and economics. And I don't talk to professors much because they're old, so it's usually them telling me their life stories, which I do readily absorb.

Either way, don't take what I say seriously. I will almost definitely change my mind one year later.

What's interesting is that whenever I say this people get upset but when they say the same thing everyone nods in agreement.Next time don't get yourself in that kind of trouble. The concept of owing and doing favors for someone is complete hogwash and needs to be cleansed.I mean we've probably seen multiple incarnations of the post but I don't think we should ban them yet.This is so adorable :)If you view extra and intro -version as a spectrum, it is possible for one to fall somewhere near the middle - an ambiverted individual. Someone who want to talk with other people while also wanting some alone time.Tsinghua has a wonderful engineering facility, immense funding from the government, and top tier professors (within China) including, from what I know from a friend, a Turing Award winner teaching in the faculty, etc....

It is not a bad school. But it is definitely nowhere near the top schools in America IMO. The speculation that Chinese academics participate in group citations for the purpose of increasing rankings needs a citation. From what I understand, people in Tsinghua are obsessed with publications, and hence spam a huge ton of papers with somewhat poor quality. Since the amount of researchers in a specific field is often low, therefore they cite people within the circles for publications, because they can't be bothered to find better sources, do original research etc., and not because they actually want to cite them. This means indirectly climbing the ranking system because the US News methodology puts a rather heavy weight on publications and citations.

Anyways, most people wouldn't dream of saying that Tsinghua is at the same level as MIT, for instance. At least the Tsinghua graduates and transfers I know don't think that.&gt; it's just memorization and cramming

Yep. Every single Chinese grad/postgrad/whatever I've met said they really hated this system. It shuts down a person's creative capacity and it's so sad that an entire nation's people are going through this system.To make it less confusing, please use the terms "storage" and "drill" instead because most people use collectors to mean the elixir pumps and gold mines.Does Tina have social anxiety or something?He's building a wall along the Atlantic.so much dramaThis is so sweet :) (\u25e1\u203f\u25e1\u273f) This can be exploited somehow...From what I've heard you're going to masters to get the loot win bonus.Congrats! Now push to 5000 :)OMG! I feel so bad for the Chinese nationals at my university. There was this transfer student who is really shy and it's really nice talking to him all the time. But yet it takes a single asshole making fun of him (*) to make him feel uncomfortable in America :(

(*) A guy knew he's from China and since he can't speak English that well, he proceeded to mock him asking incredibly mundane questions like talking to a child: "Did you go to class today? Good good." "Your English is really good!"

Well, perhaps it isn't easy to see how that's really mean when written in text.

Also, the Chinese students always talk among themselves. I can only join if I myself told them I lived in HK and can speak Chinese.http://puu.sh/l5cRc.jpg

Here's my suggestion.

1. Deploy left cutter drag to wear down BK.

2. Deploy cutter 1.

3. Deploy cutter 2.

4. When CC is lured, deploy BK.

5. Deploy rest of dragons.

6. Deploy balloons.

7. Rage on location shown.

8. Heal on location shown.

9. Wait and rage.

Key points:

- Your BK and left drags should take out at least the mortar to minimize balloons from straying far from the core.

- Balloons have a low speed so deploying them early is fine because there are very little high HP structures in front of the ADs, meaning dragons will get targeted by the ADs early.

- Heal to maintain balloons HP. They will help you get rid of the rest of the defenses.Arabic and Hebrew (I think in this case it's Hebrew) is always written from right to left.This reminds me of the camping on transport roof trick before one day it was patched.http://puu.sh/l5fqx.jpg

1. Deploy giant en route to archer tower to lure the CC out.

2. Place one archer on the builder hut.

3. Kill the CC like how you do it in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbwFnCX0ZfM

4. Clear the gold mines and elixir collectors near the archer tower with archers (while not in range of the archer tower)

5. Deploy dragon

6. Once dragon is targeted by the AD, deploy balloons en route to AD IMMEDIATELY.

7. Deploy the rest of the balloons. &gt; Yet somehow if a Chinese international student whose English is dogshit somehow conned their way into a U.S. university with falsified test scores, essays and letters of recommendation, we are supposed to view them as victims of American arrogance when they get called out on their bullshit?

Take your bad day mood elsewhere. I'm not interested in replying to the same old stereotypes over and over again.

Furthermore you're underestimating the ability of admissions to detect BS from a mile away.Yep.You clearly aren't in touch with the processes of today's admissions. Generic essays produced from the firms are slashed like grass.

Furthermore I doubt you actually know any Chinese international students. The majority I've met are smart and hardworking individuals with less-than-perfect spoken English. That doesn't mean they can't write in English.

If you've actually know people who work in admissions (I do), actually know Chinese international students (I do), assessed a Chinese international student's ability through communication (I did), then come back and repeat the same claim.

Not to mention the communication channels between universities to warn each other of fraud cases and background checks on individuals. There are even rumors of colleges planting spies in hired college essay sites.I'm aware of the brokers who coach students getting into top colleges. In fact, it isn't at all uncommon for students to be hiring them.

It is unfair, because a high income family can more readily get a consultant for admissions. I recall someone I know who had consulting with [this firm](http://theedge.com.hk/admissions-consulting/), which costed 100k HKD. Very expensive.

BUT, these firms do not tell you any *essential information* a normal individual could not know themselves. They grant you an edge, through

- Getting distilled and relevant information vs. sifting through tons of garbage information and speculation on the Internet

- Having connections with admissions alumni from top universities (NO you don't get a free ticket, they don't name drop. Communication with current admissions is forbidden; you only get connections with past admissions). You can still get the same information by reading books and forum posts etc. written by admissions people, or asking the current admissions questions.

- Giving you an idea of the culture of a university, which IMO, is the sharpest edge you can get.

HOWEVER, these brokers, in the interest of protecting their legitimacy, do NOT deal secretly with universities to let people in, or help someone who is going to lie. The number one thing they tell you is to be yourself and be honest. The way to game the (at least US) college admissions system is to be honest and unique, while being consistent during the interview and with test scores, GPA, and ECs. There is no possible way to achieve that by having someone write your essay for you. If you do that you'll be rejected because admissions have worked many years in the industry to be able to detect essay mill products from a mile away.

What these people do is to essentially babysit rich kids by giving them deadlines ("Hey, Jake, give me your second draft for Yale by Friday, okay, and let's go through it together for one hour on Saturday"), telling them things they can all find on the Internet ("The average SAT score of MIT is 2250..."), etc. and occasionally giving them "insider" info which is pretty easy to find like ("UChicago has a gen ed. program that covers philosophy and you can use that in your essay")

Anyone can game the system easily. Collegeconfidential gives many tips on that. Admissions consultants just have years of experience and bring you the distilled and no-BS version. By gaming the system I don't mean getting into schools beyond your capability. What I mean is to get into a school you deserve to get into with a higher-than-average chance.The admissions at my university had little such concern. There is a tendency to avoid Chinese applicants because they do try to commit fraud, but they can easily distinguish between the Chinese committing fraud and those who are honest and unique. Consequently most Chinese international students are actually deserving of the spot they have taken.I know an admissions officer and we have discussed this issue before.I don't *deny* that Chinese students fraud.

What I am *denying* is that admissions lack the capability to detect such fraud. Admissions KNOW that there is such fraud, they preemptively prevent such fraud, be more careful when they read essays from someone from China, reject generic Chinese essays, etc. The admissions officer I know had years of experience in the field. Sure there are always one or two who slips past, but the majority of the Chinese applicants my university accepts are actually deserving of the spot, because the admissions have done a fine job of rejecting fraud cases. Consequently Chinese international students are not people who don't deserve to be in this university which you so want to claim.

There are many alarm bells that come with fraud cases. Inconsistency, for one. Generic essays, for another. I think you don't have enough faith in admissions to detect fraud.

A sure way to test whether a massive volume of fraud cases slip past is to look at the GPA statistics. Chinese nationals have around the same average GPA with us.First of all, if you want to be better at war, I would recommend:

- Unlocking dark spell factory and leveling it up to 2

- Upgrading zap to 5

- Upgrading hogs to 4

You can't do much with this base other than a dragloon (9/9) from 2:00.

http://puu.sh/l5j2J.jpg

1. Triple zap AD.

1. Deploy cutter dragons first, wait for them until they get in range of the air defenses.

2. Deploy the rest of the dragons.

3. Once orange X defenses are down deploy balloons as shown.If you miss three arrows, that wouldn't be the case, which is perfectly possible. The delay can potentially take a longer time than the span of two arrows. Assuming an archer fires one shot per second, then missing 1.1 seconds in the beginning is equivalent to missing 3 shots: 1 shot at 180s left, 1 at 179s left, 1 at the last.

However, given that the TH has a significant amount of HP left, I do believe that 22 DPS is an incorrect figure. But with the correct stats, it is still technically possible to achieve the result of a TH8 not dying.&gt; Lovaas and others noted that, as widespread as cheating may be, most Chinese students who are accepted to U.S. institutions apply honestly, and tend to do well, which Deupree said points to another reason for increasing vigilance against fraud: \u201cNot just because it\u2019s a bad thing, but because institutions don\u2019t want students to fail.\u201d [source](http://hechingerreport.org/concerns-rise-cheating-chinese-applicants-u-s-colleges/)

I really don't think it's just my university, although I do not have solid data to back that up for other universities. In my university I know the international students do tend to do well. And from what I've seen from articles, other universities also note that Chinese students do well. And it is far harder to commit fraud within a university because it's extremely difficult to find someone to write an academic level essay for you.

This suggests that the amount of fraudulent applicants managing to slip past admissions is lower than what would be the case if we see Chinese students consistently underperforming compared to their peers.

By generic essays I don't mean boring essays that make everyone yawn. I mean essays that are generic and either seem to be "too perfect", doesn't fit one's ECs and transcript, or not sounding like a teenager.

There are many ways for admissions to detect fraud and I really hope people put more faith in them. They are good at what they do seriously.

The College Board is being vigilant by removing China as one of their testing locations, last I checked. (Bravo for their brave decision!) There are many checks in place in admissions, and people are very aware of Chinese fraud. It's not at all easy for them to slip through.&gt; The point is, if they didn't cheat, they wouldn't have a chance.

Are you for real?

Tons of international applicants around the world with less than perfect spoken English get in. They have an accent and they don't understand slang that well, but that doesn't mean they can't write an essay. Wtf?

That Chinese international students get a comparable average GPA with Americans is indication enough that the majority of them didn't cheat their way in and are qualified. Unless you think you can just cheat through university.

There is also the fact that a lot of universities accept Chinese who attended international schools or have lived overseas for a while. The ones that truly lived as a local in China are rare. They are not inept.

Either way, I'm willing to accept that perhaps my university is an exception rather than the norm. As I've said I don't have solid data to back up claims for other universities, but I do know that very little fraud gets through at mine. I've read some posts from admission officers in other universities and they do have mechanisms to prevent fraud, but I do not know their GPA stats to know whether they are working.I have NEVER said admissions fraud does not exist.

I'm saying admissions is capable of preventing fraud from getting through. They have so many years of experience that they are simply capable of detecting BS within 2 minutes of reading an applicant's profile. They are automatically more vigilant when reading a profile from a Chinese applicant, and any slight indicator of fraud automatically gets rejected. I really don't think Chinese applicants can get away with fraud.Um... r/am and its variants sometimes claim that too.

So I guess CCP indoctrination spreads wide.

Either way I'm making this post really because I dislike r/am making bullshit claims like this.Tumblrinas are child murderers confirmed.I don't even feel comfortable saying that I have Impostor Syndrome...I seriously doubt that.

Anyways, too busy today to be arguing this, but I do concede you have a point. If I have the time I will talk to the officer I know since he's in my house anyways.

I still think it is almost impossible for one to maintain a decent GPA through cheating. There are presentations to do, essays required at a highly rigorous level in highly specific fields, finals (you can't cheat proofs or a program) and midterms, etc.

I know highly talented Chinese nationals with crappy spoken English but decent essay writing skills. I simply cannot accept the claim that most Chinese international students are cheaters unless I see convincing proofs: 

- Average Chinese international student GPA is lower

- A sample essay from an essay mill

- Independent proof that they manage to send an underqualified applicant to a university consistently at a 80% success rate

I have not insinuated that the average Chinese applicant can write an essay as well as Americans. I have said that some of them are capable of doing that. Those who are in the top 1%, who went out of their way to read classics and study English rigorously, rewrite their essays a thousand times with non-fraud help from consultants.Anon is blackThis is so fucking autisticWhy would they do that when they are family and friends who have also went to the US?You are right that's a better plan.This one is much harder and I can't offer you a 3-star advice sorry.What??

It is up to the user to learn the mechanics well and learn how to deal with issues like that.This is so far from the truth. I know biologists (one guy researching genetic diseases) who believe in microevolution and intelligent design, for one. They are rare, but not "0 out of 10". 10 out of 10 is a vast hyperbole.

Why is reddit supporting vastly inaccurate claims like this? Boggles my mind. Scientists are as fallible as engineers.Yeah I was used to the early b15 early game.More interesting than your monotone. Go back to SyriaIs it that hard to Google itDestroyers replaced by raiders? Definitely do not remember that and that's an awesome change!Post some insightful or informative discussions then. It bores the hell out of people but well, it's the Internet, not a forum with professors chiming on all issues.You should perhaps use clearer language then, because "What the fuck is microevolution" does not convey whatever you're trying to say well.

Microevolution makes perfect sense unless you're trying to deny the existence of it. It's like a high school concept and I doubt you really don't know what it means. So are you trying to say believing in microevolution and intelligent design simultaneously does not make sense? Then argue with the scientist, not me. I pointed out that such people exist, but you somehow think that all scientists have the exact same beliefs, which is frankly ridiculous. Physicists have misconceptions of biology, and biologists physics. Most scientists study in a narrow field and it is quite possible they have many misconceptions on fields they are not versed in.I disagree that Japan is a creative society.&gt; The concept of "microevolution" as distinct from "macroevolution" makes no sense. One implies the other. It's Zeno shit, it's like saying I can take individual steps but those steps wont' add up to a mile.

Are you a biologist? Do you have a specialization in evolutionary science? If not, perhaps you shouldn't make claims like that.

The best I can offer is that there are debates within the field. One guy I knew who did research on bacterial resistance (closely related with microevolution) told me there isn't conclusive evidence that microevolution leads to macroevolution. Consider the argument that macroevolution is a significant change in allele frequencies but microevolution occurs not necessarily with change in allele frequencies, rather also through other means such as balancing selection. Microevolution does not necessarily lead to macroevolution.

I think people without a specialization in a particular field should not try to tell others what to believe. Evolution is not conclusively proven, and hence more research needs to be done on it to investigate rather than pretending that all is well. I am so thankful academia is above society zeitgeist.

Anyways, this is not to say people don't believe in evolution. This is to say that people don't think the current explanations of evolution is satisfactory. Society should hold its breath and wait for the field to mature before concluding anything.Converting enemy defenses sound fun.

What a weeaboo.Cheating through 4 years is extremely hard in university.

There can be rich kids who cheat in university but they need a significant amount of effort and money to cheat through university.

The probability that all Chinese international students cheat through university successfully is low because most of them can't afford to cheat like this. (Consider finals, midterms, discussion)

Chinese international students have a comparable GPA to Americans

Therefore it is likely that the probability of underqualified students getting in is very low.

The Chinese students here are capable and hardworking. It is unlikely they were underqualified and had to rely on fraud to get in.

Besides, I said

&gt; Sure there are always one or two who slips past

It is far harder to prove that Chinese international students are all fraud cases when they have high GPA, participate well in class (although they do have an accent and speak slower), etc.; the evidence is overwhelmingly to the contrary.

I have not seen a single case of a Chinese fraud case managing through university from any of you here, it isn't a huge concern of admissions, and all of you are just repeating things you've found on the Internet. Based on what I'm seeing in my university and statistics obtained I'm convinced that the probability of Chinese fraud cases getting through is very low.

By the way, if you want to point out other people's logical fallacies, I'd advice you to not do that unless you have clearly dissected an argument. There exists data that backs up the generalization. It is not generalization from limited observations.I'm suggesting a new troop. This argument is incredibly silly. Everyone clearly knows what I mean.The day when people stop asking about cheaters.I have found that sneaking to the left and rushing up to take the high ground seems to be the best way to deal with this LZ.

basically gay / lesbian hentai. It's fucking everywhere in China I wouldn't be surprised if I see it on a bus the next time I visit.Meanwhile Trump is building a Great Wall to stop MexicansSuppression only reduces aim by 30. This is not a lot when you consider that aliens can potentially have 100 aim. Alien AI like to hit the suppressor, which means suppressor should try to defense / HP stack as much as possible and stay in full cover. I personally don't rely on suppression to stop an alien from hitting someone, but use suppression in a way such that the aliens divert targets on a beefier target (usually the gunner) with an aim penalty.In the case that the Outsiders don't come up, you have to take the initiative to go down or to lure them up.

To do this you'll need to make sure some of the doors of the room below are not opened. You could lure them in such a way so that they all go onto one side (do this on the roof, don't go down), then spread your troops so that some of them go in and one of them stays outside. For some reason sometimes the AI does not open the door when moving in and out of them, so in this way the alien on the outside will be trapped. Send your team down, 3 to block the big door, and 1 the small door and surround the lone outsider for an easy kill, then go back up immediately, while holding the small door beside the ladder. Tracking the outsiders can easily be achieved through tile scanning. Watch out for overwatch.

Alternatively you can position yourself vulnerably so that the Outsiders can jump up to flank you while not being flanked. This is a more dangerous strategy but so far I've found that they usually use their yellow move to flank you most of the time.

Even if the outsider pod spawns in the large room, this is still achievable by simply triggering the pod and then dashing all the way onto the roof.

The major downside to this strategy is that there is an LR outsider in early March which can ruin everything; I've seen Outsiders being aggressive and take shots while being flanked. (I don't know when LR outsiders spawn on different difficulties though, so you may not see one).

Result:

http://puu.sh/l7y54.jpgI hate midgame landed research scouts the most; personally I think they are one of the toughest missions there is. Landed transports are less tougher, but I enjoy them because I know I'm going to get lots of resources. In the early game it is better to try to stay outside the ship or go onto the roofs to clear pods. In the mid and late game I just try to roof snipe instead. Either way transport missions is all about triggering as little pods as possible IMO.OF COURSE the civvies run towards the chryssalid after being saved.I would kick that soldier with such horrible stats, or put him in a later-to-be-MEC section.

I personally only value will on Assaults, so that means they must have high HP, high mobility and high will. I usually hire lots of soldiers and kick half of them. My medic psions usually play a supportive psi role so I really don't care that much about will on medics.

If you must, then a psi-medic is a decent choice.I would've done the non-cheese, shredder + explosive + flashbang way were it not for the fact that I only had 4 SPECs ready (2 infantries, 1 sniper, 1 gunner) at the time.

I haven't been on this sub for a long time so I don't know what's been going on.

I don't know the LW difficulties mechanics that well, so I can't comment on that. As far as I'm aware, AR affects leader level chance, but it's been a long time since I looked at AR mechanics. (I do remember installing a mod to check it though).

Edit: found it

&gt; Note that these scaling factors don't affect everything that research affects.
&gt; These only effect the rate at which alien stat upgrades appear, and the capping effect of when alien leaders can appear.
&gt; The do not effect when aliens can appear, when they upgrade pod size, nor anything to do with the interception game.

[source](https://np.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/3a225k/lw_alien_research_speed/cs8p5gd)

I haven't been playing since 15c, so I don't know what has changed.

I also don't know what "capping effect of when alien leaders can appear" means. Does it mean when *any* alien leader of a given species can appear in the game, or when *a certain level* of alien leader of a given species can appear?

Either way I think all difficulties should ~~see an~~ be able to potentially see an LR outsider on a landed transport in early March since there does not seem to be any differences in starting AR across difficulties AFAIK.I mean they've already done that before getting angry and leave.

I imagine that Xi's tech visit is having quite some effect on Google's decisions.They self-censored already while in China. IIRC China wanted them to censor even harder and it broke the camel's back.

[SweetFX settings](http://pastebin.com/7vCD5q6b)I can see how camping on the roof is an uncomfortable strategy, especially since the cover on top is not very good, and any alien can easily flank soldiers on the roof by jumping up. For me, that the LOS on enemies below is horrible is precisely why I camp on the roof. It limits alien's sight on me from below, forcing them to jump up (usually one by one) and hopefully die to overwatch. There is no good cover for them either, meaning they are forcibly flanked, too, which reduces (not eliminate!) the chance for them to fire on you. In many cases, because they don't have sight on you, they dash onto the roof, meaning even if they don't die to overwatch, they will not have an action left. It is a dangerous strategy, but I feel that it is a strategy that disrupts the AI because the AI can *sense* where you are and coordinate their movements based on where you are, but they seem to take cover based on what they see instead.

Either way, I think the breach method is the better method when you have sufficient soldiers to do so. I only really do the roof camping method when I'm forced to, such as in very early March with limited options, or when I have a limping squad.Thanks for the info. Yeah, I didn't know this at all, but now that I do, I agree that this is probably the straw rather than the push from CCP.

Perhaps this is also why Google is returning? Xi agreed to "eliminate" China's hacking activities, so perhaps Google feels confident to return.Since when did S&amp;M become an MSGT perk? Last I played it wasn't. Was it a post-b15d change?

&gt; Anyways:
&gt; 
&gt; I just want to note an interesting use of scouts.
&gt; 
&gt; Some soldier can acid a cover-based organic near the squad, such as a Muton. The scout can Flush and Holo-target the unit, which causes it to move most of the time. This movement usually causes the unit to flank itself because of AI seemingly confused by acid ^(^get ^it? ^get ^it? ^ahahhah) (works with flashbang as well but not as funny). The rest of the squad can kill it easily with the applied holo-targeting.

S&amp;M scouts were absolutely fantastic on terror missions when dealing with Mechtoids and Sectopods last I played. I don't know whether it still works as well right now.

I never use shotguns on Engineers, so I don't think HEAT Ammo is useless on Engineers just because you have a different playstyle. That said, the way I use engineers, I still wouldn't take HEAT Ammo.I can't agree that S&amp;M only has synergy with concealment. It has synergy with Sprinter and LR too.OP is making fun of someone else (not me for a change) with the thread title. He's not actually trying to ask anything.Full base: http://puu.sh/l7JnH.png

My troops: http://puu.sh/l7Jo3.pngYour interceptors have a chance to completely annihilate a UFO rendering no crashed UFO mission.The first terror mission is always the harshest. Good luck.

I actually don't suggest you rely on explosives. Floaters are the real threat in March/April terror missions IMHO, so cautious engagement is better. An AP grenade can make short work of a Chryssalid pod combined with everyone else firing even on Impossible. Your real goal is to deal with the Floaters. That means aim stacking (holo-targeting), early Deadeye troops, suppression, shredder rockets. Absolutely do not waste a rocket on Chryssalids in March/April.

I honestly think Chryssalids are mostly trivial early on (even the L9 Chryssalid is trivial if you know how to deal with it). Floaters are far tougher.

That said, very quickly you'll learn that Chryssalids, while being fairly easy to deal with, are extremely annoying due to their occasional tendency to run away from you and kill civvies, similar to Floaters, but with them spawning a legion of zombies.I would go with Flak. There are so many ways to deal with mechanics but there aren't as many with HFloaters.You only get 2~3 rockets per rocketeer early on (depending on perks and loadout). These are far more worth spent on eliminating floaters.

The reason why I wouldn't waste a rocket on Chryssalids is because they clump together quite often (there are cases where they don't and split off to hunt civvies though), meaning an AP grenade + another AP grenade or shots from everyone would eliminate the Chryssalid pod. Whereas floaters fly and can't be grenaded easily, but could be rocketed.

I would bring:

I have to disagree with this quite strongly. Suppression is much weaker than chem+flashbang and it's quickly outphased in the midgame for me. I only suppress on trivial pods, or when I'm in a prolonged firefight.

With the right build gunners can be a decent midgame HEAT choice capable of helping the assault destroy two Mechtoids.This is the epitome of Facebook pics...

Tieba is now a wasteland with too many microtransactions, too much garbage due to the devs actually encouraging people to get XP points (their form of karma). It's no longer good./r/china - first world problems in China manifested

What next, people not using correct pronouns in Beijing?

For that matter, people keep calling me \u53c9\u6b7b or \u6572\u6b7b. It's not a big deal their mouths aren't genetically developed to pronounce English.dank maymay/r/clashofclansrecruit please.Yep. The airgame when done well can be a huge hitter on the aliens which makes the tactical game easier.LOL nothing to see here anymore mods banned that wiener

Anyways, here it is:

---

Soon China might have quality on their side as well. Many experts and analysts seem to think that if Chinese military spending and production continues, they will be roughly equal to the US in 15-20 years or will at least have closed the gap by a substantial margin.

Technology

China is working on a fleet of supercarriers (Around 4-6 carriers as well as escort/heli carriers) which will allow them to extend their range of operations as well as possibly use the same gunboat diplomacy the US uses. Due to current supply ship constraints, the supercarriers will likely have to work in "hunting packs" of two carriers.

Then there's the new defensive perimeters and early-warning systems they are establishing in the pacific. China is beginning to build up its navy and air force to modern specifications. China has been opting for internal development of jets, rather than purchasing them from Russia, US or other arms manufacturers. There appears to have been espionage conducted as many aspects of their new line of stealth fighters greatly resemble next-gen Russian jets.

China's space program is developing into a very powerful entity that is not useful only for civilian aspects but for military as well. China has the resources to deploy an intelligence network that would rival the US and other large networks. China is also working on so-called "carrier-killers" and anti-ship missiles as well as anti-satellite missiles which could present a large problem as we already have enough debris in orbit to worry about.

Disadvantages in supplies and equipment

One of China's disadvantages is that they give their soldiers so little gear. Average cost to outfit a Chinese soldier is around $2,000, compared to US/Russia and just about any other Western country that spends more around $20,000. This means that radios, compasses, and body armor are scarce. Only elite units or units that are expecting combat or on parade get to wear the fancy gear.

China believes that spending more on equipment will make soldiers feel safer and less likely to fight as hard which I think is a stupid strategy that will get people killed. Fortunately for Chinese soldiers, they seem to be going back on that doctrine and actually giving some gear to its soldiers.

Strategy

At the moment, China does appear to be adopting a defensive strategy unlike what a lot of western leaders say. Fortifications on islands and establishment of a new defensive perimeter, while aggressive moves, are still largely for defensive benefit. Perhaps after this first phase is completed, China will work on first-strike capabilities and expanding its sphere of influence further. China rarely gets involved in war. Last time they did they got kicked out by the Vietnamese after the US had already been fighting them for years.

History and Future

China's military was absolute shit 20 years ago, one of the laughingstocks of the world. They have been shit at defending borders for a long time, one of the reasons the Japanese and Europeans and Mongols before steamrolled them so quickly. Now that China is organized and is adopting modern strategies, tactics and technology, it will be interesting to see what happens. The PRC is growing up very quickly and might actually have the power to represent their large population. Education rates are rising, they have a middle class for the first time ever, and wages and quality of life are increasing. The government is cutting back further on its Communist doctrine and moving towards more sensible government. Assuming China doesn't collapse due to internal and economic factors, the next few decades could be very interesting.

tl;dr: chinks can actually take the japs in a war now

Fun challenge: count how many times the word "China" or "Chinese" is used in this post!

Edit: New and improved version with less "China"

Edit 2: ITT saltEvery time someone tells HKers they are racist they attempt to defend it or to say "there's a reason for our racism".

I've lived in HK and I know the situation there. I don't even care about stereotyping or racism that much, but I despise HK hypocrisy that they are better than mainlanders when they are really not that much better. Personal attacks on anyone who disagrees are everywhere in HK social media circles, whereas similar attacks are universally derided in the West.Just speak English in HK, and if they don't understand you, pretend using a broken Canto accent ;)I lived in HK for a long time, and I am pretty certain HK is more racist than the West.

The things I can find on Facebook in HK circles and things I hear from friends are nowhere near what I've seen or experienced in America.

Things like:

- Mainlanders are locusts

- LOL Filipinos are all hobos on Sundays

- Why do Indians always smell like curry and never wash themselves?

- We need another Japanese invasion to kill all the mainlanders

- Shouting "Bat lau dung laai" repeatedly after knowing someone came from Vietnam

I'd imagine these statements are universally derided in the West outside of certain special groups.

I know this sounds harsh but I would never want to go back to HK again unless I live in an expat/Westerner bubble and refuse to interact with locals. I also wish I never learnt Cantonese.

I'm sorry if you are offended but I'm very sick of HK racism and the attempt to justify such racism.

---

You know, some HKers also say they are more civilized than mainlanders, and while that is True based on minutiae details like lining up or not peeing on the floor, HKers aren't really far from mainlanders given the things they say when no one's looking. I'd imagine they wouldn't say these things to an expat or a Westerner./u/komnenos is one of the milder posters in /r/China. I've never seen him writing anything that is anywhere close to racist speech.

I can confirm that because I'm one of the shitposters there ;)

Left /r/china because there are no interesting discussions there anymore - too monotonic. And I can't be half-assed to post stuff there anymore.No Ulm in Siberia 0/10/r/clashofclansrecruitI've never met such people, and I consider myself lucky for that.

Just today I was talking to a transfer student from Tsinghua about the Sino-Indian conflict (I honestly don't think it constitutes as a "war"), and the treatment of Tibet and there were scarcely any unpleasantness.

Then again I do go out of my way to avoid sensitive topics with people I do not know well because I used to make people upset and feel "threatened" sigh.Well, the people I talk to are from the top ends. I know two transfer undergrads from Tsinghua, one from Peking U, two grads from Tsinghua, and one postgrad from Fudan. I also have a family member with a PhD from Tsinghua.

All of them say that American style education is better.

I may be an undergrad only, but I do talk to people from academia because of my family background. There is a bias though - the grads, postgrads and professors I know are all primarily STEM and economics. And I don't talk to professors much because they're old, so it's usually them telling me their life stories, which I do readily absorb.

Either way, don't take what I say seriously. I will almost definitely change my mind one year later.

What's interesting is that whenever I say this people get upset but when they say the same thing everyone nods in agreement.Next time don't get yourself in that kind of trouble. The concept of owing and doing favors for someone is complete hogwash and needs to be cleansed.I mean we've probably seen multiple incarnations of the post but I don't think we should ban them yet.This is so adorable :)If you view extra and intro -version as a spectrum, it is possible for one to fall somewhere near the middle - an ambiverted individual. Someone who want to talk with other people while also wanting some alone time.Tsinghua has a wonderful engineering facility, immense funding from the government, and top tier professors (within China) including, from what I know from a friend, a Turing Award winner teaching in the faculty, etc....

It is not a bad school. But it is definitely nowhere near the top schools in America IMO. The speculation that Chinese academics participate in group citations for the purpose of increasing rankings needs a citation. From what I understand, people in Tsinghua are obsessed with publications, and hence spam a huge ton of papers with somewhat poor quality. Since the amount of researchers in a specific field is often low, therefore they cite people within the circles for publications, because they can't be bothered to find better sources, do original research etc., and not because they actually want to cite them. This means indirectly climbing the ranking system because the US News methodology puts a rather heavy weight on publications and citations.

Anyways, most people wouldn't dream of saying that Tsinghua is at the same level as MIT, for instance. At least the Tsinghua graduates and transfers I know don't think that.&gt; it's just memorization and cramming

Yep. Every single Chinese grad/postgrad/whatever I've met said they really hated this system. It shuts down a person's creative capacity and it's so sad that an entire nation's people are going through this system.To make it less confusing, please use the terms "storage" and "drill" instead because most people use collectors to mean the elixir pumps and gold mines.Does Tina have social anxiety or something?He's building a wall along the Atlantic.so much dramaThis is so sweet :) (\u25e1\u203f\u25e1\u273f) This can be exploited somehow...From what I've heard you're going to masters to get the loot win bonus.Congrats! Now push to 5000 :)OMG! I feel so bad for the Chinese nationals at my university. There was this transfer student who is really shy and it's really nice talking to him all the time. But yet it takes a single asshole making fun of him (*) to make him feel uncomfortable in America :(

(*) A guy knew he's from China and since he can't speak English that well, he proceeded to mock him asking incredibly mundane questions like talking to a child: "Did you go to class today? Good good." "Your English is really good!"

Well, perhaps it isn't easy to see how that's really mean when written in text.

Also, the Chinese students always talk among themselves. I can only join if I myself told them I lived in HK and can speak Chinese.http://puu.sh/l5cRc.jpg

Here's my suggestion.

1. Deploy left cutter drag to wear down BK.

2. Deploy cutter 1.

3. Deploy cutter 2.

4. When CC is lured, deploy BK.

5. Deploy rest of dragons.

6. Deploy balloons.

7. Rage on location shown.

8. Heal on location shown.

9. Wait and rage.

Key points:

- Your BK and left drags should take out at least the mortar to minimize balloons from straying far from the core.

- Balloons have a low speed so deploying them early is fine because there are very little high HP structures in front of the ADs, meaning dragons will get targeted by the ADs early.

- Heal to maintain balloons HP. They will help you get rid of the rest of the defenses.Arabic and Hebrew (I think in this case it's Hebrew) is always written from right to left.This reminds me of the camping on transport roof trick before one day it was patched.http://puu.sh/l5fqx.jpg

1. Deploy giant en route to archer tower to lure the CC out.

2. Place one archer on the builder hut.

3. Kill the CC like how you do it in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbwFnCX0ZfM

4. Clear the gold mines and elixir collectors near the archer tower with archers (while not in range of the archer tower)

5. Deploy dragon

6. Once dragon is targeted by the AD, deploy balloons en route to AD IMMEDIATELY.

7. Deploy the rest of the balloons. &gt; Yet somehow if a Chinese international student whose English is dogshit somehow conned their way into a U.S. university with falsified test scores, essays and letters of recommendation, we are supposed to view them as victims of American arrogance when they get called out on their bullshit?

Take your bad day mood elsewhere. I'm not interested in replying to the same old stereotypes over and over again.

Furthermore you're underestimating the ability of admissions to detect BS from a mile away.Yep.You clearly aren't in touch with the processes of today's admissions. Generic essays produced from the firms are slashed like grass.

Furthermore I doubt you actually know any Chinese international students. The majority I've met are smart and hardworking individuals with less-than-perfect spoken English. That doesn't mean they can't write in English.

If you've actually know people who work in admissions (I do), actually know Chinese international students (I do), assessed a Chinese international student's ability through communication (I did), then come back and repeat the same claim.

Not to mention the communication channels between universities to warn each other of fraud cases and background checks on individuals. There are even rumors of colleges planting spies in hired college essay sites.I'm aware of the brokers who coach students getting into top colleges. In fact, it isn't at all uncommon for students to be hiring them.

It is unfair, because a high income family can more readily get a consultant for admissions. I recall someone I know who had consulting with [this firm](http://theedge.com.hk/admissions-consulting/), which costed 100k HKD. Very expensive.

BUT, these firms do not tell you any *essential information* a normal individual could not know themselves. They grant you an edge, through

- Getting distilled and relevant information vs. sifting through tons of garbage information and speculation on the Internet

- Having connections with admissions alumni from top universities (NO you don't get a free ticket, they don't name drop. Communication with current admissions is forbidden; you only get connections with past admissions). You can still get the same information by reading books and forum posts etc. written by admissions people, or asking the current admissions questions.

- Giving you an idea of the culture of a university, which IMO, is the sharpest edge you can get.

HOWEVER, these brokers, in the interest of protecting their legitimacy, do NOT deal secretly with universities to let people in, or help someone who is going to lie. The number one thing they tell you is to be yourself and be honest. The way to game the (at least US) college admissions system is to be honest and unique, while being consistent during the interview and with test scores, GPA, and ECs. There is no possible way to achieve that by having someone write your essay for you. If you do that you'll be rejected because admissions have worked many years in the industry to be able to detect essay mill products from a mile away.

What these people do is to essentially babysit rich kids by giving them deadlines ("Hey, Jake, give me your second draft for Yale by Friday, okay, and let's go through it together for one hour on Saturday"), telling them things they can all find on the Internet ("The average SAT score of MIT is 2250..."), etc. and occasionally giving them "insider" info which is pretty easy to find like ("UChicago has a gen ed. program that covers philosophy and you can use that in your essay")

Anyone can game the system easily. Collegeconfidential gives many tips on that. Admissions consultants just have years of experience and bring you the distilled and no-BS version. By gaming the system I don't mean getting into schools beyond your capability. What I mean is to get into a school you deserve to get into with a higher-than-average chance.The admissions at my university had little such concern. There is a tendency to avoid Chinese applicants because they do try to commit fraud, but they can easily distinguish between the Chinese committing fraud and those who are honest and unique. Consequently most Chinese international students are actually deserving of the spot they have taken.I know an admissions officer and we have discussed this issue before.I don't *deny* that Chinese students fraud.

What I am *denying* is that admissions lack the capability to detect such fraud. Admissions KNOW that there is such fraud, they preemptively prevent such fraud, be more careful when they read essays from someone from China, reject generic Chinese essays, etc. The admissions officer I know had years of experience in the field. Sure there are always one or two who slips past, but the majority of the Chinese applicants my university accepts are actually deserving of the spot, because the admissions have done a fine job of rejecting fraud cases. Consequently Chinese international students are not people who don't deserve to be in this university which you so want to claim.

There are many alarm bells that come with fraud cases. Inconsistency, for one. Generic essays, for another. I think you don't have enough faith in admissions to detect fraud.

A sure way to test whether a massive volume of fraud cases slip past is to look at the GPA statistics. Chinese nationals have around the same average GPA with us.First of all, if you want to be better at war, I would recommend:

- Unlocking dark spell factory and leveling it up to 2

- Upgrading zap to 5

- Upgrading hogs to 4

You can't do much with this base other than a dragloon (9/9) from 2:00.

http://puu.sh/l5j2J.jpg

1. Triple zap AD.

1. Deploy cutter dragons first, wait for them until they get in range of the air defenses.

2. Deploy the rest of the dragons.

3. Once orange X defenses are down deploy balloons as shown.If you miss three arrows, that wouldn't be the case, which is perfectly possible. The delay can potentially take a longer time than the span of two arrows. Assuming an archer fires one shot per second, then missing 1.1 seconds in the beginning is equivalent to missing 3 shots: 1 shot at 180s left, 1 at 179s left, 1 at the last.

However, given that the TH has a significant amount of HP left, I do believe that 22 DPS is an incorrect figure. But with the correct stats, it is still technically possible to achieve the result of a TH8 not dying.&gt; Lovaas and others noted that, as widespread as cheating may be, most Chinese students who are accepted to U.S. institutions apply honestly, and tend to do well, which Deupree said points to another reason for increasing vigilance against fraud: \u201cNot just because it\u2019s a bad thing, but because institutions don\u2019t want students to fail.\u201d [source](http://hechingerreport.org/concerns-rise-cheating-chinese-applicants-u-s-colleges/)

I really don't think it's just my university, although I do not have solid data to back that up for other universities. In my university I know the international students do tend to do well. And from what I've seen from articles, other universities also note that Chinese students do well. And it is far harder to commit fraud within a university because it's extremely difficult to find someone to write an academic level essay for you.

This suggests that the amount of fraudulent applicants managing to slip past admissions is lower than what would be the case if we see Chinese students consistently underperforming compared to their peers.

By generic essays I don't mean boring essays that make everyone yawn. I mean essays that are generic and either seem to be "too perfect", doesn't fit one's ECs and transcript, or not sounding like a teenager.

There are many ways for admissions to detect fraud and I really hope people put more faith in them. They are good at what they do seriously.

The College Board is being vigilant by removing China as one of their testing locations, last I checked. (Bravo for their brave decision!) There are many checks in place in admissions, and people are very aware of Chinese fraud. It's not at all easy for them to slip through.&gt; The point is, if they didn't cheat, they wouldn't have a chance.

Are you for real?

Tons of international applicants around the world with less than perfect spoken English get in. They have an accent and they don't understand slang that well, but that doesn't mean they can't write an essay. Wtf?

That Chinese international students get a comparable average GPA with Americans is indication enough that the majority of them didn't cheat their way in and are qualified. Unless you think you can just cheat through university.

There is also the fact that a lot of universities accept Chinese who attended international schools or have lived overseas for a while. The ones that truly lived as a local in China are rare. They are not inept.

Either way, I'm willing to accept that perhaps my university is an exception rather than the norm. As I've said I don't have solid data to back up claims for other universities, but I do know that very little fraud gets through at mine. I've read some posts from admission officers in other universities and they do have mechanisms to prevent fraud, but I do not know their GPA stats to know whether they are working.I have NEVER said admissions fraud does not exist.

I'm saying admissions is capable of preventing fraud from getting through. They have so many years of experience that they are simply capable of detecting BS within 2 minutes of reading an applicant's profile. They are automatically more vigilant when reading a profile from a Chinese applicant, and any slight indicator of fraud automatically gets rejected. I really don't think Chinese applicants can get away with fraud.Um... r/am and its variants sometimes claim that too.

So I guess CCP indoctrination spreads wide.

Either way I'm making this post really because I dislike r/am making bullshit claims like this.Tumblrinas are child murderers confirmed.I don't even feel comfortable saying that I have Impostor Syndrome...I seriously doubt that.

Anyways, too busy today to be arguing this, but I do concede you have a point. If I have the time I will talk to the officer I know since he's in my house anyways.

I still think it is almost impossible for one to maintain a decent GPA through cheating. There are presentations to do, essays required at a highly rigorous level in highly specific fields, finals (you can't cheat proofs or a program) and midterms, etc.

I know highly talented Chinese nationals with crappy spoken English but decent essay writing skills. I simply cannot accept the claim that most Chinese international students are cheaters unless I see convincing proofs: 

- Average Chinese international student GPA is lower

- A sample essay from an essay mill

- Independent proof that they manage to send an underqualified applicant to a university consistently at a 80% success rate

I have not insinuated that the average Chinese applicant can write an essay as well as Americans. I have said that some of them are capable of doing that. Those who are in the top 1%, who went out of their way to read classics and study English rigorously, rewrite their essays a thousand times with non-fraud help from consultants.Anon is blackThis is so fucking autisticWhy would they do that when they are family and friends who have also went to the US?You are right that's a better plan.This one is much harder and I can't offer you a 3-star advice sorry.What?? If I'm not wrong this is making Impossible sound much easier than before? Is that correct? Or are there things I'm missing.Um this is a troll guys don't fall for it.The Jewish lobby is particularly strong in the US. Mearsheimere wrote a rather controversial book on it.So fucking fakeCommunism!Now do a second campaign!Are narrow spectrum drugs better?This. The AI in this game follows very consistent patterns. It is up to the user to learn the mechanics well and learn how to deal with issues like that.This is so far from the truth. I know biologists (one guy researching genetic diseases) who believe in microevolution and intelligent design, for one. They are rare, but not "0 out of 10". 10 out of 10 is a vast hyperbole.

Why is reddit supporting vastly inaccurate claims like this? Boggles my mind. Scientists are as fallible as engineers.Yeah I was used to the early b15 early game.More interesting than your monotone. Go back to SyriaIs it that hard to Google itDestroyers replaced by raiders? Definitely do not remember that and that's an awesome change!Post some insightful or informative discussions then. It bores the hell out of people but well, it's the Internet, not a forum with professors chiming on all issues.You should perhaps use clearer language then, because "What the fuck is microevolution" does not convey whatever you're trying to say well.

Microevolution makes perfect sense unless you're trying to deny the existence of it. It's like a high school concept and I doubt you really don't know what it means. So are you trying to say believing in microevolution and intelligent design simultaneously does not make sense? Then argue with the scientist, not me. I pointed out that such people exist, but you somehow think that all scientists have the exact same beliefs, which is frankly ridiculous. Physicists have misconceptions of biology, and biologists physics. Most scientists study in a narrow field and it is quite possible they have many misconceptions on fields they are not versed in.I disagree that Japan is a creative society.&gt; The concept of "microevolution" as distinct from "macroevolution" makes no sense. One implies the other. It's Zeno shit, it's like saying I can take individual steps but those steps wont' add up to a mile.

Are you a biologist? Do you have a specialization in evolutionary science? If not, perhaps you shouldn't make claims like that.

The best I can offer is that there are debates within the field. One guy I knew who did research on bacterial resistance (closely related with microevolution) told me there isn't conclusive evidence that microevolution leads to macroevolution. Consider the argument that macroevolution is a significant change in allele frequencies but microevolution occurs not necessarily with change in allele frequencies, rather also through other means such as balancing selection. Microevolution does not necessarily lead to macroevolution.

I think people without a specialization in a particular field should not try to tell others what to believe. Evolution is not conclusively proven, and hence more research needs to be done on it to investigate rather than pretending that all is well. I am so thankful academia is above society zeitgeist.

Anyways, this is not to say people don't believe in evolution. This is to say that people don't think the current explanations of evolution is satisfactory. Society should hold its breath and wait for the field to mature before concluding anything.Converting enemy defenses sound fun.

Give him low HP (~60) and a 5 second count to be able to convert enemy defenses only, with a very high troop space (30).Um...not sure what this is about.I think it should count as destroyed.I would recommend wall breakers to 4.Yes I know that.&gt; animated TV ... comics

What a weeaboo.Cheating through 4 years is extremely hard in university.

There can be rich kids who cheat in university but they need a significant amount of effort and money to cheat through university.

The probability that all Chinese international students cheat through university successfully is low because most of them can't afford to cheat like this. (Consider finals, midterms, discussion)

Chinese international students have a comparable GPA to Americans

Therefore it is likely that the probability of underqualified students getting in is very low.

The Chinese students here are capable and hardworking. It is unlikely they were underqualified and had to rely on fraud to get in.

Besides, I said

&gt; Sure there are always one or two who slips past

It is far harder to prove that Chinese international students are all fraud cases when they have high GPA, participate well in class (although they do have an accent and speak slower), etc.; the evidence is overwhelmingly to the contrary.

I have not seen a single case of a Chinese fraud case managing through university from any of you here, it isn't a huge concern of admissions, and all of you are just repeating things you've found on the Internet. Based on what I'm seeing in my university and statistics obtained I'm convinced that the probability of Chinese fraud cases getting through is very low.

By the way, if you want to point out other people's logical fallacies, I'd advice you to not do that unless you have clearly dissected an argument. There exists data that backs up the generalization. It is not generalization from limited observations.I'm suggesting a new troop. This argument is incredibly silly. Everyone clearly knows what I mean.The day when people stop asking about cheaters.I have found that sneaking to the left and rushing up to take the high ground seems to be the best way to deal with this LZ. On a swarming mission this LZ can be hell and taking the left route seems to trigger the least pods at one time. You're cutting it really close though: at least one turn needs to be spent on rushing up the hill with little cover in the middle, forcing you to dash. If there is a pod on the higher ground at the left of the bus you'd be royally screwed.Spend $4000 to max Th10 with gems.Um...askhistorians and askscience are discussion based but pretty good actually.YepReasonable price - $68

Wtf&gt; Morals and ethics are essentially the same thing.



Um this is so very wrong.

Very unrigorously speaking, morals is the personal conduct of an individual and ethics the philosophy of an individual as to what is right and wrong.

There is a sharp distinction between these two terms in philosophy.No they are absolutely NOT interchangeable unless you want to fail your philosophy essay.Because they may want to attack a th8...???&gt; all of the students who were upset were the feminists, the activists, and there\u00a0they were, treating a woman of color professor like she wasn\u2019t an authority while treating old white dudes like they are.

Nailed it.So fucking autisticWhat? Have you even taken a philosophy course before? Not everyone's shower thoughts is philosophy.Your language is like what a typical weeaboo would use. Thankfully without the desu and bakaIf you seriously think anime and that crap is indicative of Japanese creativity then I can not take you seriously.

Think Hideki and those people for real Japanese intelligence and creativity.Agreed. I'm tired of opening these links to see nothing.Do I seriously have to see the same boring "MODDING!" post like three or four times every dayRule 8 - No pictures of chat as posts2 heal 1 rage is better.Um, I watched anime pretty extensively during high school so I know what I'm judging. No, I don't think it's creative.

You really sound like a weeaboo right now defending anime so madly.Who the fuck talked about BL fictionChinese girls fucking love BL. They are heterosexual girls too. I have absolutely no idea why. Chinese guys also love GL. Keep spamming some "yuri" crap (that's les hentai for you wieners).

I'm not a psychology major unlike someone else here so I have no rational way of explaining this.Yes I am aware.Haha typical weeabooBL = boy's love

GL = girl's love

basically gay / lesbian hentai. It's fucking everywhere in China I wouldn't be surprised if I see it on a bus the next time I visit.Meanwhile Trump is building a Great Wall to stop MexicansSuppression only reduces aim by 30. This is not a lot when you consider that aliens can potentially have 100 aim. Alien AI like to hit the suppressor, which means suppressor should try to defense / HP stack as much as possible and stay in full cover. I personally don't rely on suppression to stop an alien from hitting someone, but use suppression in a way such that the aliens divert targets on a beefier target (usually the gunner) with an aim penalty.In the case that the Outsiders don't come up, you have to take the initiative to go down or to lure them up.

To do this you'll need to make sure some of the doors of the room below are not opened. You could lure them in such a way so that they all go onto one side (do this on the roof, don't go down), then spread your troops so that some of them go in and one of them stays outside. For some reason sometimes the AI does not open the door when moving in and out of them, so in this way the alien on the outside will be trapped. Send your team down, 3 to block the big door, and 1 the small door and surround the lone outsider for an easy kill, then go back up immediately, while holding the small door beside the ladder. Tracking the outsiders can easily be achieved through tile scanning. Watch out for overwatch.

Alternatively you can position yourself vulnerably so that the Outsiders can jump up to flank you while not being flanked. This is a more dangerous strategy but so far I've found that they usually use their yellow move to flank you most of the time.

Even if the outsider pod spawns in the large room, this is still achievable by simply triggering the pod and then dashing all the way onto the roof.

The major downside to this strategy is that there is an LR outsider in early March which can ruin everything; I've seen Outsiders being aggressive and take shots while being flanked. (I don't know when LR outsiders spawn on different difficulties though, so you may not see one).

Result:

http://puu.sh/l7y54.jpgI hate midgame landed research scouts the most; personally I think they are one of the toughest missions there is. Landed transports are less tougher, but I enjoy them because I know I'm going to get lots of resources. In the early game it is better to try to stay outside the ship or go onto the roofs to clear pods. In the mid and late game I just try to roof snipe instead. Either way transport missions is all about triggering as little pods as possible IMO.OF COURSE the civvies run towards the chryssalid after being saved.I would kick that soldier with such horrible stats, or put him in a later-to-be-MEC section.

I personally only value will on Assaults, so that means they must have high HP, high mobility and high will. I usually hire lots of soldiers and kick half of them. My medic psions usually play a supportive psi role so I really don't care that much about will on medics.

If you must, then a psi-medic is a decent choice.I would've done the non-cheese, shredder + explosive + flashbang way were it not for the fact that I only had 4 SPECs ready (2 infantries, 1 sniper, 1 gunner) at the time.

I haven't been on this sub for a long time so I don't know what's been going on.

I don't know the LW difficulties mechanics that well, so I can't comment on that. As far as I'm aware, AR affects leader level chance, but it's been a long time since I looked at AR mechanics. (I do remember installing a mod to check it though).

Edit: found it

&gt; Note that these scaling factors don't affect everything that research affects.
&gt; These only effect the rate at which alien stat upgrades appear, and the capping effect of when alien leaders can appear.
&gt; The do not effect when aliens can appear, when they upgrade pod size, nor anything to do with the interception game.

I haven't been playing since 15c, so I don't know what has changed.

I also don't know what "capping effect of when alien leaders can appear" means. Does it mean when *any* alien leader of a given species can appear in the game, or when *a certain level* of alien leader of a given species can appear?

Either way I think all difficulties should ~~see an~~ be able to potentially see an LR outsider on a landed transport in early March since there does not seem to be any differences in starting AR across difficulties AFAIK.I mean they've already done that before getting angry and leave.

I imagine that Xi's tech visit is having quite some effect on Google's decisions.They self-censored already while in China. IIRC China wanted them to censor even harder and it broke the camel's back. I do not know the details.&gt; There's so many different things you can now do in character customization that you couldn't do with Enemy Unknown, and that's all because we wanted you to get more attached to the soldiers that you will eventually lose

Sadist. PURE sadist right here.I've always treated XCom as a strategy game...I really couldn't care less about XCom2's plot as long as it is decent.

If I want good plot I'd play other games.

&gt; Negative, negative, negative. 
&gt; But I'd rather be negative and correct than constantly getting let down by AAA shittiness. Being positive doesn't make bad games better. Just means you have no pattern recognition.

lol

&gt; Here, it feels like Firaxis is leaning on the meta-data of "99% of players couldn't beat I/I, so that must mean hardly anyone finished the game" to justify the current events.

Whoa, when did this happen? I must have been living in a cave! Did not know this at all.[Texture Mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/504)

[SweetFX settings](http://pastebin.com/7vCD5q6b)I can see how camping on the roof is an uncomfortable strategy, especially since the cover on top is not very good, and any alien can easily flank soldiers on the roof by jumping up. For me, that the LOS on enemies below is horrible is precisely why I camp on the roof. It limits alien's sight on me from below, forcing them to jump up (usually one by one) and hopefully die to overwatch. There is no good cover for them either, meaning they are forcibly flanked, too, which reduces (not eliminate!) the chance for them to fire on you. In many cases, because they don't have sight on you, they dash onto the roof, meaning even if they don't die to overwatch, they will not have an action left. It is a dangerous strategy, but I feel that it is a strategy that disrupts the AI because the AI can *sense* where you are and coordinate their movements based on where you are, but they seem to take cover based on what they see instead.

Either way, I think the breach method is the better method when you have sufficient soldiers to do so. I only really do the roof camping method when I'm forced to, such as in very early March with limited options, or when I have a limping squad.Thanks for the info. Yeah, I didn't know this at all, but now that I do, I agree that this is probably the straw rather than the push from CCP.

Perhaps this is also why Google is returning? Xi agreed to "eliminate" China's hacking activities, so perhaps Google feels confident to return.Since when did S&amp;M become an MSGT perk? Last I played it wasn't. Was it a post-b15d change?

I did use Smoke &amp; Mirrors on scouts before this change? Haven't looked into the new changes that much and I think I'm going to have to reconsider. [Why I chosen S&amp;M before](https://np.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/2zd5c4/lwb15b_lets_build_a_scout/):

&gt; Anyways:
&gt; 
&gt; I just want to note an interesting use of scouts.
&gt; 
&gt; Some soldier can acid a cover-based organic near the squad, such as a Muton. The scout can Flush and Holo-target the unit, which causes it to move most of the time. This movement usually causes the unit to flank itself because of AI seemingly confused by acid ^(^get ^it? ^get ^it? ^ahahhah) (works with flashbang as well but not as funny). The rest of the squad can kill it easily with the applied holo-targeting.

&gt; 
&gt; - Run mechanicals' overwatch (**LR**), and chem it (**S&amp;M**), get close enough for acid grenade range safely in cover (**Sprinter**), since mechanicals often stay at the edge of LOS upon bad activations.
&gt; 
&gt; - Holo-target HFloater leaders (**Holo-targeting**), more likely to hit (**Deadeye**); kill stray-HP fliers (**Deadeye** + **Flush**), hunt stray fliers since Floaters love to run away (**Sprinter** + **Deadeye** + **Flush**)
&gt; 
&gt; - Flank and crit organics on start of turn (**Sprinter** + **Concealment**) (*highly not recommended unless you are very good at positioning to lure the enemy in a correct direction, otherwise it will only make the activation significantly harder*)

S&amp;M scouts were absolutely fantastic on terror missions when dealing with Mechtoids and Sectopods last I played. I don't know whether it still works as well right now.

---

I never use shotguns on Engineers, so I don't think HEAT Ammo is useless on Engineers just because you have a different playstyle. That said, the way I use engineers, I still wouldn't take HEAT Ammo.I can't agree that S&amp;M only has synergy with concealment. It has synergy with Sprinter and LR too.OP is making fun of someone else (not me for a change) with the thread title. He's not actually trying to ask anything.Full base: http://puu.sh/l7JnH.png

My troops: http://puu.sh/l7Jo3.pngYour interceptors have a chance to completely annihilate a UFO rendering no crashed UFO mission.The first terror mission is always the harshest. Good luck.

I actually don't suggest you rely on explosives. Floaters are the real threat in March/April terror missions IMHO, so cautious engagement is better. An AP grenade can make short work of a Chryssalid pod combined with everyone else firing even on Impossible. Your real goal is to deal with the Floaters. That means aim stacking (holo-targeting), early Deadeye troops, suppression, shredder rockets. Absolutely do not waste a rocket on Chryssalids in March/April.

I honestly think Chryssalids are mostly trivial early on (even the L9 Chryssalid is trivial if you know how to deal with it). Floaters are far tougher.

That said, very quickly you'll learn that Chryssalids, while being fairly easy to deal with, are extremely annoying due to their occasional tendency to run away from you and kill civvies, similar to Floaters, but with them spawning a legion of zombies.I would go with Flak. There are so many ways to deal with mechanics but there aren't as many with HFloaters.You only get 2~3 rockets per rocketeer early on (depending on perks and loadout). These are far more worth spent on eliminating floaters.

The reason why I wouldn't waste a rocket on Chryssalids is because they clump together quite often (there are cases where they don't and split off to hunt civvies though), meaning an AP grenade + another AP grenade or shots from everyone would eliminate the Chryssalid pod. Whereas floaters fly and can't be grenaded easily, but could be rocketed.

I would bring:

Assault - Infantry - Engineer - Rocketeer x2 - Scout for an early terror mission.By limited I mean limited per mission.[Texture Mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/504/?tab=2&amp;amp;navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fxcom%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D504&amp;amp;pUp=1)

[SweetFX settings](http://pastebin.com/7vCD5q6b)Well, sad to say but I like to find exploits in the game. It's just my playstyle. I like thinking about how the AI interacts with the surroundings and what I do and figure out a best way to deal with it. It does not make me feel smarter...it's just .... how I like to play the game - using rather weird and unintuitive methods (and not necessarily any more optimal than how others do it most of the time). Yeah I agree, I don't think the game should be balanced around people like me, because I'm clearly in the minority (I think).I don't feel safe in any aircraft. Men keep looking at me and it's highly triggering. Maybe you should check your privilege for even feeling safe in an aircraft.6 Outsiders, yes.&gt; A Gem mine

The airgame is fine as it is IMHO. The only struggle I've encountered was the midgame destroyer HUGE boost and the frantic rush for lategame airgame tech/manufacturing.&gt; What your Gunner typically does in almost every important tactical situation for almost the entire game is suppress something from heavy cover every turn

I have to disagree with this quite strongly. Suppression is much weaker than chem+flashbang and it's quickly outphased in the midgame for me. I only suppress on trivial pods, or when I'm in a prolonged firefight.

With the right build gunners can be a decent midgame HEAT choice capable of helping the assault destroy two Mechtoids.This is the epitome of Facebook pics... I think I have seen everything there is to seeUM OP please this is a joke don't take it seriously.It used to be better than Reddit. Fight me.

You can embed many things in a post, the UI is much clearer, and a sub can contain many things beyond posts and links. Furthermore the discussions there are frequently as deep as what you'll find on Reddit. The small subs can contain high level content, except for the more academic subs.

Reddit has a clunky and horrible UI. Were it not for the fact I'm so used to it I wouldn't even come here.

The airgame when done well can be a huge hitter on the aliens which makes the tactical game easier.LOL nothing to see here anymore mods banned that wiener

Anyways, here it is:

---

Soon China might have quality on their side as well. Many experts and analysts seem to think that if Chinese military spending and production continues, they will be roughly equal to the US in 15-20 years or will at least have closed the gap by a substantial margin.

Technology

China is working on a fleet of supercarriers (Around 4-6 carriers as well as escort/heli carriers) which will allow them to extend their range of operations as well as possibly use the same gunboat diplomacy the US uses. Due to current supply ship constraints, the supercarriers will likely have to work in "hunting packs" of two carriers.

Then there's the new defensive perimeters and early-warning systems they are establishing in the pacific. China is beginning to build up its navy and air force to modern specifications. China has been opting for internal development of jets, rather than purchasing them from Russia, US or other arms manufacturers. There appears to have been espionage conducted as many aspects of their new line of stealth fighters greatly resemble next-gen Russian jets.

China's space program is developing into a very powerful entity that is not useful only for civilian aspects but for military as well. China has the resources to deploy an intelligence network that would rival the US and other large networks. China is also working on so-called "carrier-killers" and anti-ship missiles as well as anti-satellite missiles which could present a large problem as we already have enough debris in orbit to worry about.

Disadvantages in supplies and equipment

One of China's disadvantages is that they give their soldiers so little gear. Average cost to outfit a Chinese soldier is around $2,000, compared to US/Russia and just about any other Western country that spends more around $20,000. This means that radios, compasses, and body armor are scarce. Only elite units or units that are expecting combat or on parade get to wear the fancy gear.

China believes that spending more on equipment will make soldiers feel safer and less likely to fight as hard which I think is a stupid strategy that will get people killed. Fortunately for Chinese soldiers, they seem to be going back on that doctrine and actually giving some gear to its soldiers.

Strategy

At the moment, China does appear to be adopting a defensive strategy unlike what a lot of western leaders say. Fortifications on islands and establishment of a new defensive perimeter, while aggressive moves, are still largely for defensive benefit. Perhaps after this first phase is completed, China will work on first-strike capabilities and expanding its sphere of influence further. China rarely gets involved in war. Last time they did they got kicked out by the Vietnamese after the US had already been fighting them for years.

History and Future

China's military was absolute shit 20 years ago, one of the laughingstocks of the world. They have been shit at defending borders for a long time, one of the reasons the Japanese and Europeans and Mongols before steamrolled them so quickly. Now that China is organized and is adopting modern strategies, tactics and technology, it will be interesting to see what happens. The PRC is growing up very quickly and might actually have the power to represent their large population. Education rates are rising, they have a middle class for the first time ever, and wages and quality of life are increasing. The government is cutting back further on its Communist doctrine and moving towards more sensible government. Assuming China doesn't collapse due to internal and economic factors, the next few decades could be very interesting.

tl;dr: chinks can actually take the japs in a war now

Fun challenge: count how many times the word "China" or "Chinese" is used in this post!

Edit: New and improved version with less "China"

Edit 2: ITT saltThat shows more the maturity of people there than Tieba itself. I'm aware of everything you've said, but I don't think the major subs at Tieba are indicative of what Tieba is, just like how you can't use /r/funny (God curse that sub) to judge Reddit.

Besides, Reddit drama is not that much better anyways.Yep you will auto-collect the meld.

Figuring out roughly how many pods a given mission will have helps with determining whether you should prioritize killing a pod or sneak to the meld.I agree but I just keep coming back just to see that one guy who keeps spamming the same thing. You should do the same it's pretty funny.\&gt; Bing

Crashed scouts/raiders are a nice change of scenery.[Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIQpURumcO0)[Misc] for miscellaneousYou realize if you throw more lightning reflexes on the enemies it's only going to make the game harder for people who don't use these strategies? It's unfair to the people who don't cheese this way.

Yes, Impossible should be hard, but it should be balanced around normal people playing the normal way, not people who go around finding exploits like this. It should be balanced around the majority.I use suppression for target control too, but most of the time I don't want to. By the late game I usually have tanks taking on the job of target control.I remember they designed the map based on an actual location in ... Europe? Where is this?If the aliens are flanking you they get a 50% crit chance boost and that is not changeable in DGC.ini unless you want to remove your own flanking bonus too.

You can reduce the aliens crit bonuses otherwise in Balancemods_Normal:

    BalanceMods_Normal=(eType=eChar_ExaltSniper,		iDamage=0, iCritHit=330, 	iAim=404,iDefense=0,iHP=0, 	iMobility=0,	iWill=0)

    where xx = aim yy = crit chance in iAim = xxyy. 

So just remove the yy part of iAim.

You *could* try to give the aliens -50 crit chance to remove their flanking bonus in BalanceMods_Normal. But I'm not sure how to do this without knowing how the mod reads iAim.

If it directly parses iAim into String and splits them, then possibly something like "iAim = 04-50" could work.

If it operates on the integer directly, you can possibly do something like "iAim = -050".

This is assuming there are no validation checks.

Also, you can remove perks granting crit chance, for example:

    BalanceMods_Hard=(eType=eChar_MutonElite,			iDamage=1, iCritHit=8, 		iAim=5, iDefense=0, iHP=10,	iMobility=32,	iWill=30); Aggression

Change iMobility to 0.DSKAfter a while you will get a sense of what TH8s you can take on, even with TH7 troops. Just keep raiding and learn from it.

I still only have TH7 troops so far (http://puu.sh/l9BJc.png). Getting drag3, zap5, hog3/4 so no time for barch5 yet.

Targets were all TH8s with mid-range defenses (Wiz4/5, Arch9, Cannon9 etc.)Drag 3 -&gt; Zap 5 to unlock zapquake. (Quake 2 is useless)

Hog 3 -&gt; Hog 4 to unlock hogs.

Heal 5 -&gt; Rage 5 to help zapquake and hogs be better.

Loons 5 -&gt; Wiz 5 to start donating good troops in a Lv5+ clan. Also helps zapquake using 813.

My path is:

Drag 3 -&gt; Zap 5 -&gt; Hog 3 -&gt; Hog 4 -&gt; Heal 5 -&gt; Rage 5 -&gt; Loons 5 -&gt; Wiz 5 -&gt; Poison 2 -&gt; Arch 5 -&gt; Giants 5 -&gt; WB 5 -&gt; Valk 2 -&gt; Golem 2 -&gt; Barb 5 -&gt; Gob 5 -&gt; Min 3 -&gt; Min 4 -&gt; TH9Make more alts I almost couldn't tell&gt; Japan is the \u00d6sterreich of the East.

Netizens find poor fashion sense more of a crime than insider trading

Netizens find poor fashion sense more of a crime than insider trading
An Internet user posted a comparison photo showing what the same jacket worn by Xu, in handcuffs left, looks like on handsome, muscular models. [Photo/Internet]

The detention of a Chinese fund manager for suspected insider trading and stock market manipulation has created an outcry among Internet users, not because of his questionable business ethics but rather his lousy sense of fashion.

With only a high school education, Xu Xiang, 37, had more than 10 billion yuan ($1.58 billion) worth of assets under his management before being arrested and his firm managed to repeatedly outperform the market with investment returns exceeding 300 percent even when the market suffered sharp declines.

With a reported personal wealth of more than four billion yuan, Xu was spotted wearing a wrinkled and ill fitting lab coat-like blazer. Added to his messy and unstylish hair, the exhausted Xu looked nothing like a trend-setting financial tycoon but rather a worn out physician when he was arrested.

A photo of him wearing handcuffs was leaked online Sunday night, which is believed to capture the moment he was detained by police.

After an initial wave of public derision targeting Xu's business ethics, Chinese Internet users shifted the focus of their ridicule toward the lab coat-like blazer, which was identified by stylists as a Giorgio Armani creation worth 26,999 yuan.

"Are you sure he was detained for market manipulation instead of illegal medical practices?" some Internet user asked mockingly.

"How come the dentist in the ambulance can manipulate stock price?" another added jokingly.

Yes. There are Chinese students studying calculus at age 12 in special schools catered towards special kids...

Chinese primary school and secondary school has a deeper math curriculum *in higher-tier cities*, but it's not so advanced as to completely overshadow Western curriculum. The level is something like 2~3 variable simultaneous equations at Grade 6, calculus at Grade 8~9, AP level calculus and some extras (induction proofs, proof of FTC, etc.) at Grade 11~12. But, no, this is not universal across China. Different schools have different speeds and depth. Furthermore, being a \u6587\u79d1 student (humanities) means that you don't need to learn these things at such a deep level, so not everyone knows these things.

---

\u62dc\u6069 is a valid translation of Brian (rare). It is less commonly used than \u5e03\u83b1\u6069 in both mainland and (possibly) HK though. (Not sure about Taiwan)

---

\u767d\u773c\u7334 is not commonly used anywhere, but anyone can understand what it means. The key part of the phrase is \u767d\u773c, and any combination with \u767d\u773c will make sense as long as it is an animal/person thing. \u767d\u773c\u72fc is the most commonly used phrase, and although I've never heard \u767d\u773c\u7334, it is very easy for Chinese to identify that, although it does sound a bit awkward.

---

Chinese is super flexible. You can invent new phrases, new ways to insult someone etc. by just combining words together. It's not a fixed language and many different ways to express an idea are equally valid, even if it may sound awkward. E.g.: \u559c\u6b22\u3001\u6b22\u559c

(No, not you combatwombat)Meredith is \u6885\u96f7\u8fea\u601d -&gt; shorten to \u6885\u96f7 and poetic alternative \u6885\u857e (lit. plum blossom bud)

\u6ca1\u4e8b\u7684\u8272 does not make sense phonetically, and it also doesn't make sense in meaning.

But yes, I agree with your point that standard translations for English names are horrendous and more often than not non-universal.I'm not going to argue with negativity in /r/china, but /r/asianmasculinity (where you go) is the sub where people propose to use concentration camps and get upvoted.

http://archive.is/m14S2

/r/am is equally bitchy and moany as /r/china. Both subs are negative and toxic. /r/am just even more so with suggestions of opening concentration camps.Um this is so wrong. There are massive regional dialect differences that can confuse a lot of people. A guy from Beijing will not understand Shanghainese or even the most common Shanghai phrases. It's part of the reason why Mandarin is established as the official language.It's only natural. Good for them too.&gt; if some families decided to have another child, the eldest child would feel threatened in the fact that this is "their family" that they have to take care of and having another child will complicate things.

Please elaborate. I don't understand this...

Then again I have siblings so I won't understand their concerns.Suburban house.Can you find posts encouraging people to open up concentration camps in /r/china?

Make no mistake, were somebody to ask me, I would immediately be able to bring up several archived posts ranging from massacre-denial to outright racism in /r/china. But can you? I suspect your accusations are more based on general impression, whereas I do have solid evidence to back up things that I claim.

But don't pretend that /r/asianmasculinity is a good sub.

It is sexist, racist, and as much an echo chamber as /r/china. I just find it more vile because at least in /r/china there are people pointing out racism occasionally. There is a variety of opinions even if the minority opinion is downvoted. In /r/asianmasculinity you get called various names from Ann Lus to Uncle Toms or whatever you have there. In /r/china, the obviously racist and massacre denial comments are downvoted. Did the crazy Genghis guy get downvoted? Scary at least 5 people agreed with him.

There are seriously problematic things ranging from deriding Asian women who don't like Asian men as self-hating, denouncing interracial relationships, thinking about Hollywood conspiracies, and just cosmic levels of butthurt and the unwillingness to listen to different opinions.

At least in /r/china I feel safe to express dissenting opinions. Oh no, not in r/am.

I strongly believe it is in the best interests of every Asian to stay away from that sub and have a positive outlook on life. LOL no I just prefer to live in a suburban house. Doesn't mean I can afford that in HK.To clarify, I meant "anyone" in the sense of any native speaker.Kind of bizarre I must say. Then again I'm not very into the filial piety thing in China, but I do see where she's coming from.Please post in English where possible. Chinese submissions should be accompanied by English translations and submitted with English titles as 99% of reddit users cannot read Chinese.:( I was just making a silly jokeLOL at the pigIf I hear one more word about Hillary emails I'm going to shoot someone. FFS no one cares who she flirts with. I'm willing to bet it's a conspiracy the media is focusing on Hillary emails to distract from her greater evils.

I think it's far more important to get the airgame/base tech done before Gauss because they go a long way in ensuring you will be consistent in the airgame and not get rekt by midgame destroyers.

Xiaomi... bleh.Australia's starting bonus does not affect this spreadsheet. When you get the soldier with Australia's bonus their stats are already rolled with the bonus. If you use Hidden Potential I'm afraid you'd have to manually input stat growth. I could implement a lowest and highest bound forecast when Hidden Potential is active, but it wouldn't be useful at all since the difference can potentially be something like 70 aim ~ 110 aim - not very useful information.

This is also why I didn't implement automatic will calculation. Will growth is random (random chance for a +1 per rank) even without Hidden Potential, and I have no way of calculating that while being exact.Don't do hogs at Lv 2.Awesome!You need *some* wizards for CC kill though :)This made my day!Up to you.

I don't care whether it's legal or not but I'm not going to smoke it personally. The argument that because God made it therefore it's safe to smoke it... God also made poisonous mushrooms, carnivorous plants, deadly fruits...

Research is unclear on the harms on marijuana but there are definitely downsides to smoking it. At the very least you may get increased risk of coughing, and at worst you may get lung cancer. It's probably better than tobacco, but that doesn't negate the risks of marijuana.

Smoke pot at your own risk. I feel that legalizing it or not is meaningless to me. Tobacco is legal and I will never smoke it because it is simply bad for your health. By the same token I would not smoke pot too.

Call me paranoid but I've even been quitting coffee for the same reason.

---

Most mainstream sources I've checked all cited that marijuana can potentially cause harm. Research in this area is limited and it is unclear what degree of harm it can cause, but I'm concerned for my health. I would also recommend close friends to stay away from pot.

Yeah I'm probably a party pooper but I hope people can stay healthy and lung cancer free 40 years later.

---

&gt; There is some evidence that occasional pot smoking can have harmful effects on the body, although the science is still too new to prove anything.

&gt; "We're learning new things every day," says Matthew J. Smith, PhD, a research assistant professor at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "Before we can really understand the effects of marijuana, further research is needed."

Better safe than sorry.FlairedNopeI very rarely eat ice cream (less than once a month), and I limit my alcohol consumption to a very high degree (haven't drank in almost half a year), and I never get drunk. Furthermore, ice cream is not inherently unhealthy when eaten in moderation, because the health risks associated with it is due to its high fat content, not because of its inherent ingredients. Nevertheless it is too easy to get addicted to eating high fat food so I stay away from it.

Are you a biologist or chemist studying the effects of marijuana on humans? Multiple sources have indicated that more research needs to be done on marijuana. There is correlation between even occasionally smoking pot and slight loss of brain functions, lung irritation, and so on. Correlation does not imply causation, but correlation suggests *there exists a possibility* for causation. 

Before definitive research is done, I am not going to consume marijuana for the sake of my health. No one knows what marijuana does to your body, and this *should* be the status quo. This should be the default stance everyone takes, unless you are the groundbreaking scientist who did a lot of research into this matter. To suggest to people it is not harmful without having conducted enough research on marijuana is irresponsible IMHO.

Tobacco, for a while, due to the lack of research, was suggested to be perfectly safe too, because no one knows what it does to the human body.

Before anyone says marijuana is safe, I suggest people wait for the research to come in. No, the lack of consensus on this matter hardly implies research on marijuana is complete.That's like saying all food can cause fat, therefore I can eat ice cream all day.You'd have to input all soldiers manually still. You'd also have to do an additional step for figuring out a soldier's base stats. So I suggest first selecting all the perks for a given variation. Then, you should see the stat increase in all ranks for that variation. Subtract the stat increase from the soldier's current stat to figure out their base stats.She was making a light-hearted joke.Why are you guys treating this seriously... it's the funniest news I've seen in a long while, haha!Played I/I once in b15c and made it through to January with massive casualties (8 countries lost) and then I just gave up because I don't want to do 8 base assaults (Liberators on). Never again. I dislike not being able to restart missions.

I much prefer I/Bronzeman. Immersion breaking yes, but I dislike being screwed by game mechanics that doesn't make sense. Also, I **always** misclick. I/I was hell because I always clicked at the wrong time.

I/B is just that much easier... There is little difference in many areas, but the ability to restart once you know the pods is infinitely advantageous.

Brutal/I is my last successful pure Ironman game. I think it's actually harder than I/B.

There seems to be a very huge jump between Brutal and Impossible...don't really know why because the stats seem the same. Could just be because I got lucky in my B/I campaign vs. my gave up I/I campaign. I lost 32 soldiers in the latter one, but only lost like...2 in the former.More tricks! Yay!Australia is C-tier?

No way.

You can have an extremely powerful supersquad with the Australia bonus while still being versatile.

---

Oh I get it. Airgame. Meh. Australia and Russia is not that bad. A bit challenging, yes, but you can usually pull 2 interceptions. By May this drawback is near nonexistent.

---

For reference, by the lategame I'm regularly fielding a team of 105+ aim MSGTs with Australia's bonus. Really depends on the playstyle I guess, I try to roll soldiers over and over again until I get an impressive stat combo. All other soldiers are dismissed.

I suppose if people don't dismiss around 50% of their soldiers, they would find Australia's bonuses underwhelming. I find it pretty OP really. I'm regularly getting 70 aim, 14 mobility, 4 HP soldiers. Incredibly impressive.You shouldn't be taking drugs if you're not sick anyways.

Marijuana is shown to **potentially**:

- Have a strong possibility of decreasing intelligence and brain functions if consumed during the brain's development phase

- Irritate the lungs when smoked; there is little consensus on whether it causes lung cancer, however.

- Increase heart rate

- Cause problems to babies during pregnancies

There is a difference between causing major harm to the extent of potentially being carcinogenic, and causing minor harm. Drugs should not be taken when they are not needed precisely because they cause at times harmful side-effects. If you read the publications, there is debate as to how harmful marijuana truly is. There is no consensus. It can be as harmful as alcohol, or can be so harmful as to cause lung cancer and decrease in brain functions. If you're willing to take the risk that the truth ends up being in the more negative spectrum, go ahead. It's your free choice. I will not interfere with you or any efforts to legalize marijuana, but I will recommend you not do so.

Comparing turnips to marijuana is a False analogy. Whereas turnips have been shown to *not* cause adverse health effects to such a high degree when taken in moderation, we don't know what marijuana will cause, **even when only taken in moderation**. There are studies suggesting occasional use of marijuana cause problems, and there are also studies suggesting this is not so. The same does not apply for turnips.

One needs only look at history to discover that tobacco had the same controversy surrounding it. In the earlier phases, when people don't know and have not done research on what tobacco does to the human body, it was marketed as a safe drug with health benefits, even when there is a huge lack of consensus on what this drug does to your body. Today after painstaking years of research we now understand the adverse effects of tobacco.

We can not know that marijuana will end up being either a safe drug or a harmful one. What we *do* know, however, is to patiently wait for relevant research to be conducted before concluding anything.

---

Medical marijuana is not shown to be a medicine in studies and by the FDA. There is a distinct difference between *compounds within a species* being effective as a drug, and the species itself being effective as a drug.

Consider Chinese medicine and the recent Nobel Biology Prize winner. Artemisinin is an effective drug capable of tackling malaria, but the herb itself, which is used for years in Chinese medicine, Artemisia annua, is **not effective as a drug at all**. There are numerous reasons for this which I will not go into, but suffice to say, marijuana is unlikely to be, by itself, medical, but we have shown that cannabinoids is effective enough to be used in drugs.

---

I want to reiterate my stance: I personally won't condemn anyone from consuming marijuana. I also don't know if it is sinful. There are so many different viewpoints on the ethical nature of consuming marijuana and all of them makes sense to me, so I am refusing to take a definitive stance on this. However, I take a strong stance on refusing to acknowledge that enough research has been done on marijuana to conclude that it is either a safe drug, or a very bad drug. I would personally stay away from it because there are evidence suggesting that it could potentially be a bad drug. Without any consensus on this herb, the best people can do is to wait for research to proceed while being cautious of consuming it.No. We **don't know** whether marijuana is harmful yet. Do not jump to conclusions and wait for the scientists to figure it out.When I finished the Temple Ship.

Oops. Spoilers.Psi Assault build seems lacking in Will bonuses IMO. I would personally build different soldiers for EXALT and for Psi separately. Close Encounters is pretty bad late game too.

I also don't think giving Engineers without Dense Smoke a Smoke Grenade perk is such a useful choice.I'm not discounting your points, but the quote you referenced is talking about the effect of Aiming Angles on the *gameplay balance* of the game, while what you're talking about is how the SW option makes *thematic sense*.

You haven't explained why Aiming Angles contributes to the gameplay balance.I see what you mean for the engineers. LCPL perks are just not good anyways. I'd personally get a sapper engineer at LCPL but build everything else with the late game in mind to allow the engineers to be useful early game too. Later on their Sapper hardly get used, but neither do I use smoke grenades on Engineers anyways.

As for Assaults I have to disagree. With a tanking + psi oriented build, you can get up to 4~5 DR on the Assault and 70+, 80 average base Will (you will get lots of 90 MSGT Will Assaults), with ~110 after items, and 110~170 in battle. This makes for an excellent psi tank specifically oriented towards tanking Ethereal lances amidst a Muton Elite pod that you can't kill in one turn. I find that Assaults are incredibly versatile lategame, capable of having very high will (which outcompetes Medics), high DR, and excellent flanking ability on organics.***War Focused***

After lab frees up, you can research anything you want in whatever order and it doesn't really matter.

(Note: Upgrading barracks is used to dump elixir and cause a minimal increase in war weight. We don't actually need the Pekka. If you don't want to do that, you can upgrade your traps instead.)

If you do this you should aim to get 120 skull walls done by the time you finish the initial offensive upgrades. After that it will all be gold based upgrades so you may not have enough gold for walls all the time.

You don't have to do these sequentially (the BK upgrades can be done anytime you have enough DE, but preferably you finish BK to 10 in ~40 days).Find &amp; Replace is a treasured ally :)Shadow Devices only last for one turn, and you can only equip one of them per slot. I find that extremely underwhelming. For the same slot I can get a consistent 1 DR throughout a mission, a consistent 10% boost to Mind Control chance, a consistent extra 1 damage - things that I find much more useful than a failsafe item.You can only set Armor Color AFAIK in DGC.ini.

&gt; a brutal history of micromanaging people's thoughts and behaviour

I'm not sure that phrase makes sense, and if it does, describes China at all. It's impossible for a government to micromanage people's thoughts and behavior unless you install a chip in their bodies. Does the government micromanage when to brush your teeth...no.

Banning couples from feeding each other in the cafeteria is not micromanagement, it's just being silly.

Please don't overanalyze trivial news like this...there are better things to be worried about.France council requests are very good. Australia start is powerful if you actively filter soldiers (i.e. dismissing a lot of the bad ones). These are the only two that I've tried.&gt; splash first then AD or AT then cannons

Bad habit if you're into war.

AD/Sweeper/Traps/tesla should be first at TH8. Low war weight and helps defend against lower-tier attacks faster.

Mortars have extremely high war weight but is near useless. Wizard Towers are more useful but nevertheless have a high war weight.How is this humor?

You see this all across academia, not just in sociology. Physics, mathematics, biology, computer science. For example, strange, charm; a proof is trivial, etc.

Academia sometimes is just a bit lazy to create a new word to describe different things.

In STEM fields most important definitions are rigorously defined, concise, and precise. Not all the time in sociology. Here's hoping for change in that regard.I'd rather not read or watch some random Youtuber's rebuttal.

Give me an academic essay dissecting the speech, if there's even one. This rebuttal is as good as Watson's speech.That is *brainwashing*, not *micromanagement*.

I do argue semantics too much, but I dislike imprecise terminology.

Micromanaging a person's thoughts and behavior does not make sense. *Brainwashing* a person's thoughts and behavior makes sense.

I don't really want to get into a debate because of this silly article. It is boring and frankly the same thing has been repeated over and over again.Seems so.I only use Combat Drugs smoke.

After the radius nerf I find Dense Smoke extremely underwhelming. It used to be equal to Combat Drugs for me.That is just torture + brainwashing. How is that micromanagement?

I can't find any essays with both "micromanagement" and "Yan'an".Haha, you painstakingly telling redditors that they have accidentally reposted with such a hostile attitude is surely groundbreaking and changing the world for the better...while you yourself do it too ;)

That woman probably is going to do more for changing the world for the better than you do.I didn't see your edit, and your edit makes sense in how it is micromanagement.Or use Combat Drugs on the gunner, the psion, the crit infantry...

The gunner suppresses, gets 20 defense + 45 in heavy cover, aliens attack him; the psion gets boost to will for a 95% mind control chance now, the crit infantry gets a clean 100% crit chance shot; the radius is large enough to cover the MEC too.

Not to mention plenty of aliens will just throw grenades at you if you use Dense Smoke.

I never use Smoke Grenades on engineers, so I don't take either Dense Smoke or Smoke Grenades as perks. That's just your playstyle. Taking Battle Scanner as a perk means I can now make room to bring four more flashbangs, or four more chem grenades, or a shadow device.

Scouts with flush synergize very well with debilitating engineers. A chem grenade/a flashbang + a flush on a Muton Elite = alien self-flank.

I very much prefer actually debilitating the aliens than throwing defensive smoke on myself. The former means their aim gets reduced along with their grenade range, their movement, and so on. The latter just invites grenades.&gt; ...which means you're running a damage grenade Engineer without Mayhem

Um, no...? I'm not running a damage grenade Engineer build either.

My builds are pretty controversial back in the b15c days, but they worked for me, so that's good enough for me. My playstyle hinges on my class builds. Without understanding how I play you can't call it awful. You don't have enough information to reach that conclusion.

I use my engineers primarily for debilitating purposes. I do *not* use them for damage grenades. I do *not* use them for defensive purposes (smoke grenades). With such a paradigm in mind, they are able to carry perks that make them very versatile.

I let Archers and rocketeers handle AOE damage. Medics can handle defensive grenades.&gt; it wildly excels at

The thing is, I disagree with this. Medics can do smoke grenades as well as Engineers while having the option to use Combat Drugs, and have a solid defensive Psi build. Medics are better than an engineer at defending a squad.

Engineers, while being able to deal good damage with grenades, are rapidly outshined by Archers and Rocketeers. Furthermore, their grenades can't hit air troops easily. If I want AOE damage I'd bring Archers.

So I bring an engineer for debilitation. Thing is debilitation doesn't require many perks since the grenades do most of the job. All they need are S&amp;M, Grenadier, Packmaster, and Bombard. That means I have a lot of freedom in choosing the rest of the perks.

Since engineers have bad aim, I'm not going to let them shoot.

Since there are classes who tank better than Engineers, I'm not going to let them suppress or give them tank perks.

That means I give Engineers perks that no one else wants. But they're surprisingly good at it. So I kept it the same way ever since.

Grenadier | Sapper/Holo | S&amp;M | Repair | BS | Packmaster | Bombard

You're such a funny guy, are you cut? ;)Lol mraPure bad luck. :(Please don't do this :(

If you don't make it please know that I will silently be saluting you, even if I don't know anything about you IRL. o7I did 3 Australia campaigns so I know what I'm getting into ;)

Used to it.Angelababy only works when people least expect itBetter: they get squadsight eventually ;)Because they don't live in HK anymore to give an informed answer.....?????????Yep I get psi lanced from nowhere sometimes late into the campaign.Check the perk list yourself.Aggressive and some dose of luck ensures I have crashed scouts throughout the early game. After you expand the issue becomes less heightened. You can typically get 2 interceptors going for a single scout so it isn't that big of a deal. Raiders and fighters are a real concern.

I don't understand where people get the idea you can't get any crashed scouts in Australia.Sounds cool.

But what is the story of EXALT? Aren't they aliens sympathizers? Or merely humans who sought to grab the alien's powers through whatever means for their own benefits?Says the racist. Why should I care what you sayHa! I'm hardly liberal. I just despise racism.

&gt; Because the Chinese are fucking moronic

Go on. I don't need to take you seriously.OP specifically asked whether there is a difference in life quality *before and after* the transfer. The HKers in Vancouver won't be able to informedly answer the question.Typical racist conservative attitude ;)

Why don't you have a drink with the real retarded liberal in our sub, something something saurus.

Were you American? Glad our country is rid of you. Stay in China and don't come back.I did not treat Watson's speech seriously either.

I can't take the feminists or the rebuttals seriously if they're just going to repeat the same thing over and over again. It's boring.LOL pathetic.inb4 shitshow of people telling OP they are endangering lives by playing CoCOr maybe they included the grass in the modelI personally push Plasma to February and later and start pumping my airgame up by doing lategame air research and Firestorms.

Randomness of events will see clumping. Clumping is a random behavior.I'm sick of you. I cannot handle this anymore. I'll have you know my dad is a senior member in CCP and you'll shortly be arrested by Australian police and deported to China, where you'll be interrogated for your mischief on Reddit in smearing the good and wholesome family-friendly pro-China commentators. CCP is severely threatened by your anti-China comments on Reddit and our internal structure is crumbling because of all the dangerous news you post. We cannot allow this continue.

Be very frightened because tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. a woman named Rainy and a man named Rocky will unlock your door and kidnap you leaving absolutely no trace of your existence. You'll be erased from Australian, Chinese, and UN records, and CCP secret technology will delete all memory of you from people who know you. Thankfully the procedure in your case will be shorter and easier than most others.

Disagree with this. Sound cues tell you a lot. On sparse maps (crashed scouts) dashing is perfectly acceptable and is one of the better ways to get meld efficiently IMO.

I met a young man a few years ago while working with a law firm on a case involving China. We were among a few Chinese who had been hired to translate documents. All of us were working more or less honestly in our respective capacities, but every day he sat in front of his computer, chatted with anyone who would answer him, or mostly got online to do whatever he was doing. Now and then, he would say to the rest of us, \u201cWhy rush? Slow down so we will log more hours!\u201d Or, twirling in his office chair, \u201cThe Americans are dumb! They don\u2019t have any idea how much we can do!\u201d So disgusted was I to hear this and so enraged that he dared to include me with him in the same breath. For days on, I was haunted by that smug look he wore on his face. How I know that look, how I know such crookedness, by heart!  What was more appalling to me was that he was a recent graduate of the University of Maryland, he had come to the US in his teenage years to join one of his parents, and, in other words, he had spent a significant portion of his formative years in the US. But instead of shaping his values, America was this wonderful place filled with dumb people for him to take advantage of! And he is by no means a singularity among Chinese living in America.

To many Chinese, Americans don\u2019t have xin-yan (\u5fc3\u773c, meaning,  literally, eyes of the mind; or figuratively, calculating, wily), they trust what you say, and they believe you are doing what you say you are doing. For that, they are dumb.

I know a writer from my hometown who writes with unusual perception and style. But I remember how surprised I was reading an essay of his a few years back. He mused on this distant place called America, how it was such a young country and, in mentality, like an imprudent teenage boy showing no consideration for things, how na\u00efve Americans seem to him with no depth and no appreciation for subtler things. I know exactly from what corner these thoughts arose and why he perceived America and Americans the way he did.  In some ways, it was not unlike de Tocqueville, the old-worlder, but through the unique filter of Chinese wisdom. For him (again, he is not a singularity), to speak your mind straightforwardly, to defend your position forcefully, and to uphold what you believe without compromise, are all signs of childishness.  A lot of Americans, alas, fill that bill.

I once told him, \u201cYou are an exceptional writer with discerning eyes and a superb sense of style, but I find your writing wanting, because, ultimately, you cannot write from a morally compromised position. At the most crucial junctures in your writing, you tend to hide even if you have to lie, obscure it  or stop halfway,  and you fail to snap it into its right place.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to hear any of this. He probably thinks I am stupid, not knowing the so-called art of the unspoken.

A college friend of mine organized a reunion party in her house last time I visited Beijing. Over the course of the conversation, one of the \u201cgirls\u201d (well, we are not girls anymore, but\u2026) stopped abruptly, commenting to the party, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel refreshed when you hear Yaxue talk?\u201d It would be a nice compliment that I didn\u2019t deserve but would enjoy anyway, if she didn\u2019t turn to me and look at me in such an ambiguous way that, for a while, I couldn\u2019t decide what she really meant. \u201cDoesn\u2019t she sound earnest and pure?\u201d She pursued the others for agreement.  The girl sitting next to me said, \u201cShe has lived too long in America.\u201d She might have patted on my back. By now I had heard all the undertones and was positively annoyed: To her ear, I sounded na\u00efve and simplistic. The problem was, I had no idea how she had reached that conclusion. I had made no big speech; in fact, I had hardly talked at all. I had not seen them for years, didn\u2019t know what to say, and for most of the part I just asked what they did and where they lived, etc. as they themselves talked about all sorts of subjects:  job, house, children, society, news of other classmates, etc.

To many Chinese, the guilelessness on a face, the heartiness of a voice, or/and the confidence with which a person carries herself/himself can all seem rather sha (\u50bb\uff0cfoolish, simple-minded).

Whenever I hear a fellow Chinese say or hint that the Chinese are \u201csmart\u201d and the Americans are \u201csimple,\u201d I would quickly point out that wisdom is not universal. Instead, it is relative and product of a particular society. *The Chinese \u201cwisdom\u201d they cherish so much and feel so smart about is really just habits they have developed in a totalitarian, oppressive, and in many ways odious society. It\u2019s nothing but the mold that grows in a dark and wet place.*

When I told my brother that a lot of Chinese thought Americans were dumb, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s a dumb thing to say. *If they are so smart, why aren\u2019t they doing anything better than the Americans?*\u201d This is the question, I bet, those Chinese who believe that the Americans are dumb have not asked themselves.Do the Chinese Lie? That Depends\u2026

Out in my neck of the woods, it is not uncommon to hear a businessperson from a Western country, following a disappointing episode with a Chinese supplier, say something like: \u201cThey\u2019re all a bunch of liars!\u201d  Of course, they\u2019re not all bad. Part of the problem is very different definitions of what constitutes ethical and honest behavior between the Chinese and the Western world (Note: I\u2019d include the Japanese in the group of people who don\u2019t understand Chinese \u201clying\u201d).

In short, for most Chinese people, lying is not really lying. What we in the West would consider to be a bald-faced lie, a person in greater China might think of as a courtesy, a convenience, or a smart tactic, none of which are immoral. In fact, lying to achieve some business or social aim, and getting away with it, is considered to be a sign of intelligence and social skill among many Chinese.

Chinese values are rooted in concepts of duty to oneself, one\u2019s family, one\u2019s company, one\u2019s friends and associates, but not to anyone else. There is no \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d ethic going on; kids are not really taught from a young age that they have a duty to help strangers. The teaching is more along the lines of \u201cdon\u2019t make trouble,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t do anything shameful,\u201d or \u201cbe a good student.\u201d

Also worth noting is the fact that many more things are covered up by the Chinese than they would be in the West. People don\u2019t tell each other about things that would make someone lose face or cause social embarrassment, and once the \u201cdeception\u201d is discovered, all is generally forgiven after a brief explanation along the lines of \u201cit wasn\u2019t convenient for me to tell you the truth.\u201d Things like job loss, serious illness, legal trouble, or problems with children are seldom talked about, and often kept hidden, even among close friends and relatives.

In a business context, you might not hear about a shipment that was supposed to go out last week but will now likely never go out until it is too late. This occurs with great frequency in greater China, and there is very little concern or shame on the Chinese end, because it simply isn\u2019t viewed as being wrong.

For the unprepared Western businessperson, these ethics can be quite unnerving. I\u2019ve personally seen many a business deal, and many a friendship, fall apart because of these radically different values.

The Bottom Line: Don\u2019t expect your Chinese suppliers to have the same set of ethics that you have. There are differences across the board in what constitutes ethical behavior when you\u2019re talking about East and West. Tread carefully, and set up plenty of checks and balances until you really know what you are doing.

Some may see this post as repetitive: we all know Chinese people tend to lie. But through my conversations with posters in this sub, I've come to realize people don't seem to understand that, in Chinese mentality, their lies are not lies.
They don't know they are lying when they lie. It is so perfectly natural to lie that in a way, it's no longer a lie in that society.With that crappy design and high loot I would've gone for that base too.&gt; being genuine, trusting and up-front is naive or stupid

This is what modern Chinese society in general believes.

As a sidenote, I highly doubt Communism caused this. Such mentality has always existed in Chinese society to a greater degree (IMO) than in others, as can be seen through the high volume of Chinese literature before 1949 examining such mentality.

Yet I think there are elements within Chinese society that understands the hazards of such mentality. The word "\u5c0f\u806a\u660e" lit. "little cleverness" refers to actions that seem very clever but ultimately petty, such as avoiding taxes.

However, I think Chinese people who stereotype Americans as being dumb are actually those who have met them. There is a sharp divide between Chinese people who have exposure to America: those who can't fit in American society because they are too ingrained in their previous culture; these people usually tend to deride Americans as being stupid for trusting and being direct. The others understand the virtues of American culture and are able to contrast it with the pitfalls of Chinese culture. These are the ones that usually combine the essences of both culture in their daily lives and act graciously.Yes, I noticed the "link" doesn't actually exist, so I copy-pasted it here. If you need a VPN just read the comment above.

http://chinachange.org/2011/09/04/dumb-americans/

I linked to the commentary because it is shorter and more succinct.&gt; For an American to assume that everything they do is better than what the Chinese can do, that only reinforces the stereotype being discussed ITT.

The reason why I feel confident to say this is because the Chinese I've met in the workforce and academia all echo this opinion. I've literally met no exception. (BTW, yes, I have an obvious case of sample bias going here because the people I've met and talked to to get this deep are obviously those I like and share beliefs with in the first place)

America is heavily idealized to the point of distortion by Chinese people who are sick and tired of the less desirable elements in Chinese culture. I think Americans are less than completely trusting and honest, but it implies that the \u52fe\u5fc3\u6597\u89d2 (calculating) in Chinese society has a really negative and severe effect on people's mental health. I know Chinese people who immigrated to America saying that their whole lives have been nothing but to guess what someone really means, be constantly wary of betrayals, even among family. America has this, but to a much lesser degree. The Chinese part of my family also went through this ordeal.

It's a very personal affair for many of them, and it is not nice to demean the pressure they've been through in an attempt to whitewash Chinese culture.

In many areas, America is doing many things much better than China. It isn't a fair comparison because China is still a developing country, but nevertheless America is still overall simply better.&gt; animal carcass

It's a kind of massive nationwide not-give-a-fuckism, combined with Mao protecting his "face" that caused the deaths of millions.&gt; Just as valid as the wests

Actually, I have to disagree.

Chinese ethics is based on the Confucian concept of dividing social hierarchy into blocks. There is the Guo (nation), the Jia (family), then yourself, etc.

The initial meaning of \u56fd\u5bb6 is **not** a state in the modern sense. It refers to the "country" led by a family, hence the combination of two distinct words.

So the notion of Guo, and Jia is closer than most think. By creating responsibility into blocks, and make a hierarchy out of them, people are led to prioritize the block itself, rather than the people.

This is a huge problem from a practical viewpoint because the block is too abstract for most people to comprehend well. Responsibility towards the block is thus fleeting and no more consequential than being patriotic and scolding Japanese on forums.

Thus under the hierarchy, we focus on the family and oneself the most. There is no concept of helping strangers at all because what matters is how you help the *block*, not the *people in the block*.

By limiting people to work for an artificial construct that ultimately benefits no one, Chinese people feel a sense of responsibility to...basically a concept devised by a man thousands of years ago. Christianity on the other hand preaches to help thy neighbor, and focuses on the very real people. No matter whether you believe in Christianity or not, such a view has disseminated into mainstream European societies and thus is a natural part of everyone's lives. This is why I don't think Chinese ethics is as valid as the West. Your whole responsibility is tied to a construct, a concept, something intangible. At least in Western society some *parts* of your responsibility is tied to things that are tangible, prompting actual action.&gt; completely oblivious

I have to say this is very True personally. I know such a gap exist, but I don't know what it really is, the magnitude of it; I simply can't comprehend it. Things are worse since I rarely interact with people outside of my social groups.International schools are basically an expensive ticket to get into American, British, Canadian, Australian, etc. universities.

\u6587\u827a\u9752\u5e74 is sometimes a derogatory term describing people who do humanities and can't find a job. It's not a subculture. Similar to how STEM people here look down on history majors... (guilty)

\u5c0f\u6e05\u65b0 is an extremely popular modern culture that assigns the value of natural beauty, minimalism, feel-good above all else. A great way to escape urban dread. Definitely NOT a subculture since everyone is more or less affected by it today.

Middle and rich Chinese teenagers couldn't care less about \u6740\u9a6c\u7279 and find it stupid and ridiculous. I doubt it will break into mainstream.

BTW, the way \u975e\u4e3b\u6d41 is used as a derogatory term in China is different from how "hipster" is used. "Hipster" primarily mocks the "I wanna feel different" mentality of hipsters, while \u975e\u4e3b\u6d41 primarily mocks the absurdity of what the hipsters do. Used with friends it's more lighthearted. E.g.:

"Wow, you polished your nails green. So ugly! Are you becoming a \u975e\u4e3b\u6d41?"*International Baccalaureate.

Had to see this thing's posters over and over again now the correct spelling is etched into my mind.&gt; experts theorize that we are increasingly isolating ourselves further. Instead of talking to/watching/reading things that are put in front of us, we can easily just pick our friends, media, etc. We end up picking things that reinforce our beliefs, and avoiding things that question our beliefs. It has never been easier to find our mirror image in regards to beliefs/outlook/etc, and this is very isolating.

This is a very interesting and intuitive way of explaining such behavior.Try out valkyries&gt; China has had 5000 years and never been even a fraction as wealthy or free.

This is actually False. First, China did not strictly have 5000 years of continuous history; China was also extremely wealthy and intellectually advanced from 200 AD all the way till 1300 AD. China was richer than America relative to the whole world in that era.

The problem is today's China is nothing like the enlightened past. Italy can't use the glory of Rome to show anything about today's Italy.LOL is this what it feels like to teach Chinese kids?Falling for the b8LOLSPEC on a landed anything beyond April = asking for troubleNo, they're not the only subculture.

Also STEM people tend to not grasp the fact that a history major does not go on to do history as their job. That's because a comp. sci major does go on to do comp. sci, a biology major goes on to do biology, and the most extreme "change of field" in the STEM bubble is \*gasp* going to an investment bank to do math for 14 hours a day.

A lot of STEM majors think they can get As as easily in STEM as they could in the humanities. Ask them to write a paper...boohoo

It's really an undergrad thing. I don't think adults actually think that. But you know...most Chinese never got past undergrad.Um....

I'm also called a pro-CCP shill so I no longer really care if people call me "too negative" or "too positive".

I'm not living in China right now anyways. How is what I've said "negative"? I didn't say Chinese culture is all bad. I mentioned that:

&gt; there are elements within Chinese society that understands the hazards of such mentality

&gt; The others [Chinese immigrants] understand the virtues of American culture and are able to contrast it with the pitfalls of Chinese culture. These are the ones that usually **combine the essences** of **both culture** in their daily lives and **act graciously**.

, which implies Chinese culture isn't all bad.

I don't dislike Chinese people. I dislike **modern Chinese culture**. I don't even really care about the CCP since I think it's a phenomenon in part created by corrupt elements in Chinese culture.

I wrote a rant a while ago on why I think Chinese culture is corrupted. That is not to say I think other cultures are free from blight, it is only because I lived a huge part of my life as both an insider **and** outsider in China that I am able to identify what is wrong with Chinese culture. I also read modern Chinese literature and most of my opinions are really echoing what others have said. I rarely come up with my own opinion; most of what I think is a synthesis of what I've read from books, essays and critiques.GDP: http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/08/history-of-world-gdp/

I personally see \u6587\u827a\u9752\u5e74 mostly used for mocking...but that probably just shows what kind of people I hang out with :P.My wake up call was when I realized I can't write good academic essays in Chinese. It was an advanced literature course, and our essays are expected to be written in Chinese. I find myself writing extremely long sentences that simply didn't feel natural. Cue the sample essays, and I discovered I simply can't express my ideas in Chinese that well.

I mostly speak Chinese and Cantonese in school and with friends during high school, and with some of my extended Chinese side of family and family friends from Taiwan and the mainland, but never at home. I have little exposure to academic texts in Chinese.

That's probably my greatest confidence shaker... I always thought despite being a foreigner I would be at the same level as Chinese natives because I lived in China for a while, but that didn't turn out to be True when I see the level of work they are doing in a rigorous setting.

Still, I understand mainland and HK colloquial speech and can converse with someone about anything in Chinese. Just not actually write it out. I also have that "foreigner" accent that doesn't go away.... They do say I sound like a Taiwanese, which doesn't make sense since I've never lived in Taiwan.Ask on zhidao.baidu.com

Sorry to say but \u5c31 is gonna give you quite the headache :(

It's not gonna be easy, but good luck!While it is an insult, you are likely not going to offend anyone unless you explicitly say something along the lines of "\u4f60\u5f88\u4e8c\u6b38\uff01"Let's generalize the matter first. When you simply want to say *difference*, any of the variants are exactly the same; there isn't even any connotations when you mean precisely *difference*.

----

are all exactly the same thing; or if they ever had different meanings in this context, are too diluted for it to matter.

However, each of the variants have a specific meaning slightly different from *difference* that is unique.

\u5206\u522b can be a noun or a verb meaning *to leave each other*, e.g.:

---

\u4ed6\u4eec\u6700\u540e\u7a76\u7adf\u8fd8\u662f\u53ea\u80fd**\u5206\u522b**

Alas, [despite everything], they nevertheless could only **leave each other.**

---

\u5dee\u522b could mean *difference* in terms of expectation vs. reality. However, \u533a\u522b and \u5206\u522b still works, albeit being a bit more rarely used, e.g.:

---

\u8fd9\u4e2a\u624b\u673a\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u91cc**\u5dee\u522b**\u592a\u5927\u4e86\u5427\uff01

The [real] phone and what was advertised is way too **different!**

---

\u5dee\u522b is also more commonly used when explaining *difference* in skill level, age, etc. (things that have an associated superiority vs. inferiority):

---

\u4ed6\u7684\u5fb7\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u5dee\u522b\u7684\u3002

His Deutsch skills still has a **difference** from mine.

---

In addition, \u5dee\u522b is most commonly used only as a noun. Do NOT say this:

---

\u4ed6\u628a\u8fd9\u4e24\u4ef6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u5dee\u522b\u51fa\u6765\u3002

He **differentiated** the two different objects.

---

Wrong!

You can only say:

---

\u4ed6\u628a\u8fd9\u4e24\u4ef6\u7269\u54c1\u533a\u522b\u51fa\u6765\u3002

or

\u4ed6\u628a\u8fd9\u4e24\u4ef6\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u522b\u51fa\u6765\u3002

He **differentiated** the two objects.

---

\u5206\u522b can also mean to identify as a verb:

---

\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5e2e\u5fd9**\u5206\u522b**\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f

Can you help me **identify** this?

---

\u5206\u522b can also mean separately

---

\u4ed6\u4eec\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u5165\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u5ba4

They **separately** went into different classrooms.

---



\u5206 itself means *to separate*, \u533a itself means to *differentiate*.

---

Whereas it is natural for one to say \u5e2e\u5fd9\u5206\u522b\u8fd9\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48,

It is not natural for one to say \u5e2e\u5fd9\u533a\u522b\u8fd9\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e1c\u897f

---

\u533a\u522b means to identify, but only used on differences:

\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5e2e\u5fd9**\u533a\u522b**\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684*\u5dee\u522b*\uff1f

Can you help me **identify** the *differences* between these two?

However, you can **also** use \u5206\u522b in this case.

You cannot use \u533a\u522b to substitute \u5206\u522b for identify though. Think of \u533a\u522b being a subset of \u5206\u522b when meaning "identify".

---

The other variants are MUCH easier:

---


\u8d26\u6237 - any account related to money management

\u5e10\u6237 - any account

You can say your Reddit account as: \u6211\u7684Reddit\u5e10\u6237, but preferably not \u6211\u7684Reddit\u8d26\u6237

These are interchangeable and no one really cares.

\u8fde\u63a5\u7ebf - connection wire: HDMI cable is a \u8fde\u63a5\u7ebf

\u7535\u7ebf - layman terms for any electricity/electrical signal carrying line or collection thereof. HDMI cable can be called a \u7535\u7ebf too, but most people don't call the power supply for your PC a \u8fde\u63a5\u7ebf.

\u7535\u7f06 - technical term for any collection of electricity/electrical signal carrying wire, usually enclosed in an insulator. The technical definition of \u7535\u7ebf is ONLY a single wire, but most layman don't know that, so they use \u7535\u7ebf for everything.

To be even more precise, the \u7ebf in \u7535\u7ebf means line, or string; \u7f06 means a thick cyclical structure, such as \u7f06\u7ef3 (thick rope), \u94a2\u7f06 (thick steel wirerope).

#Abstract

How have Chinese migrant workers\u2019 patterns of everyday life changed over the past two decades, and what has not changed? Have their personal and career aspirations shifted over time? What changes have occurred in how they maintain social relationships within and across factories? What are the implications for migrant workers, local governance and factory managements? Based on workers\u2019 letters and ethnographic research in Shenzhen, this article argues that migrant workers encounter very different circumstances today in their housing, food, time scheduling, aspirations and ways of maintaining social relationships. yet young migrant workers still invoke social relationships steeped in links to family and village to cope with daily difficulties. I examine the workers\u2019 greater control over their time, local governments\u2019 growing need to accommodate migrant workers\u2019 requirements in order to maintain social stability, and the increasing pressure on factory managements to consider workers\u2019 work/leisure arrangements, especially during peak industrial seasons.

---

Given China\u2019s role as the world\u2019s factory, the past two decades have seen an enormous proliferation of research on Chinese migrant workers from the perspectives of gender,^[1] citizenship,^[2] culture,^[3] working conditions,^[4] living conditions,^[5] representation,^[6] social networks,^[7] agency,^[8] labor organizations,^[9] migration,^[10] cross-generation differences,^[11] class formation^[12] and comparative labor regimes.^[13] The conventional approach in studying Chinese migrant workers is the \u201csubjugation model\u201d. This perceives Chinese migrant workers\u2019 subjugation to various structural and institutional forces, manifested in China\u2019s household registration policy, permit system and factory sweatshops, and in gender and locality/kinship discrimination. These structural and institutional forces in turn provide conditions for the incubation of exploitative and suppressive shop-floor cultures in workplaces. According to this approach, the plight of Chinese migrant workers is the direct consequence of China\u2019s re-integration into the global economy and the Chinese state\u2019s modernization strategies to attract foreign capital investment.^[14]

One line of argument in the subjugation model is the \u201cdormitory labor\u201d thesis. Pun Ngai and Chris Smith, in particular, have forcefully articulated an argument about the distinctiveness of a \u201cdormitory labor regime\u201d to capture total control over the lives of Chinese migrant workers. According to Pun and Smith, in order to extend migrant workers\u2019 working hours to meet demand in the global production cycle, the management of foreign-funded factories in south China built dormitories close to the production facilities, which enabled employers to exercise power not only over employment but also over employees\u2019 after-hours activities.^[15] As will be seen, the social and material conditions of factory workers in the early 1990s, revealed in their private letters, lends evidence to support the dormitory labor thesis.

Even today, when studying migrant workers some scholars still emphasize the dormitory labor regime^[16] while paying scant attention to workers\u2019 lives outside the factory complex, even though many migrant factory workers today rent rooms in nearby neighborhoods. During my fieldwork in 2010, I resided for a number of months with migrant workers in a local industrial village near Shenzhen. Apart from observing their daily lives, I was able to discuss with my flatmates their working conditions, labor regime and social relationships on the shop floor. I gradually realized that the subjugation model, while casting light on many issues, cannot be extended to their social and material lives. Their lifestyle is dramatically different from the after-work lives of migrant factory workers in the 1990s. This article does not dismiss the importance of factory management\u2019s domination over workers inside factories during working hours but it will focus on workers\u2019 social and material life. To understand how workers\u2019 lives have changed and the effect of these changes on the subjugation model, before examining the everyday life of migrant workers in the late 2000s I first attempt to identify the characteristics of migrant workers\u2019 daily lives near Shenzhen in the early 1990s.#The Conditions of Shenzhen\u2019s Migrant Workers in the Early 1990s

Evidence for the early 1990s derives partly from 76 private letters written or received by workers at Zhili Toy Factory, which was located in an industrial village near Shenzhen. The Zhili factory was owned and run by a Hong Kong businessman, and manufactured toys for a European toy company. In 1993, a fire engulfed the factory, killing over 80 workers and severely burning many dozens more. The deceased workers\u2019 letters were discarded by the factory. A pile of them was found in the rubbish by a Beijing-based academic, who provided photocopies to an Australian scholar,^[17] who in turn provided copies to me. Some of these letters had been written by Zhili workers but not yet mailed before the workers\u2019 deaths, but most had been sent to the Zhili workers by friends and relatives who worked in other factories. Many of the letters contain details of workers\u2019 social and material conditions, the workers\u2019 attitudes towards their working lives, marriages and romantic affairs, and their relationships with other family members, fellow villagers, friends and co-workers.

In the industrial village where the factory was located, the village government had converted agricultural land into industrial zones and built factory buildings and dormitories, seeking to attract investors. The Zhili factory dormitory consisted of one building within the factory complex. Each bedroom was approximately 20 square meters, and housed ten double-decker bunk beds. Along the outer wall of the overcrowded dormitory, a tarpaulin had been erected to accommodate an additional 30 or so double bunk beds. To enter the dormitory, one had to squeeze through narrow gaps between the outdoor bedding. There were over 200 workers in the dormitory, but fewer than five showers and toilets. Even in winter, no hot water was supplied to the bathroom.^[18] When the fire broke out, workers could not escape because the management had put iron bars on the windows and locked the dormitory and factory gates to prevent theft.

The Zhili dormitory was characteristic of China\u2019s foreign-funded factories of the early 1990s. A special spatial arrangement was in use to appropriate Chinese workers\u2019 labor power. Although workers could leave the point of production and go back to their dormitory, factory managers monitored, controlled and physically entrapped them at all times. Through this, factory management had near-absolute control over workers\u2019 labor and leisure time and could flexibly utilize and prolong labor time whenever they wished.

Letters left behind by the workers who died in the fire reveal a typical factory timetable of the early 1990s.^[19] After waking at 6:00 a.m., workers had to queue up outside the bathroom and wait to wash. They left the dormitory by 6:45 a.m., ate breakfast quickly (15 minutes) and rushed to the factory to punch their time cards before 7:00 a.m. to avoid being tagged as \u201clate for work\u201d. During the five-hour morning shift, they would drink only a little, to avoid having to go to the toilet too often. Lunchtime was between noon and 1:00 p.m., and some workers rushed their lunch to give themselves time for a quick nap. At 1:00 p.m., the factory bell rang, and they had to punch their cards again and resume work for another four hours until 5:00 p.m., followed by an hour for dinner, after which the factory bell rang and the card was punched again. Their evening shift lasted until 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. Although the workers were hungry and exhausted after a very long day\u2019s work, their letters showed that they still had to queue up for half an hour to take a shower and eat something before going to bed.

In the early 1990s, a normal working day in Shenzhen was at least 12 hours, and lengthy overtime work was considered a part of the normal working day. In some cases, workers had to work even longer, up to 15 hours. According to one of the Zhili letters, workers at the writer\u2019s factory had to work up to 27 hours non-stop to fill rush orders in peak seasons. Extremely long working hours blatantly violated the Chinese Labor Law of 1995, but my own and others\u2019 research has shown that, even after this law was passed, it was the norm for Shenzhen employers to violate regulations on working hours at will.

Factory employers fined workers for being late to work. According to various Zhili letters, workers who went to the bathroom without a \u201cleave-work-station-permit\u201d were fined one yuan. Absence from work without a supervisor\u2019s permission incurred a fine of 30 yuan for the first day and 15 yuan for the second. In some cases, even a leave of absence with the permission of supervisors could still bring a fine of 15 yuan per day. Refusal to do an overtime shift was penalized by a fine of two yuan the first time, four yuan the second, eight yuan the third time, and deduction of all wages for the fourth.^[20] Under this despotic time-regime, migrant workers in the early 1990s had to adjust their biological clock from rural rhythms to these draconian rhythms of factory life, at the expense of their physical well-being. Some of the letters mentioned various types of work-related ailments, lack of sleep, and exhaustion from their long hours of work.

Many workers also mentioned going hungry. The letters found at Zhili revealed that workers at some factories had only two meals a day, though some said three. As they had to engage in physical work for at least 12 hours a day, the level of hunger felt by the women working can be imagined. To most workers, a position that allowed them to have three meals every day was considered desirable employment.

What amount and kind of food was normally served in a meal? A worker remarked in a letter that for dinner she could \u201chave two dishes containing some meat, and one entirely of vegetables\u201d. Another woman worker wrote that she had to share two dishes with five other workers. They needed to eat a lot of rice to bolster an insufficient diet, so as to have enough calories to do a day\u2019s work. Factory canteens provided a very low quality of rice, a fact which workers resented. A male worker wrote: \u201cI do not want to eat a single mouthful of the rice provided in this factory\u201d. Some workers wrote to ask family members in their home village to send them home-grown rice and noodles. Even though they had gone to work in a factory to supplement their family\u2019s income at home, these Chinese migrant workers were still connected to the means of subsistence in their home villages. This enabled factory owners to lower a worker\u2019s wage even below subsistence level.

In the 76 Zhili workers\u2019 letters, 24 mentioned how much they earned. Fifteen said that the wages were too low so they had no savings, 13 told of sending money home, 12 referred to borrowing and lending money, and 11 commented on irregular pay.^[21]A female worker, upon receiving a loan from her younger sister working in another factory, wrote in reply:

&gt; I received your money on 25 March [1992]. I am happy. Actually, sister, please don\u2019t send me money any more. I finally got my wages. On 15 March [1992], factory management paid my wages for work done in December [1991]. I got 140 yuan. I have already sent 100 yuan home. I am preparing to send next month\u2019s money for elder brother\u2019s expenditures. Sister, please keep and save some money for your own use. Being away from home, everything costs money.

Far from home and with little time for a social life, a recurrent theme with these migrant workers was loneliness. In letters mailed before important Chinese festivals such as the mid-autumn festival, a number wrote that they were desperate to have their siblings, friends and fellow villagers visit them. For example:

&gt; Sisters, will you return home this year? I am so desperate to return home. If you decide to go home, can we go together? By the way, do you have a mid-autumn festival holiday? If you have, come to my factory to have fun, ok? I miss you two so much!In many cases, however, such visits were not possible because factory management restricted workers\u2019 leave time. As a young worker told her elder sister: \u201cAlthough I said I would go to your factory to have fun, now I can\u2019t because my factory doesn\u2019t let me take a holiday\u201d. Workers who could not leave their factories or have friends visit could only ask their friends to send them photos.
Even though these relationships were so important, they could sometimes become a burden to workers, particularly when workers were asked to introduce relatives and fellow villagers into the factories where they worked and to vouch for them with employers. Under strong obligations to help out, when workers failed to obtain factory jobs for relatives and fellow villagers they had to apologize for disappointing them.

The migrant workers often lent money to each other. Lending money to a friend in need was a means of sustaining relationships, but it could also be risky, especially lending to newly arrived fellow villagers. Migrant workers had little savings and relied on very low wages, and it was possible that the money lent to fellow villagers would never be returned. In some cases, lending or refusing to lend money destroyed friendships, which could be catastrophic to the letter-writers. Keeping up relationships with fellow villagers was indispensable, not just socially and emotionally, but also to obtain labor market information: to know which factory had good conditions, which factory had a vacancy and so on.

As the letters reveal, workers in the early 1990s had very low career aspirations, and fatalism prevailed. They did not have any vision other than returning eventually to their home villages to farm. In the meantime, they only hoped that they could work in \u201cgood\u201d factories. Thirty-eight out of 76 letters mentioned trying to find work at another factory (this ranked highest among all issues appearing in the letters).^[22] To Chinese workers in the 1990s, working in good factories meant having enough food to eat, management paying wages on time, and being allowed to take leave to return home to visit families or to visit friends in other factories.

In sum, Chinese migrant workers\u2019 lives in the early 1990s were characterized by marginal material survival, harsh factory rhythms and a sense of isolation. Female workers were particularly trapped by rigid social roles and family relationships, and could not escape the fate of returning to the countryside and becoming peasants again after their years of urban factory life.

#New Patterns of Everyday Life among Chinese Migrant Workers in the 2000s

Around 2000, local villagers in the Shenzhen region began to demolish their old village houses and construct multistory buildings in order to rent tiny apartments to migrant workers who wanted to avoid living in factory dormitories. Gradually, the local villagers became a new propertied class, living in middle-class comfort on rents and on their village\u2019s collective income from leasing out factory sites.

Jade Village, where I did my fieldwork in 2010, witnessed these changes. I lived there for six months with three male migrant workers in a shared flat. Within this half-year, I not only observed and recorded details of these young workers\u2019 daily routines and leisure activities but also collected life histories from other workers in the community (young and old, male and female). In these interviews, I sought to capture the shifts in these workers\u2019 attitudes towards their working lives, marriage plans and career aspirations. Additionally, in order to gain a broader grasp of migrant workers\u2019 circumstances in 2010, I carried out a factory-gate survey of workers from six garment factories. A total of 389 questionnaires were collected, with the number of respondents in proportion to each factory\u2019s size.

Jade Village is located in the northern part of Bao\u2019an, formerly a rural county and today one of the six administrative districts of Shenzhen. It is adjacent to one of the main highways running from Shenzhen to Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong Province. Jade Village\u2019s population is 56,000 people, of whom over 55,000 are migrant workers. Fewer than 1,000 are local villagers, who continue to own and control the area collectively. Jade Village\u2019s landscape in 2015 is a mixture of the old and the new, the traditional and the modern. The village entrance preserves a large traditional monumental archway, while modern shops, a small department store, hairdressers, guesthouses and restaurants line the main street. In the factory zone, a long lane leads to a huge factory compound that belongs to a Hong Kong\u2013invested garment company\u2014The Pearl Factory Company Group. The factory operates 24 hours a day in a two-work-shift system. On a normal day, the Pearl Factory\u2019s day-shift workers rush to the factory gate at 7:30 a.m. to clock on. At lunchtime, they usually buy snacks from hawkers in the lane or lunch boxes from fast-food shops bordering the lane. Some take the lunches to a nearby park to eat, often while sitting to read text messages on their mobile phones. Over 20,000 workers are employed at Pearl\u2014over one-third of Jade Village\u2019s entire population. Most of the workers come from poorer rural areas in other provinces. Although in garment factories in the 1990s young female workers between the ages of 16 and 25 were favored as employees, being considered more obedient and meticulous, factories today do not have the luxury of employing only young women. At Pearl Factory, nearly 40 per cent of the garment workforce is now male, and the average age of all workers is between 26 and 28 years old.

#Village Governance: Providing Facilities for Migrants

In 1998, Pearl Company built a 400,000-square-meter factory compound in the southwest of Jade Village. This and other smaller factories contribute tax revenue and factory ground-rent to the village government and to a shareholding property company that used to be the village\u2019s collective. Each local villager today holds a share and receives a handsome year-end dividend. The village government has used its new revenue to kick-start numerous infrastructure projects, building roads, renovating the village ancestral hall, establishing a center for the local elderly and investing 20 million yuan to build a 65,000-square-meter \u201cJade Village Cultural Park\u201d next to Pearl Factory. Because of the park\u2019s proximity to Pearl Factory, its workers have become frequent users. Gradually local villagers began to wonder whether the park had actually been built for the factory workers, rather than for their own use. Several local villagers told me that the village government had made a deal with the owner of the Pearl Factory, under which the local government provided basic recreational facilities for Pearl Factory workers, while the factory continued to invest in Jade Village.

The village government\u2019s tacit approval of migrant workers\u2019 use of village facilities signals a shift in village governance here and elsewhere in south China with regard to migrant workers. In particular, the household registration permit (hukou \u6237\u53e3) system, previously strictly enforced, has been relaxed since the early 2000s. The visibility of migrant workers in Jade Village is evidence of this. In contrast to the early 1990s when rural migrants were relatively invisible on streets or in public areas in the industrial villages in Shenzhen, today they can be seen at every corner of Jade Village. Though migrant workers no longer need to obtain work permits to stay in Shenzhen, they are still supposed to obtain temporary residence permits. Many migrant workers in Jade Village do not bother to carry these when walking along the village streets. Though a police station is located at the center of the village, only a few officers patrol, and no longer check migrant workers\u2019 permits.

In face of the overwhelming numbers of migrant workers, the local villagers, less than 2 per cent of the population, consider themselves under threat from the outsiders. Several \u201cgated communities\u201d have been built behind high concrete walls to protect the local villagers\u2019 multistory mansions. Surveillance cameras have been installed inside these gated communities. Police officers and security guards patrol the compounds 24 hours a day. Most of the police force is deployed at the gated communities, which explains the relatively low numbers of police in other public areas in Jade Village. The gated communities also explain the invisibility of local villagers. Some local villagers are shop-owners and tend their shops, but most stay inside their residential community compounds.

Yet the village government and local villagers have subtly changed their attitude towards migrant workers, although they still consider these outsiders as second-class and not entitled to any local welfare benefits. In the early 1990s, the local villagers and government could simply ignore the livelihoods of migrant workers, but in the late 2000s they have had to recognize their presence and provide them with facilities. In this sense, the migrant workers\u2019 status has been elevated, due to their huge number and the profits that they generate in the village.#Private Rental Housing

The industrial village contains a number of dilapidated, slum-like wooden and brick huts into which one or two very poor migrant families crowd, but today there are many more locally built six-to-seven-story buildings filled with very small flats rented to migrant workers who share accommodation. The ground floors usually contain locally owned grocery, snack and fast-food shops. Local villagers who own these businesses can often be seen playing poker and mahjong or idling inside their shops. Many other villagers do not bother to work, and form a rentier class. A landlord who owns a seven-story building obtains 35,000 to 42,000 yuan a month in rent.

The building in which I lived with three Pearl Factory workers is located 10 minutes\u2019 walk from the factory. The building has 20 flats on each floor. Each flat is 15 to 20 square meters large, with basic facilities\u2014a 2 meter x 2 meter double wooden bunk bed, a small kitchen and a private toilet. The flats have no water heater. In winter, workers have to use cartridge heaters, which are dangerous and leak electricity. To rent such a flat in 2010 cost 370 yuan a month (including electricity and water bills). To save money, usually three or four single workers of the same sex and often from the same kinship group or village share a flat, which costs each of them about 90 to 120 yuan a month. Married and engaged couples like to rent a flat on their own to have some privacy. As demand for flats is quite high, landlords frequently increase the rent. One of my flatmates told me, \u201cthe landlord always increases the rent just before the legal minimum wage increases. Sometimes, when the landlord hears of any wage increase in nearby factories, he increases the rent too.\u201d

Those renting tend to buy only a few pieces of furniture and some cookware from nearby secondhand shops inside the residential area.23 The secondhand items include a small television set, a wok, an electric stove, a wooden wardrobe, a small dinner table and chairs, and two or three plastic stools.

Increasing numbers of migrant workers in Jade Village today live in such private rental housing. Many factories, including Pearl Factory, also provide dormitory rooms for workers, just as in the 1990s, but only 18 per cent of Pearl Factory workers live in dormitories. According to my 2010 survey of five nearby garment factories, most of these other factories have considerably higher rates of dormitory residents. My survey found that 60 per cent of the sampled migrant workers were living in factory dormitories (N=236).^[24] Ninety per cent of the workers under 23 years of age lived in dormitories, along with 60 per cent of those aged 23\u201332 and half of those over the age of 32. A worker told me that younger workers are usually inclined to live in dormitories because they lack social networks in the area where they work; thus, they cannot share flats with friends. Once they develop these networks, some of them move out to private housing. My survey findings confirm this: on average, for workers aged 23\u201332, dormitory residents had worked at the factory for 13 months, whereas non-dormitory residents had worked there for about 19 months, that is, half-a-year more. My survey findings also reveal dramatic changes to workers\u2019 accommodation practices within dormitories. Unlike the dormitory regime in the early 1990s, when workers were required to live in a dormitory, today they can choose either to stay in a dormitory or to move to private accommodation, and management can no longer impose a rigorous dormitory regime.

The factory provides housing subsidies to workers who do not live in dormitories, not out of benevolence but for practical reasons. At a large factory like Pearl, which has a workforce of over 20,000 workers, management finds it burdensome to provide dormitories for all the workers, especially since, as the factory expanded, it ran out of available land. Workers welcome the choice of housing. Those wanting to save money from the housing subsidy share a flat with as many other workers as can feasibly fit in. My flatmates decided to save even more money by sharing a bed and sleeping in shifts. Day-shift workers slept at night, and night-shift workers slept in the same bed during the day. To crowd even more co-workers into the same small apartment, two young men sometimes squeezed into the same bed. I was counted as a day-shifter, and at night shared a bed with another day-shift flatmate. During public holidays, three of us had to share the lower deck of the bed and one of my flatmates had to sleep on the floor, because the upper deck of the bunk bed was used to store luggage and other belongings. As the bed was two square meters in size, it was possible for three men of slim-to-average build to sleep side by side; workers can thus save on rent by sacrificing living space. Though not the most normal arrangement, my experience of bed-sharing illustrates how some migrant workers strive to save money.

Though the strictly controlled dormitory regime has been abandoned, some workers prefer to live in private rental properties to avoid the rules and regulations of factory dormitories. Some factories close the dormitory gate at 11:00 p.m., and some even turn off all the dormitory room lights after 11:00 p.m. Young workers dislike these \u201ctime rules and regulations\u201d, saying these cramp their lifestyles. Couples in particular prefer to rent flats outside the factory.

#More Leisure Time

I took records of the normal workdays of one of my flatmates, Guoqiang,^[25] who sews at Pearl Factory. Each workday he would wake up at 6:30 a.m. and take 15 to 20 minutes to wash and to put on his yellow factory uniform (which he had washed the night before); he would normally depart at slightly before 7:00 a.m. For breakfast, he would usually buy two to three meat and vegetable buns from food hawkers, and walk onward to the factory, normally arriving at between 7:15 and 7:20 a.m. He would wait for 5 to 10 minutes, long enough to smoke a cigarette. The morning cigarette was a stimulant, he claimed, to help him stay awake during the morning shift.

Morning shift lasted five hours. At 12:30 p.m., the factory bell rang for lunch. Unlike many of his co-workers who chose to eat in a nearby fast-food shop or took their lunch boxes to the nearby park to eat,^[26] Guoqiang would return to our flat for a meal prepared by one of our night-shift flatmates (usually, when workers share a flat, they have an arrangement that night-shift workers prepare lunch and dinner for day-shift workers). The break being 1.5 hours long, Guoqiang would usually spend an hour having his lunch; he would then smoke his second cigarette outside the flat, and at 1:45 p.m. return to Pearl Factory to work for another 4 hours until 6:00 p.m. Sometimes he had to stay behind on the production line for another 15 to 30 minutes, but usually he would meet us in our flat by 6:30 p.m. and we would have dinner together.

Often, dinner would end before 7:00 p.m. because the flatmates on the night shift had to rush to Pearl Factory. After dinner, Guoqiang would usually spend 3 hours in one of the Internet bars in the residential area (at night, many young male and female migrant workers play online games, usually team games; a team of three or four can get together through the Internet and play war-like games against other teams). I was invited several times by Guoqiang to join his team, which included his elder brother and cousin; both lived in another town in Shenzhen, working for Apple\u2019s giant supplier, Foxconn. During the game, instant messages can be typed to teammates discussing game strategies and various daily issues; each game usually lasts one to two hours. After playing, Guoqiang would usually start his Chinese version of MSN instant messenger software to connect to relatives and friends in his home province, Hunan, and in Shenzhen. He would open his personal blog page to let friends know about his daily life: routines, love affairs, problems at work, sightseeing photos and reflections on urban life in Shenzhen. Guoqiang (and other migrant workers, especially females) would openly share private issues and thoughts regarding their work and love lives. At about 10:00 p.m., Guoqiang would leave the Internet bar and return to the flat, where he would shower for about 15 minutes and then go to bed at 10:30 p.m.

How representative is such a schedule? When I asked workers in my survey about their average daily working hours, half of them (N=198) reported that they worked for about 10 to 11 hours. This suggests that Guoqiang\u2019s daily working hours (9 to 10 hours) are shorter than the average. Compared to Zhili workers who had to work at least 12 hours in a normal day, however, most workers today have considerably more leisure time.

#Negotiating Work Time During Rush Seasons

While my flatmates normally worked nine to ten hours a day, including one to two hours of daily overtime during the non-rush season, in peak seasons their hours can be as long as those for the workers of the early 1990s. When Pearl Factory has rush orders, factory management requires workers to work seven days a week, substantially increases their daily overtime, and allows them only a one-hour break between shifts. My survey asked workers about their longest work day, and half of the respondents (N=198) reported it to be 14 or more hours. Three respondents even claimed that they had had to work more than 24 hours. This type of non-stop work violates the overtime regulations of the labor law, but workers see this as normal for rush periods.

Apart from rush order periods, my flatmates often worked a \u201crotational shift\u201d (daoban \u5012\u73ed), under which night-shift workers are required to switch and work on day shifts, and vice versa, every two weeks. Almost all workers have difficulty adjusting their biological clocks during rotational shifts. During these periods, an employee has to work 18 hours in consecutive shifts (7:30 a.m.\u201312:30 p.m.; 2:00 p.m.\u20136:00 p.m.; 7:30 p.m.\u20130:30 a.m.; 2:00 a.m.\u20136:00 a.m.). Usually, these consecutive shifts take place on Saturday mornings to Sunday mornings, and workers usually sleep the whole of Sunday to recover for work on Monday. Workers do not complain about the system, however; they accept the factory management\u2019s explanation that the rotational shift system is fair, in that every worker has half a month to rest at night.

Despite rush seasons and rotational shifts, today\u2019s migrant workers do not feel as pressured as did workers of the early 1990s. Since an increasing number live outside the dormitory and have private bathrooms, they do not need to queue up morning and night to perform their ablutions, and they all have more control over their \u201cown\u201d time\u2014their leisure time after a day of work. The migrant workers also can negotiate their holidays with factory management. For example, although the labor law stipulates one day of rest each week, it does not specify which day workers should have off. The consequence of an arbitrary day off is that workers have difficulty enjoying it with friends, fellow villagers and relatives, who may have different schedules: this is one area that is open to discussion with supervisors.

From published works on Chinese migrant workers\u2019 situations in the 1990s, we know that time and physical discipline was then common in the dormitory regime, and the reason given by factory management was that migrant workers were not up to the standard of a modern factory worker^[27] and had not yet internalized the capitalist work rhythm. By contrast, after 20 years of exposure for successive cohorts of workers, today\u2019s migrant workers are familiar with the capitalist work rhythm. Older workers have gained discipline through experience of work in factories, while young workers have been trained through rigorous schooling timetables.^[28] Factory employers thus know that workers who live outside factory compounds will show up on time, and clock on every morning.^[29]

The discipline systems inside the factories today differ from those of the early 1990s. As my survey showed, an overwhelming majority of workers (93 per cent) reported that their factories had no specific punishment system (N=367). While physical punishment often occurred in Asian-invested factories in Shenzhen in the 1990s, this had practically disappeared in the late 2000s\u2014only one out of 366 workers in my survey had ever been punished physically. Why did managements not punish workers in the late 2000s? An important reason is that workers now have a choice of which factory to work in, since there is no longer is an over-supply of migrants needing jobs. If a factory uses physical punishments, it is unable to retain enough workers; because workers now inform each other about factories through chat rooms and by a wide variety of other electronic means, an abusive employer will have difficulty recruiting enough new workers.

#The New Urban Consumer Culture and Continued Monetary Stringency

Workers in the early 1990s whose diets were controlled by factory management had to eat low-quality rice and inadequate portions of food. They could not afford to supplement this with other food. By contrast, today\u2019s migrant workers can afford to buy lunch and dinner outside the factory and can themselves determine the quality and amount of food. Vegetables today are major food items; meat is not served daily and only in smaller amounts, and rice is still the major energy source. Expenditure on cigarettes for male workers and snacks for female workers were as high as 20 per cent of their total monthly expenditure (see Table 1). Workers claim that smoking and eating snacks can keep them awake, especially during the long hours of three to four consecutive shifts. George Orwell similarly found that English miners chewed tobacco to combat thirst and to stay awake.^[30]

*Table 1.\u2003 Male migrant workers\u2019 monthly expenditure on various items in summer 2010 (excluding purchases of consumer products)*

http://puu.sh/lfbjo.jpg

In the early 1990s, the only affordable means of communication was letter-writing, but responses were slow and waiting could be frustrating. Today\u2019s young migrant workers, like Guoqiang, spend much of their leisure time on the Internet. Older workers, such as married couples in Jade Village, go to Internet bars about once or twice a week and use the web cam to communicate with their children in their home province. This is a revolutionary change in Chinese migrant workers\u2019 pattern of communication.

A higher wage enables workers to be more than just sellers of labor power; they can also be consumers. This is illustrated by workers\u2019 passion for mobile cell phones. Mobile phones are immensely important to migrant workers, and they are willing to spend a lot to buy them. A domestic-brand mobile phone costs about 700 yuan to 800 yuan (plus a monthly service fee of about 40 yuan), about 40 per cent of the workers\u2019 monthly wage. These are usually the migrant workers\u2019 most expensive asset. Newly arrived workers spend more than half of their first month\u2019s salary on a mobile phone. Several times I went out with a group of male and female migrant workers on their days off, and one of their essential stops was a mobile phone shop. They loved to stand in front of the displays and to window-shop for hours. They were knowledgeable about the models and the functions of new ones, as well as various mobile phone service subscription plans. Today, workers use information technology intensively, not only to maintain close contact with friends and relatives, but also to share labor market information. Text-messaging fellow villagers, old colleagues and friends to share vital information, such as which factories are good or bad, which have vacancies, their daily working hours, wages and so on, makes it easier to find and change jobs.^[31]

Since these young unmarried workers today are exposed to a multitude of commodities and to urban consumer culture, how much do they save? A worker\u2019s regular monthly expenditures (excluding purchases of consumer products) are only about half of his or her monthly income (see Table 1). During my fieldwork in Jade Village, my flatmates showed me their bankbooks, which revealed that they had very little savings: most had only several hundred yuan in the bank. This lack of savings has a lot to do with the foreign-funded factories\u2019 policy of retaining a worker\u2019s first month\u2019s salary as a \u201crecruitment deposit\u201d (yagongji \u538b\u5de5\u8d44). Though the practice is illegal, almost all factories retain a deposit to avoid a high staff turnover rate. This money is not given back to workers until the Lunar New Year holiday. Under this policy, newly arrived workers, who usually have very little money available before they enter the factory, have to borrow money from their relatives and fellow villagers to survive for the first two months. Additionally, in the first months a worker\u2019s monthly pay can be as low as half what others earn. When they get paid for the first time (paydays are delayed by factories and the first payment arrives in their second month of work), they usually spend almost all of it on a new mobile phone. Thus, during the first three months in the factory, workers usually run up a considerable debt; starting in the fourth month, they need another half-year to repay their debt, even if they are thrifty. The workers who lend money to them (usually relatives and fellow villagers) find it hard to save, as they are frequently lending it out. Even worse, some factories do not pay workers\u2019 wages on time, and pay less than the amount expected. In my survey, 37 per cent of workers (N=150) complained that they had wage arrears and were not certain if management would pay their wages on time; and 16 per cent (N=63) reported that management paid 100\u2013200 yuan less than they expected for a month\u2019s wages. Although other aspects of workers\u2019 material lives have improved, they still suffer from a shortage of money. As it was for workers of the 1990s, lending money can be very problematic, especially when it occurs between relatives and fellow villagers where familial-like relationships are involved.

The consequences of a tight cash situation and low savings are far-reaching. It makes workers more vulnerable if they encounter unemployment or efforts to exploit them; it also affects workers\u2019 family and career plans. They know that, once they marry and have children, mouths are not fed if they ever take time off from work. Single workers can be more flexible, but when they have a family and children they cannot but work harder to raise their children.

Many of the older migrant workers today leave their children behind in the countryside while the parents work in cities. This is a direct consequence of the difficulty in supporting an urban-based family financially. Their children do not enjoy the same public education and healthcare benefits as urbanites, and the workers have to pay dearly for schooling and hospital care. In the countryside, the children\u2019s education is subsidized by the government. When I asked several married couples who had left children behind about their expectations and hopes for their family\u2019s future, most of them said that they did not think that their lives would change a lot. They only
