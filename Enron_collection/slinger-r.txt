 Just a reminder that we really need to keep in contact with CERS on the off peak as they are beginning to buy more on more from us on-peak.  We still need to net out with them each month so any purchasing from them will greatly help us on the day shift.  thanks,  ryan 
 We sold 3mw of NP15 to "SIERRA PACIFIC HOLDING" for friday 11/09/01.  The price is 34 dollars and it is not in enpower or caps as of yet.  thanks,  ryan 
 Susan, the Real Time desk is trying to save a import schedule and we got this error. Any ideas? The deal was created in FSP, all appropriate fields are population.

 I bought 8mw of SP15 from Gas recovery systems and built the purchase in CAPS with the APX.   It is 8mw HE 9-17 @29 dollars.  We also had Arco come back up and they need to be sold or used to cover a short, it is 26 mw in SP15 and the gen schedule is already built in CAPS for 10/24 and 10/25.  They are up around the clock and need to recieve fair market price for their generation. 
 Enpower to Caps is going to be out for HE 15.  We sold 25mw to Allegheny in SP however IT has not yet built an APX5 counterparty in caps so I put it in APX1 and then changed the template to send it and balance.  thanks,  ryan 
 The fees that we charge for marketing EES has been revised and will take effect 10/4/01.  The new fees are as follows:  1-100mw's=$3 fee 100-200mw's=$4 fee over 200mw=$5 fee  Please note that if we market 101mw's for EES then we charge them $4 on the whole 101mw's for a total fee of $404.  Also if we were to market 201mw's for them then the total fee would be $1005 dollars.  In other words if they go over a the limit on one fee then we charge them the higher fee on all the mw's.  thanks,  ryan 
 AFTER TALKING TO KATE HERE I WAS MADE AWARE THAT SOME DEALS WERE ZEROED OUT IN "DEAL SCHEDULING" FOR THAT DAY.  CONSTELLATION IS CORRECT THOUGH, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 25MW AT 40 DOLLARS.  THANKS,  RYAN 
 ACCORDING TO ENPOWER THIS DEAL WAS DONE ON ENRON ONLINE, AND IT DOES HAVE 25MW AT $40 IN THE DEAL.  THE WAY IT READS OVER HERE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DISPUTE.  IF I AM READING THIS INCORRECTLY LET ME KNOW.  THANKS,  RYAN

 We had some problems scheduling ARCO as the ISO had a 10.8 mw curtailment scheduled for ARCO through HE 24 for 8/1/01.  In order to schedule the extra 6mw for 8/1/01 I had to change that outage and set the curtailment at 5mw and that is scheduled through 9/1/01.  The ISO had two separate outage schedules and I said to just go with the 5mw curtailment until you guys could get back with them on the exact outage.  Thanks,  ryan 
 It appears that there is a 10mw transmission schedule missing on peak from Pac System border to Mid C.  This has us out 320 mw at Mid C for 8/1/01.  thanks- ryan 
 Somehow it seems everyone ends up in portland...just was flipping through web pages and ran across your listing on the david douglas site.  Hope everything is going well.  ryan 
 I had to change your august schedule since I misread leaf's vacation request.  The way I have it now is four night shifts in a row from the 8th through the eleventh.  This shouldn't be too bad since you have seven nights off prior to the schedule.  I couldn't figure out any other way to do it, while keeping everyone else's requests whole.  If you would rather break up your six day then give me a call and I will make the adjustments.  thanks,  ryan
