 I verified the numbers with Ron, he did make the addition error.  I also added the line for the Red Hawk lateral as a separate item.  James had already run the economics using $843mm plus a 5% risk adjustment adder for the Capex for a total of $885mm.  I think we have enough pad in this thing to take care of the error.  kh 
 life is good, work sucks.  Things are a little tough, we judge the day by how many news trucks are parked outside.  We need a good natural disaster somewhere in the world to take the media heat off Enron.  Supposedly, the lead singer from Twisted Sister was in front of the building doing some kind of rap video.

 thanks!!!!!!!!!!!1 
 is 2pm OK? 
 When you get the pages filled in for "supply", "Plants", and "pipeline", let's review to see how we want the summary to look.

 TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station.  The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.  The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .  TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if: 1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or; 2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.   Items to Verify: 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)   Opportunities for TW: By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.  A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend. 
  Per our conversation today, when you folks get a chance, I need someone to verify the current pressure of the Gomez lateral and do a linepack calculation for me.  We are evaluating a potential sale of the lateral and need to know how much sweet gas is in the system.  Please let me know if an answer by Friday 2/22 is not possible.  thanks for the help Kevin Hyatt Director, Asset Development 713-853-5559 
 how many fingers am I holding up??    Glad to hear it went well.  Have a nice long weekend!!!!!!!!!1 
 Dennis-- Can you tell me, of the following POI's, which are active on any TW shipper contracts and who the shipper is, including contract number? Can I get this info by sometime Tuesday 2/19?  thanks, KH  POI 61206 500391 500392 9109 500241 500242

    Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted  02/15/2002 PR Newswire (Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects. 
 I found these numbers in a file, Loc Code 14039, 14225, 24008  I'm not sure what assets they are in reference to.  kh 
 Guys, is there a way you can tell me what the MMBtu content of the gas is coming into TW from NorthWest Pipeline, TransColorado, and then what it is at Gallup?  I'm looking for historical info for say the last 6 months.  thanks kh 
 the network may be in here shortly to interview me (Claire Shipman?)  Did the parents make it out of town OK?

 we will cancel these weekly meetings until we get some marketing contracts signed.  Any updates will be taken care of via weekly reports or in Steve Harris' weekly staff meeting.  By now you've probably heard that Kinder-Morgan shelved their Sonoran project.  Susan, please cancel any conf room reservation.  let me know if you have questions.  kh 
 James, can you please run 2 cases to calculate a backhaul rate to Phoenix using Sun Devil?  case 1: Using the Capex of $290,181,156 (which includes the Red Hawk lateral), what does the rate need to be using 100% load factors for 20 years with the terminal value and our hurdle return rate of 15%?  Assume fuel at 0% for the entire term (source of gas would likely be Cal border area storage facilities).  case 2: same as above but load factors as follows:  year 1-2		50% year 3-4		70 year 5-7		85 year 8-20	100%  We are trying to respond to Panda Energy by Friday 2/22.  thanks kh 
 yes the 750 case, sorry I left that out. 
 good job, thanks

 Bill, I need a confidentiality agrmt for a proposed pipe sale transaction.  We are evaluating possibly selling a lateral piece of TW pipe to Pioneer.  They are interested in purchasing approx. 35 miles of pipe that TW took out of service in 2000.  The pipe in located in Ward and Pecos County, Texas.  Once the C.A. is executed, we would let Pioneer begin due diligence covering information such as easements, maintenance records, physical location, etc.  Pioneer is an owner/operator of gas gathering & intrastate pipe transmission assets.  Their info is as follows:  Pioneer Gas Pipeline, Inc. Mr. Philip R. Allard, President 502 S. Koenigheim, Suite 3A San Angelo, Texas 76903 ph 915-655-3300 fax 915-655-3315  let me know if you need any further info.  thx Kevin Hyatt x35559 
 I saw this too.  Is this just more stumping by "concerned" politicians in a congressional election year ( I can't remember what party Brady is with).  Is it going to be a meaningful meeting or just an "open mic" bitch session.  I'd pass and read the results in the paper (media is invited) or the web site. 
 Jean, I'm trying to rebuild my PC at home.  The hard drive cratered on me.  I've installed a new one, but the only windows operating system I have is on a restore disk from Compaq (win95) and for some reason, it's giving me an "image builder" error when I try the restore.  This may be due to the fact that I trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original.  Anyway, I also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition.  When I try to load this, is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system (which I don't have except on the restore disk which won't work).  So my question is this, do we have an old Win98 operating system lying around I can borrow so I can load my win98 upgrade?  thanks, Kevin x35559

 did you see this? 
 depending on cost for 1 vs. 2 subscriptions, yes 
 selling out other criminals to bring a speedy resolution to this thing is right 
 FERC has scheduled a conference call for Wed 2/27 to discuss this topic.  I am checking with Glen Hass in Omaha to see if we can get tied into the call. 
 hey I got the printer (thank you).  Any luck on the Win95 or Win98 operating system? 
 Hey, do me a favor and only send this stuff to the house email (jhyatt@msn.com).  Hope you and the family are doing OK. Luv k 
 I'll be on it. kh 
 lunch sounds great, any day at this point is OK, just let me know.  I can come by and pick you up or meet you somewhere. kh 
 that was fast!  Received the agreement from you and am awaiting signature from my V.P. (he is out of the office till Wed. 2/27).  In the meantime, I'm having field ops start pulling maintenance files and easement records.  I'll let you know timing when I get it.  If you think of anything else you'd like to review, please let me know.  best regards, talk with you soon. kevin 
 I have a conflict on Friday, what about another day next week? 
 I would say 1 and if necessary, we could share it. kh 
 that will work.  Let's talk Monday morning and confirm that we're still on. kh 
 if it's OK with you, I'll invite Susan Wadle. 
 Economics:  Pioneer has offered $2mm for pipe that has a current book value of $533,000.  Replacement value of the pipe is roughly $26.8mm.  Potential Buyers: Sid Richardson has previously expressed an interest in the lateral.  Other area gathering companies include Duke, El Paso, and Western Gas Resources.  I've contacted Kim Watson about getting Richardson engaged.  I'll use the TW marketing Team to make contacts at the other companies.  Pioneer has executed the confidentiality agreement.  I'm in the process of assembling easement and maintenance records.  If you'd like to get together this week and go through a process analysis for this transaction, let me know when would be a good time.  kh 
 got it 
 only 2,687 mcf, this is per the field guys last week when they did the pressure check. 
 Roger, see note below.  Can you please have someone start pulling the ROW files for this pipe?  Once they're available, I'd like to review them before we open them up to Pioneer.  thanks for the help. 
 thanks Bob!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I'll also need copies of your receipts for the Treasurer.  thx. 
 I am still slated to be the panel chairperson for the Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee at the Electric Power Conference in St. Louis March 19-21, 2002.  As chairperson, my conference registration is free ($525 value), I only have to pay air/hotel/meals.  Is it still OK to attend this conference? 
 I will be there.  thanks, Kevin Hyatt Enron Transportation Services

   Attached are my notes from the open season meeting today.  Feel free to amend with your own notes (those of you who attended of course).  Call me with any questions.  kh 
 great, I will touch base Tues. 
 You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.  For instance:  Risks: Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market   Rewards: expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position) better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities) Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila   Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss. 
 you inner loop people lead such the lifestyle.  I'll take a rain check and plan on taking you to lunch later this week.  Let me know what day is good-- and we're taking your new truck!!!! 
   Jeff-- per our conversation this morning, attached is the original project open season announcement from August 2001.  A couple of current changes are:  Volume to Phoenix market - 750,000 MMBtu/d Volume to Cal Border     -  30,000 San Juan receipts		 - 780,000  Projected rate to Phoenix - $0.45/MMBtu  We are also offering 16 hour peaking capability (max daily quantity available in 16 hours, not 24) and pressure guarantees to those FT customers directly connected to the system (which doesn't help Bowie but may help you somewhere else).  Please don't hesitate to call me with any questions.  Best Regards, Kevin Hyatt Director, Asset Development 713-853-5559 
 Hi Jim-  I hope your conversation with Paul Cherry went well last week.  Paul indicated to me that you might be sending a Conf Agrmt for us to execute so you could then pass along to us some of the debt covenant waterfall language.  I'll be happy to push that agreement thru the channels here once you send it.  If you feel it might be faster for us to send you our standard form agreement, let me know.  Also, along those same confidential lines, if you can provide to me some various operating scenarios for the plant (high, low, and base case operating assumptions) I can begin designing an SFV rate for you to look at.  Let me know please.  thanks Kevin Hyatt 
 got your resume and I have forwarded it on to a contact at Duke.  Are you going to the job fair today at Enron Field?

     Subject: Why did the chicken cross the road?   A new updated version.....  -----  KINDERGARTEN TEACHER: To get to the other side.  PLATO: For the greater good.  ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross roads.  KARL MARX: It was a historical inevitability.  CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.  DR. TIMOTHY LEARY: Because that's the only trip the establishment would let it take.  SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion. We were justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.  RONALD REAGAN: I forgot.  HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.  ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was a threatening dominant market position. The chicken was faced with significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for the newly competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry Integration Model(PIM), Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge, capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework.  Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in the transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting, enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear and unified market message and aligned with the chicken's mission,vision, and core values.  This was conducive towards the creation of a total business integration solution. In summary, Andersen Consulting helped the chicken manage change to become more successful.  LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.  MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the chicken, "Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and there was much rejoicing.  FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own Eyes. How many more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?  RICHARD NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did NOT cross the road.  MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why? The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.  JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyone ever think to ask, "What the heck was this chicken doing walking around all over the place, anyway?"  SIGMUND FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.  BILL GATES: I will soon release the new Chicken Office 2002, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook.  OLIVER STONE: The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the road? "Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"  CHARLES DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally selected and evolved over time in such a way that they are now genetically endowed with the capabilities required to cross roads.  ALBERT EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.  BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.  RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road. It transcended it.  COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one.  BILL CLINTON : I did not, repeat, did not have sexual relations with the chicken. 
 sorry, I was thinking bi-directional and wrote unilateral.  The CA with Panda should be bi-lateral.

 Dear Phil, Hope you received the easement and line maps OK.  We are pulling the maintenance records together and should have this done by 3/15.  How does your calendar look for Friday 3/22 to meet at the Monahans office or early the week of 3/25.  Prior to 3/22 I will be out of the office at a power convention in St. Louis, returning Thursday 3/21.  I could then meet you at Monahans on 3/22 or sometime the following week.  let me know.

 Following up on our conversation re: Red Lake storage  assuming only a Phoenix lateral gets built off TW, no mainline or SJ expansion: Capital cost is estimated at $304mm.  A fully subscribed rate on volume of 750,000/d to get a 15% ROR would be $.152/MMBtu (with zero fuel retention).  If we assume a more gradual volume ramping up, beginning with 50% load factor in year 1 climbing to 100% in year 8, the target transport rate would need to be $.248 (closer to my "top of the head" $.30 we discussed yesterday).  Both of these scenarios assume 80/20 Debt/equity and a salvage value in year 20 of the project equal to 1/3 of the capital cost.  Also, regarding the Kern River expansion, what might the likelihood be of Mojave receiving Kern gas and backhauling to TW for delivery into Aquila Red Lake?  If the Kern volume of 700,000 (out of 900,000 capacity) doesn't go to Calif end-users, I think Mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from Cal border to the Kern interconnect.  We could then take this gas and haul it to Phoenix.  Let me know what you think kh 
 and where are you going? 
 if heat exhaust is counted in the "renewable" category, this would be another opportunity to take waste heat at TW compressor stations and convert it to electricity at above market rates.  We are looking at one of these opportunties at TW station 1.  kh 
 I'll check and let you know 
 Good luck, is it the same outfit we've been working with who handles Red Cedar's production into TW? 
 see what happens when you leave the gas bidness homey?  Williams was in some pretty dire financial straights ala Enron and debt they had with their communications group.  They apparently realized this last fall and started to panic.  Buffet boys come in and pick off one of the crown jewels at a pretty sweet price (including the KRGT expansion).  The sale not only helps WPL's current finances but eliminates the need to spend $1.2bn on the expansion.  What's interesting is the preferred shares also established in the deal.  Warren could end up owning a big chunk of WPL when it's over.  kh 
 let me know your former location number, and I'll see if I can retrieve your packet and get it taken care of.  Don't worry about the adoption, take care of yourself.  god bless kevin Hyatt

    Martha Stewart's Tips for Arkansans  GENERAL:  1. Never take a beer to a job interview 2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them. 3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church. 4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets. 5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is still considered rude to drive the U-Haul to the funeral home.   DINING OUT:  1. When decanting wine from the box, make sure that you tilt the paper cup and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine. 2.

Do not allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how good his manners are.   PERSONAL HYGIENE:  1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should done in private, using one's OWN truck keys. 2. Even if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money. 3. Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days. 4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.   DATING (Outside the Family):  1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date. 2. Be assertive, let her know you're interested: "I've been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago". 3. Establish, with her parents what time, she is expected back. Some will say 10:00 PM., others might say "Monday." If the latter is the answer, it is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.   THEATER ETIQUETTE:  1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately after the movie has ended. 2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven they can't hear you.   WEDDINGS:  1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift. 2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot. 3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance. 4. Though uncomfortable, say "yes" to socks and shoes for that special occasion.   DRIVING ETIQUETTE:  1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun is loaded and the deer is in sight. 2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires does not always have the right of way. 3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape. 4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite to ask her to bring back beer too. 
 the beach was cold & VERY windy.  Not much for scenery with those weather conditions.  It didn't warm up till we left on Tues.  Still working on the research paper.  He's going to the library today.  I think we're on draft #43. 
 The stock market crash of 1929 and its impact on the Great Depression.  He can only use one electronic source, everything else has to be textual.  All the encyclopedias are on CD rom now, including sound bytes and movie clips.  Those are very cool. 
 Dean, based on your schedule, how does Tues March 26 in the morning look for you to review the maintenance records for the Gomez lateral with Phil Allard from Pioneer?  How long do you think it will take, including a drive following the lateral route?  I would plan to fly out to Midland from Houston that Monday night, and be at the office for the meeting on Tuesday morning.  Let me know as soon as you can please.  thanks Kevin Hyatt 
 yes I did, thanks.  I'm comparing to the other quotes and will let you know next week. 
 this could be useful.  Is there a cost?  Can we get a free trial period?

 hey Richard, thanks for the invite.  I'm not sure yet, but I think Lou is trying to put something together for that weekend too.  Hope you had fun skiing.  talk to you soon. kh 
 thanks Blair, we've been following the FR debate very closely.  Last week FERC staff recommended to the full commission that the FR contrac= ts be converted to CD contracts, in effect abrogating a huge chunk of the o= riginal 1996 El Paso settlement.  The indicated shippers last year did file= a Section 5 complaint against El Paso, accusing the pipeline of over selli= ng its capacity.  This debate has been one of the biggest hindrances in get= ting shippers to commit to the Sun Devil project. 
 It was nice meeting you too!  Please feel free to email or call anytime with questions or concerns regarding Austin.  I was impressed by the Study Skills program explained last night.  If this class was made a 6th grade requirement, I think it would go a long way in better preparing the kids for when they get to your class.  Best Regards, Kevin Hyatt

 Hi everyone!!  For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.  You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.  Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.  Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.  I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.  If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.  Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair Group confirming their attendance.  Thanks for your help.  Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!! 
 the first EP one (Line No. 2000) went in service in August.  The 2nd one (line 2000 Power up) is the one they didn't get very many takers on in the open season that closed 8/2/01. kh 
 I have it penciled in for 3pm on thurs 10/25.  Wednesday afternoon looks ok too.  Friday I may be travelling.  Just let me know if you need to move it.  Susan can view everyone's calendar and locate a time that works for everyone. 
 Are you going this weekend?  I plan on going on Sunday without the boys just to see how many guys actually show up.  We saw some big ducks at Flatwoods Sunday morning.  The boys got off some shots early but didn't hit anything.  By 8:30 am, everything quit flying.  let me know, kh 
 Can I get an instruction booklet for a model 1560 (serial 1650338)?  Please send to:  Kevin Hyatt 18715 Hickory Ashe Dr Humble, TX  77346  Also, my unit keeps flashing "L" and beeping after being plugged in for only a few minutes and I can't get it to quit.  Do I need to reset the unit?  I'm assuming the "L" means Laser detected.  thanks 
 I am supposed to hook up Monday with the guys from Home Entertainment to review the requirements for the sound / projector system.  We will hopefully do a sight visit early next week. 
 that was a good one!! 
 but did he pass the drug test?  Good for him.  I hope he makes it thru boot camp. Have fun on your trip.  I was going to ask you for a ride home tomorrow but you won't be here.  I'm selling the Maxima to Cathy Corbin for her son.  Now if I can get the stock price up, I may actually be able to afford a truck.  Have you seen the new Dodge-- way cool!! 
 According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.  Let me know if you have questions. kh 
 Dear Dr. Lay--  Thank you for your presentation yesterday.  As always, you handled very well some tough questions in a very trying time for Enron.  I was literally mortified when I heard the "crack" question-- but I think you handled that well too.  As a 17-year Enron veteran, the question made me truly ashamed to be associated with the co-worker who asked the question.  Hindsight is always 20/20.  I'm sure you must know that the majority of Enron's employees don't feel the same way as this one individual.  Thanks for your continued hard work and support.  Kevin Hyatt Director, Asset Development ETS 
 Is that "instant bam" an offer or just a suggestion?  I hear a mattress comes standard with every new truck purchase. 
 click in "index history" below so see historical pricing 
 looks good kh 
 Sun Devil is going well.  We're working to get contracts closed for the shippers going to Phoenix.  I need to send you the draft precedent agreement so you can start going thru it and making any necessary modifications.  I'll get that to you shortly.  take care kh 
 News Release--  January 14, 2002  With the pending takeover of Enron's formerly prodigious trading operation by Swiss banking unit UBS, the companies will soon announce a name change from EOL to the new name of UBSOL. 
 good luck on your kickoff meeting 
 My calendar says our appt. is at 2pm.  I can do it at 8am if we need to, but would prefer 2pm.  Let me know please.

 Carrie Mr. Colin Wilkes from General Electric Power Systems has agreed to present for NGI Session C on 3/20.  He will cover two topics including "Changing gas quality specs and their impact to turbines" and "Pressure Reliability".  He is preparing his initial draft which should be available in the next two weeks.  Please forward to him a conference invitation at your earliest convenience.  Contact info is as follows:  Mr. Colin Wilkes General Electric Building 40, Room 517 1 River Road Schenectady, NY  12345 518-385-7538  colin.wilkes@ps.ge.com   Also, when you, me and Dave met at the P.O. DoubleTree, Dave mentioned an article he saw dealing with LNG gas specs and their impact to gen units.  He was going to try and get me a copy of the article and check into whether or not the author would want to present at the conference (at least that's my recollection).  Can you follow up with Dave to see if he's had any success?  thanks kh 
 Jose, Mr. Colin Wilkes from GE in Schenectady has agreed to speak on the topics below.  Thanks for your help.  We need to get together and have lunch to discuss the Sun Devil project on TW.  Talk with you soon.  Kevin Hyatt 
 Hi Stacey-- Hope everything is going well for you guys and you are staying busy (considering our current economic slide).  Have you seen Enron stock prices lately?  I've kicked myself everyday since January for not taking your job offer.

  We got one wood duck out of the Moccasin hole.  We stayed till about 9:30.  We did see 5 or 6 big ducks pass way over the top of the hole, but nothing came close.  There was a lot of shooting to the east of us throughout the morning, but I wasn't sure if it was you or someone else.  kh 
 Sun Devil: Sonoran Pipeline -  Calls to various levels of Kinder-Morgan management have elicited no response.  Sources indicate their project is still moving forward but is having "marketing issues". ROW - A large diameter water line that serves Palo Verde runs from West Phoenix to the nuclear plant.  One thought was to use the ROW to install the gas line and reach the new generation plants in the area.   However, AZ Public Service indicated that the water line is constantly being replaced due to corrosion and repair work may interfere with any other line in the same easement. Cost estimate - Current fully-loaded cost estimate (including interest, overheads, ROW, etc.) is $680mm based on a reduced scale project of 500,000 MMBtu/d capacity to Phoenix.  Various deal structures are being analyzed to present several pricing options to the market.  Likely minimum term will be 20 years based on the cost. Marketing - Duke - Met 10/25.  They have a need for 40,000 - 120,000 MMBtu/d and would likely take capacity on Sun Devil at a "competitive" rate.  Preparing rate 	offerings for their review 11/5. AZ Public Service -  Met 10/24.  They are very interested in the project and would commit today if they were given an economic out based on unfavorable 	outcome of El Paso / FERC full requirements proceeding.  Working to develop an MOU with out clause if they fund the early EIS work. Sempra - No response yet. Southwest Gas - Still interested in the project but unwilling to commit due to El Paso full requirements issue.  They are however interested in doing a JV to 	utilize their Phoenix lateral to enable the Sun Devil project to tie into the El Paso south system. Panda Energy - Meeting set in Dallas on 11/2.  Panda has the capability to be the anchor shipper for the project.  Preparing detailed supply basin study for management review. El Paso / FERC  - waiting on response from Regulatory to review recently submitted comments.  Shippers indicate some decision likely from FERC as early as Dec 2001 or as late as March 2002. Copper Eagle Gas Storage - Open season for the proposed West Phoenix storage facility began 10/15 and was to close 10/24 but was extended an additional week for market participants. 
   Attached are the notes for your meeting in Albuquerque.  Please avoid discussing the cost figures (it tends to reach competitive ears).  If anyone has any questions, or any competitive intelligence on the Sonoran project, please have them call me.  thanks kh 
 yes please. thanks 
 Hi Wayne, thanks for the reply.  It would be great if you could develop something for item 5.  I think Orlando Alvarado is having difficulty getting anyone from Williams signed up for it.  As for item 6, I may have an interested party for that one but I'll keep you posted.  thanks again, kh 
 Mike- I will need to rechedule as I will be out of town that day.  What about sometime either 11/15 or 16?  thanks Kevin Hyatt 
 that will work, I'll put it down. kh 
 that's pretty cool stuff.  When I get some money again, I'd like to build a nice layout up in our library or maybe a bigger one in the garage. 
 Kevin-- As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called "Panda Gila River L.P."  Here are some of the details as we know them: All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%) $2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge) Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale 50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market  What we want to know is: How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs) How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?  What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?  Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6. thanks for the help.  Kevin Hyatt 713-853-5559 
   thanks for the update on the Cougar.  I need to try and see him this weekend. 
 I am trying to get a customer to join us for Friday, he'll be in town Thursday and may stay over.  Let me know if you want robo-duck for tues.  kh 
 Estimated annual storage costs are $15mm if my math is correct. 
 thanks Buzz, this helps alot. kh 
 Sun Devil: Sonoran Pipeline -  Market intelligence indicated KMI personnel are canvassing the Phoenix market to solicit interest in a new lateral off the proposed Sonoran project.  El Paso Natural Gas is also supposedly contacting their CD customers to verify interest in expanding the Maricopa lateral. Marketing - Panda Energy - Meeting scheduled for 11/6 in Dallas to pitch various rate structures. AZ Public Service -  Will schedule next meeting based on Panda response to proposals.  Preparing detailed supply basin study and Phoenix supply / demand balance for management review. El Paso / FERC  - Reviewing comments recently submitted.  Shippers indicate some decision likely from FERC as early as Dec 2001 or as late as March 2002. Copper Eagle Gas Storage - Submitted non-binding bid for 100% of Copper Eagle storage capacity for 10 year term ($15mm/year). 
 Lorna, were you able to get a copy? kh 
 Couldn't another explanation be that the Board DID UNDERSTAND the partnership transactions and were comfortable with the deals once the Chinese Walls and protections were put in place?  I don't believe the Board members would shirk their responsibilities (as you pointed out, most of the members have more than the average expertise to understand the transactions) if for no other reason than not taking the chance in possibly sullying their individual reputations by not properly vetting the deals. 
 I am out of the office travelling 11/12, returning 11/13.  Let me know if you have an alternate time/day and what topic you would like to meet about. 
 The "revised" bear looks better, a little softer, more cuddly.  I'd do the revised version. kh 
 message from Doug Pedigo 
 Ben and Ron-- Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions,  Project cost $911mm Include all compression adds/mods from Doug Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01 Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San Juan, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%. Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers  In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.  Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/12?  thanks kh x35559

 FYI, I will be out of the office on Monday11/12 but will plan on working the lobby the remainder of next week.  thanks kh 
 Ron, can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the Sun Devil project at the juncture of Panda's lateral at the El Paso interconnect outside of Phoenix?  Using Doug's cost scope from 9/28/01, are we at 600# or something different?  This was the scope with the 36-inch Phoenix lateral.  thanks kh 
 Carrie, FYI 
 What would be the pressure if we don't install stations 1.5 and Kingman?  My thinking is we might not have enough market at Cal Border to require those stations. 
 Hi Harvey--  As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.  One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.  I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks for the help!   Kevin Hyatt 713-853-5559 kevin.hyatt@enron.com

  James & David -- Can the two of you coordinate a revenue model for Sun Devil that incorporates a Straight - Fixed Variable rate design along the following parameters using 15, 20 and 25 year terms:  San Juan utilization: 85% of 780,000/MMBtu/d Mainline: 85% utilization of 810,000/MMBtu/d Phoenix lateral: 75% utilization of 500,000 MMBtu/d  Also, prepare some ROE sensitivities if the above utilization falls by 10% and rises by 10%.  I will be out of town till Tues 11/13.  Can we get together that morning and review your analyses?  page me if you have questions at 888-582-7421  thanks kh 
 Hey congrats!! on the new job.  Need any more people? kh 
 Carrie, see Harvey's message below and send him the speaking invitation. thx,kh 
 I tried to call you last week but you were with a customer.  At this point I have sold my Maxima but with the current Enron environment and poor stock market, I'll continue waiting to purchase any new vehicle at this point.  It may be after the first of the year before I do anything. 
 I'll continue to stick this out for awhile, maybe ride this wave back up.  I'm working on a new pipeline project to serve Phoenix growth.  Maybe the new owners will take a greater interest in assets than the previous ones. kh 
 We will likely not have a problem until after the merger closes next year.  I think for this year we'll be fine. 
 I'm working on a replacement. kh 
 I saw Scott last year at a Rockets game.  Remember Steve Dickerson, he's working with us now on a consulting basis.

 website is Benelliusa.com  Recent pricing on two models is:  Benelli Sport (removable vent ribs) for serious competitive shooters is $1145.  This model is very similar to the Montefeltro.  Montefeltro (I shoot this one) with wood stock, 12 gauge, 26" or 28" bbl is $845.  You can also get the M1 (same as Montefeltro but with black syn stock) for same price.  Both shoot 2.75 and 3 inch shells.  Both come with 5 choke tubes.  Let me know if you have further questions. Kevin Hyatt 713-853-5559 
 I'll look at other sizes / kids in her grade and call you back. kh 
 No meeting today but here's the update.  We had our meeting with AZ Public Service on Friday 11/16.  Here's the highlights:  30 year term is not a deal killer Rates & fuel are high but San Juan gas price helps They like the pressure guarantee They like being able to swing the volume within the day  APS has electric line ROW that may include underground ROW going south towards El Paso.  If so, we may be able to use this path to reach Panda and the El Paso system at a reduced cost.  APS will check it out and get back with me.  Next steps:  meetings are being set up with Duke, Sempra, and PG&E for the week after Thanksgiving.  El Paso / FERC full requirments debate: A straw man settlement proposal was floated at FERC by one of the FR shippers.  FERC still wants the parties to negotiate a settlement but so far there has been little progress. 
 due to Conf room conflict (Ken Lay needed our room!).  We'll do it on Tues at 3:30 in 15c1.  We'll update you on the Phoenix meetings last week plus the Desert Crossing project.  let me know if you have questions. kh 
 we will have the adoption table set up Tues thru Fri this week on the 2nd floor from 11:00 to 1 in Enron Center North.  Please stop by.  thanks 
 go ahead with your plans.  The adoption table will be available on the 2nd floor of ECN on Tues - Fri this week 11:00 - 1 
 thanks BOB!! We'll take care of the shopping. 
 if the money was submitted for deposit in the Enron Kids Credit Union account prior to 11/20, then it should be matched. thanks for your support. kh 
 anything donated and submitted to the EK Credit Union account prior to 11/20 will be matched.  After 11/20 we are SOL. 
   attached is the info for JP Morgan.  Let me know if you have questions. kh 
 you are SOOOOO GOOD!! 
 Spoke with Jim Adams at Panda this p.m.  His new guy Steve Curley is now on board working transportation for Panda.  Jim and Steve will likely call us Tues pm or Wed with a short list of questions on the project.  Jim is also waiting on feedback from TECO on our proposal.  kh 
 good analysis-- maybe you should consider a new career as an ESPN sports commentator.  Who knows, it might pay pretty good.  thanks kh 
 thanks 
 i am still interested but the level of interest will depend on cost. kh 
 Price would be $1150 + tax, he has one in stock.  Ship time is usually 3-5 days. 
 Russ-- Attached for your review is the confidential proposed Term Sheet for Transwestern's Sun Devil Project.  As we discussed, it includes a 20% swing capability for Duke within a 24 hour period plus delivery capability to Cal Border.  After you've had a chance to review, please call me and we can address any questions you may have.  I look forward to hearing from you later this week.  Hope you are enjoying the snow!!!

 I am writing to you as Co-chair of the 2001 Enron Kids program.  A lot of ex-Enron folks who use your website were involved in this year's Gordon Elementary School adoption program.

 Doug-- We are working up a proposal for APS in Phoenix wherein they would share in a portion of the costs we incur to get the project's FERC application ready.  Tab 5 of the original cost book shows a cost of $8,750,301.  Is this still a good number to use for our APS proposal?  Let's talk Wed 1/23 if possible.  thanks kh x35559 
 It was nice to meet you at the Sempra dinner last week.  We got 8 ducks on Sunday morning, but lost 2.  We should've downed about 3 more.  Can you go next Wed morning 12/19? 
 Aquila informed us they are about to announce an open season in the next day or so with their partner Southwest Gas on a new storage project near Vegas.  They propose to have 12 Bcf total, 6 B in first phase.  Location is in the same salt formation as Desert Crossing.  They do not have a pipeline attached and look to be hooked into TW and El Paso's north system.  I am supposed to talk with their development person on thurs about a pipe option. 
 is this form on-line?  If so, how do I get to it.  It doesn't appear under "forms" on HRweb. thanks Kevin Hyatt x35559

   I looked over the entire list.  It amazes me what some people got, including those in my group. 
 depending on how things shake out with sun devil this week, I'd like to tentatively plan on taking this Friday 2/15 off.  Let me know if there's a problem.  thanks kh 
 I just spoke with Curt Brechtel from APS this morning.  I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.  He reviewed our offer with Tom Carlson.  Tom has 2 issues (listed by priority):  1) Enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.  Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?  2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC  APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.  APS is still comfortable committing 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sun Devil, but likely not the 200,000 we asked for (though 100,000 with an option to increase is a possibility). 
 If I can set it up, are you available for breakfast with Panda on Wed morning?  How early?  regards, kevin 
 Panda has already scheduled other meetings around ours so they can't move our time.  The will likely be in our office around 1:30pm Tues and we should be done around 3:30 -4pm if you finish with Stan early and would like to join us.  thanks kh 
 David, glad to hear you're hanging in there.  I sent your resume over to Gaye Lyn Schaffart at Northern Border.  They were looking for an analyst.  Did anyone contact you?  It's been tough with Sun Devil.  We've changed the scope somewhat and lowered the overall cost, but the current financial situation still makes it tough.  stay in touch and I'll keep my eyes and ears open for you. Kevin 
  It just keeps getting uglier and uglier around here.  How are you?  You making any money off getting former Enron folks hired out or are they being treated like lepers?  I've got a resume I'd like to send you if you're interested on a kid who was our business development analyst.  He came from EES and has a good risk management and modeling background.  Let me know if you'd like to see it.  Hope you and Daphne are doing well.  take care, Kevin Hyatt

 it just goes to show you, GOD is a first a Husker fan, then a Notre Dame fan!!!!!!! 
 a recruiter friend of mine suggested you contact leadersonline.com if you haven't already.  kh 
 I had a conversation this morning with my contact at APS re: the Sun Devil Project.  Their #1 concern right now on the project is Enron creditworthiness as it regards building this pipeline.  How do I get them comfortable? Is there a timeline for getting a credit agency rating on TW?  If so, when? Should we get Rod Hayslett / Stan on the phone with their finance people?  Please advise asap so I can put an action plan together.  Thanks for the help.  khyatt

 Dear Curt-- thanks for your phone call this morning.  In light of our conversation, I have prepared the attached document, with help from our VP of Finance Kevin Howard, in order to help APS better understand the current and projected Transwestern credit situation.  After you and Tom Carlson have had a chance to review, please feel free to contact us with any questions. 
 Geneva, see the document below for the music system bid.  Call me and let's discuss.  kh 
 it likely won't survive as Enron (due to the stigma), they'll rename it something that better fits a pipeline business restructured as some kind of master limited partnership.  Things are OK, some days are worse than others.  I'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west, but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around. 
 contact Nova Guides in Minturn, Colo 970-827-4232  have fun!!!!!!!!!!
