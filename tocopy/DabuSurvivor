My condolences to all you non-US fans who don't get thanked in the recaps.I'm even more excited! The premiere mostly focused a little bit on each contestant as an extended reminder of who they are, which got me even more excited and means that this episode might be even more of a new story.Tasha's "pray for forgiveness" being right at the start of the recap is interesting. I hope she ends up pullin' some Vecepia shit.The vote left Woo confused and Terry on the bottom? Wow, I'm shocked!Unless he finds it and Idols out Jeremy!"I want to do everything I didn't do the first time" - well you're getting confessionals, so that's a good start!Jeff is a liiiittle crazy.Abi's back!"I'll be annoying" and that PG reaction &lt;3

Holy fuck, Abi's somehow even more obnoxious this season and I love it.Kass is the Silas to Andrew's Carl.Okay this scene is fucking awesome.Dabu's Sister Update: "That's... not what I thought her plan was."Bayon is just a wealth of character development right now. I just hope Ciera/Monica/Kimmi start getting in on some of it.Okay I do like  Stephen but old-school Savage shutting down gamebot Idol paranoia is like a fucking Survivor wet dreamThis episode is *so* much better than the premiere. (Which was already really good to begin with.)What the fuck, a Terry/Abi-Maria bonding scene? This is surreal and I have goosebumps.Terry is suddenly getting a winner-y edit and I'm suddenly really on board with that idea."They turn me on" oh my *god* Jeff Varner. &lt;3333 Such a different way of bonding with her than Terry's, what a great juxtaposition.Every freaking scene this episode is character-driven. All the strategy is coming from the personalities and emotional interactions. *I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS RIGHT NOW.*Patience is a virtue.Hey, a minor Probst goof. That's always fun.  \#liaisonI thought it was kinda cute.I mean... their ASSES!:(Jeff's so fucking smug and I love it and everything else about himDabu's Sister: "Latuda? That's a dumb name for a medication."

Me: "Boneitis? That's a funny name for a horrible disease."If you're a self-proclaimed  "student of the game"  giving a confessional about your strong alliance with Shirin, you're gonna have a bad time.Abi-Maria is horrifying and AMAZINGSpencer's crying, Terry and Abi are BFFs, and Woo's being assertive. WTF is this episode? I love it!This episode was a fucking roller coaster. Hype met, exceeded, and enhanced.And to top it all off, they didn't even spend a bunch of time explaining the split vote. I really, *really* wish Shirin had gone further but my god this episode was constructed *perfectly.*"I had an awesome opening act and then killed myself" - Shirin Cobain confirmed?That's exactly where I thought it was going. I thought we'd get Kass giving a confessional about how she was pulling some Gaitherian chaos by getting him to brag about his life, but instead Kass suddenly has a soul.On the other hand, Tony.That was an awesome episode. Wow. I really love Shirin so seeing her go sucks and I'd have preferred Spencer, but it fit with the story of the episode really well. Shirin not sticking up for Abi-Maria was some awesome dark television, like a less shitty version of All-Stars or something; Jeff Varner continues to be... well, Jeff Varner, which is amazing; Abi-Maria is basically her Philippines self turned up to a new and improved level; Spencer is suddenly capable of human emotion to the point of crying; Kass has a soul; Terry suddenly skyrocketed from someone I didn't want on the season to one of my absolute *favorites*; Woo grew a backbone; we got mega old-school stuff with Savage/Stephen.

This whole episode felt so much like something out of earlier Survivor and that bodes really, *really* well. It was almost 100% character-driven, with all of the game talk and alliances deriving entirely from the contestants' personalities, emotions, and interactions. I'm kind of blown away right now. And it's only episode *two*! If we get that same kind of emotional storytelling throughout the whole season, this season could be off the charts amazing.

But in any case, this episode was absolutely fantastic and had me glued to the TV the entire time, and IMO it was a massive improvement over the already strong premiere. This season is reaaally living up to and maybe even surpassing my hype for it so far. Of course it's still early, but two victories is a hell of a lot better than two defeats. Can't wait to see what happens from here.

And three tribes is on the horizon! Fuck yeah!Yes yes *yes.* I've kind of worried that with so many recent seasons being edited around "Big Moves" and "strategy" for the sake of "strategy", maybe the players would start to emulate that and the game would become less personal, but this episode burns those concerns to the ground. God, I want it to be next Wednesday.This is especially nice to see after last week. I didn't mind his Tweets last week anyway, but this is still a much nicer attitude to read.I'm on the verge of switching to Terry or Andrew flair and that is a sentence I never ever even remotely expected to typeYeah I initially commented with a joke like "Oh man, time for the sequel to Woo Stares Blankly While People Try To Talk Strategy", but by the time I finished it I had to delete it because suddenly he was going the fuck in. This episode defied so many expectations on so many levels.I think the episode made it very clear that not everybody had such big problems with Abi-Maria. Sure, some people are just voting off threats, but Woo was just getting rid of two people that never gave him the time of day (one of whom also happened to drive a big ol' bus over him on national TV during the last finale), Terry clearly had an actual connection with Abi-Maria (*how on earth are those words actually a description of a thing that has happened on Survivor*), and Jeff jumped back to a group he apparently wanted to work with in the first place.&gt;As a longtime fan, it serves as a reminder for me that these are real, random people who really care about the game.

It's worth noting that some recruits are also fans. I've heard Cochran was a recruit, and I know for sure that Cassandra/Erinn were, and they were both really big fans. Erinn came from a whole family of Survivor fans who hadn't missed an episode since the very first one.I probably won't just because once you go white, you don't go back. But the temptation is there. It's like /r/TheButton. I know that, in time, there'll be a better option (i.e. having an even more vintage Jonclyn flair.) So I just have to remember that.

...except I pushed the button at 60s without reading the rules but stillGiving an entire jury speech about how Woo was Tony's enslaved lap dog that didn't understand anything about Survivor. Which you could argue is True on some level, but it was delivered very harshly, and in any case, from Woo's perspective, it probably didn't make it *harder* to turn Spencer down.Yeah but nobody on Bayon has gotten the chance to do anything yet. That doesn't mean we can't show any of them. The Andrew/Stephen relationship will probably play into the outcome of future episodes, so they're setting it up now.Yup. They used to explain this every episode even though it was obvious, but they didn't at all here, or in episode 3 (2? idr) of Worlds Apart. They're finally learning that we've learned. &lt;3Suddenly /r/survivor becomes a lot less skeptical about your gold flair. &lt;3From *Woo* of all people! Like, Woo "i definitely am hearing you. :| you have just said sentences. :| we are on a show called survivor. :|" Hwang suddenly busts that out and shatters the typical annoying False pre-TC doubt. Aweeeesome.I know absolutely everyone is saying Terry but I'll add to it: Terry. Really didn't like him in Panama but I straight-up loved him tonight. He was fantastic and I can really see how La Mina fell in love with him.The whole thing. Terry/Abi-Maria being a thing, any time Abi-Maria opened her mouth, Woo just exploding all the False doubt... Stellar episode. I think my absolute favorite would be Savage's confessional about Stephen, though.I loved that moment. He showed more emotion in a few seconds there than in all of Cagayan combined.Pearl Islands builds into total wonder of the sort it's probably best you know little about (even though you said you want spoilers, PI is probably an exception.) I think your opinion of it, and your understanding of how certain people could reach certain points, will go up over time.Someone said on Sucks (edit: it was Dog) that Monica is the most important player of the game because her very existence turns her tribe into Galu and I think this basically confirms itThese are so freaking good. You're making me question whether Togekiss and Audino were actually in G/S/C.Nice Target GBA![Dabu's Sister Update](http://i.imgur.com/XUUoHrp.png)You're welcome! Thanks for making and posting them!She spoke a little more humbly in her The Next Day video, and even that one's still close to when it all went down. I didn't like a lot of what she said here, but it was in the heat of the moment.Yeah all I needed to see was some fucked-up lung pictures when I was 12 and I was like "haha nope"Yeah I think Kass honestly has the best shot at this point based on the show.

...Which makes absolutely no fucking sense on any level. So whether she abruptly nukes it or else keeps it up and somehow ends up as a Survivor winner, I'm going to love wherever the hell this random CPP Kass goes next.Never thought we'd see this side of Woo. I didn't even know this *was* a side of Woo. This season is great so far.Maybe, or maybe they're on the same post-swap tribe, or maybe Stephen ends up with someone else from the alliance.I'm like 99.9% confident I won't. But I do keep finding myself somewhat tempted!I don't want to see or know about post-swap tribes until after the episode has aired.That I knew from the Next Time On, but I do avoid all other promo spoilers.Aaaah! I love these games so much. Have you been enjoying it?omgspoilerz

It blew my miiiind Lucas told me about that in Wizard Peak when I was a kid.I don't know a ton by The Police but yeah, the music in these games is *amazing.* Stewart Copeland did an amazing job capturing the exact feeling of each and every individual level. I still listen to that soundtrack on its own aaaall the time.Conservation, not object permanence. [It's fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnArvcWaH6I) to watch how [dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLj0IZFLKvg) kids are, though.I have such a powerful urge to snap them"Are you a vagina?" seems pretty sexist.Sent a Facebook message to Russell Hantz after the Samoa finale offering my condolences that the jurors were so bitter and stupid.Maaaaybe my favorite song I've ever heard. It's about the Great Flood, and it's hard to come up with a darker and more epic topic for a song than *the entire human race drowning for their sins.*If he was saying things like that throughout Cagayan, I can see where Tasha's jury vote came from. Wish we'd seen at least a little of that on the show to justify it.Against both genders, even. Men aren't allowed to have emotions, and being - gasp! - *female* is apparently the biggest insult you can level at a man. Okay, Tony.Jokes can be sexist. He didn't just make fun of Spencer for breaking down early on; by calling him a "vagina", he went right to saying that emotions like that are a feminine thing and saying that being feminine is automatically bad, which belittles both genders. The fact that he was going for humor doesn't change the fact that the direction he went was founded on the sexist idea that emotions = female = bad.

(edit: And even if you don't agree with this particular comment being sexist, I don't think that has to do with the fact that it was meant as a joke.)What confessional was that? I don't remember it.I think "dick" is a more inherently vulgar word. In and of itself, it sounds negative, so I don't think it's really a fair comparison to a totally neutral word like "vagina" where the only root of the insult is the femininity.

Incidentally, I'm not sure why it's necessary to resort to things like "Oh please", "stop", "\*sigh\*" and swears. Just being exasperated by the fact that somebody disagrees with you doesn't really add much (and, interestingly, seems to only be done by people who didn't mind the comment.)I don't get offended over "everything" and I do enjoy myself. I don't get why you have to make assumptions like that just because you disagree with me about one comment. There's nothing wrong with someone for viewing a statement like that differently from how you view it.

^^^(edited ^^b/c ^^typo)I'm not saying anything about Tony himself here, only about that comment that he made. I imagine he's a swell guy. He managed to win over a jury of his peers in a landslide, after all.I'm sure he's a good dude. I'm just interested in whether things like this are the kinds of comments that Tasha has said influenced her jury vote, and I wish we had seen more of it so her vote would make a bit more sense on the show.I assure you that I am and have been quite chill.I'm at the "DabuSurvivor having just spent like an hour on a Spyro the Dragon video and now listening to some damn good Killers songs" level of chill. I'm not sure how those two levels compare - 'd probably need to see the exchange rate between chill units and Stanley Nickels to know for sure - but I think even a cake-eating Rodney still could have his chill shattered at a moment's notice.He seems like a good sport and good dude. That's nice that he'd even say that about someone who didn't vote for him and apparently blocked him.The only thing I've heard for her vote is that she thought Tony said sexist stuff on the island. I didn't know Woo had a cross tattoo, but I guess that's not too surprising, that's pretty cool. And I would have loved to see OTT religious Tasha. Oh! It was the Brad one. Okay, right, it's mostly the delivery I remember so as soon as I saw BvW, yeah, that clicked. Thanks!I don't think telling people that they're problematic, biased, favoritist, kryptonite discussion-ruiners who do nothing but relentlessly nitpick and shamelessly shit on contestants is thoughtful.I don't really post to YouTube so I'm not farming for Likes or subscriptions here or whatever; this was just a lot more effective than Imgur to show the differences in this disc. Really, *really* love this game, so I'm happy to have this tiny little relic of its history and see how they promoted it at the time!Thanks for commenting, I also find it interesting! It's neat to have this little piece of Spyro history and see firsthand just how the game was being marketed at the time. The more I think on it and what a neat little item it is, the happier I am to have it!

Playing the game on my PlayStation I didn't notice any color difference. It's possible that there's one here just because of my emulator's settings.Yeah, I figured that's why they were out in the open - the main interesting thing here for me gameplay-wise was the Toasty portal being active despite being blocked off, and the portal sound coming from nowhere.

Interesting that you say that, though, since the two other demos I can find are more similar to each other than this one and *don't* feature these two levels! [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArTiFiAgYRs) appears to be the one I had as a kid, and it has Dark Hollow and Stone Hill. I dug out my old Underground Jampack disc and verified that it's the same as in that video (and it has some more minor differences than I thought in terms of sound effects and stuff, so that's something I should look through soon!)... but what's interesting is that that YouTuber said that they played it on a standalone disc, where mine was just a part of the Jampack compilation.

Then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd2rjvXP6h0) is another one apparently from a disc, and it's more in line with the other one I linked - title theme instead of Artisans music, different sound effect for Gnorc killing, different dragon dialogue, Stone Hill/Dark Hollow... but it's still not identical, because the Balloonist has different dialogue and there's no key chest.

So as far as I can tell, the one I picked up actually seems to be quite different from those two and the *only* one with Town Square and Sunny Flight, and the most similar to the final product with proper Artisans music, final dragon dialogue, etc.

And the video does also seem to be unique to this one! I haven't seen it elsewhere on YouTube, at least, so yeah, that was definitely neat! I'll have to look more into those other demos to see what I can find out about them, because it's interesting that there are apparently three different ones that all came on individual discs, one of which *also* came on the Jampack disc.In my experience, people who like and know a lot about ~~fonts~~ typefaces tend to really, really, *really* like and know a *lot* about ~~fonts~~ typefaces.The Es looked the most different to me. The smaller writing joins all Es with previous letters. The larger writing doesn't do that at all.He could also be a Prologue/Epilogue character. Can't be the Winds Prologue, and lol if he's the last chapter of the series, but I could see him as the Winds Epilogue or especially the Dream Prologue."Aye, and from what I saw of Joffrey, you are as unfit a mother as you are a ruler."

"Aye, and his father too I think."

Whenever Kevan starts a sentence with "Aye" you know shit's about to go down.Yup I totally agree with this. It's better safe than sorry, and all of that information will be available over the coming weeks anyway so there's nothing to lose by just waiting.I think pre-premiere and post-premiere numbers would definitely be interesting. So that puts us at 97.2% of the winner picks left with only 90% of the cast left, interesting. If post-premiere picks weren't a thing, I think Vytas would have a higher number, even with him openly spoiling that he was pre-jury. Thanks for posting all this!Samoa.

I think seasons of Survivor can most broadly be divided into 1-10, 12-18, and 19+. You could break it down further than that for each of those, but I think those are three general divisions. Guatemala could fit with the first or second group really easily and I'm not sure where to put it. It had a really old-school feel with a more character-driven story and big focus on the location, but it was also the first time we had returning/new players together, and it had some of the weird editing I first associate with seasons 13/14.Fixed. Are the two interchangeable at all, though? Since websites are called dafont or whatthefont, applications say to choose a font, etc.I don't think it could have gone badly for Aitu at all. If Aitu loses and there's no bottle, the merge is 7-3. If they lose and there's a bottle (and it has the same message it had for Raro), the merge is 7-2. Either of those are way too big to overcome. If Aitu loses, their numbers are so low they're screwed no matter what, so the only way it could affect the ultimate outcome is giving them a better chance.

And I think production would have been stupid as hell *not* to slant the game in favor of Aitu. The racial division was already controversial enough, and now somehow the relatively useless and unlikable white people they threw together were somehow running the game. It's pretty easy to tell that that would be the worst outcome imaginable for the season, while a story about the minorities being in the minority but then overcoming the odds is a much more agreeable one that people still remember to this day.These numbers should be different from 2009 onward, after Obama started taking it.That's awesome!! I'm jealous. Thanks for posting, I really love these old demos and whatnot for the first game - and just got one myself, so it's also great timing. All of those little descriptions are really fun. I wish I could see the survey just to mentally fill it out with glowing positive stuff on all categories.He openly posted on Facebook that he was back in the States and teaching his yoga classes again while the season was still filming.

Aligning with two people that would stay loyal to her until a final three where she only needed one challenge victory to win seems like a great plan to me.

But it is a really fun discovery - I found this one and the Bamboo Terrace glitch on accident when I was a kid. There are other swimming-in-air glitches in *every single Ripto's Rage level that has water* besides Autumn Plains, Seashell Shore, Evening Lake, Bamboo Terrace... probably more that I'm forgetting for the third game, but those are the on es that come to mind offhand.Did Max steal her medicine during S30To whoever asked in "Previously On, /r/survivor" why the circlejerk subreddit is so obsessed with Shirin, this is why.**SHE SAID "NOPE" INSTEAD OF "NO" JUST THINK OF ALL THE EXTRA STRAIN SHE PUT ON THE REDDIT SERVERS WITH THOSE TWO EXTRA LETTERS**

What have we seen that suggests that?lolwtf &lt;3Fantastic fantastic albumOne of my favorites off the album and some of his best storytelling. Sucks you into the world of his hometown with familiar, innocent imagery then tragically tears it down. Powerful and bittersweet ending.Hi! Welcome!

What or who are some of your favorite Survivor seasons, moments, or contestants? \^_\^Because I don't want ass prints on my new door!I think a lot of the people who defend Sandra as a player would probably also defend Natalie.She was also never brought back by producersIf the gods are just.I wouldn't describe Natalie as boring at all. That scene where she kills a rat is freaking adorable, and I think she's a really sweet narrator. They just never bothered showing her. But Sandra definitely is more entertaining. And that's a good point on the RHAP thing, I tend to not really follow winner rankings.Let me know if you ever find out anything about that Taiwan one. I've never seen that picture of the box before and that one grainy picture of the GBC is the only evidence I've seen of it even existing. It'd be great to have.coconuts :)I... what? Why?

I think the most annoying part is how it says "baby" instead of "this baby" or something. Like that baby's name is just "Baby"This is so awful on so many levels"I think after a generation or two it became partially tradition and partially consistency - there's really no good reason for Taillow to be pure Flying if Spearow wasn't.Teru-sama
We've seen religious Tasha, but she hasn't been OTT about it yet.I propose we do this if and only if you post a 5-minute video of yourself making out with a blowup doll that has Cochran's face taped on. Mods y/n?Basically that Natalie did it like we saw on the tellytubeIt was like a breath of fresh air that came too late and obviously to be even remotely worthwhile but was still a bit of a relief.At least Dee didn't unfollow Max on TwitterI mostly agree, but I think that Monica's answer would confirm whether Natalie got *Monica* to vote for Erik.It'll be Thoros'd soon enough!It's been an hour and *still* nobody's made a jab about the fact that it's Neckman saying this? /r/survivor, you disappoint me.Well he was. If he had drank more water and worked less, then Shambo wouldn't have been able to flip at the merge.&gt;But whether Natalie gets credit for that move or not is so irrelevant to Natalie's win.

Irrelevant to whether she deserved it, sure, but I think we're probably at the stage of taking "Natalie earned her win" as a given and now into wanting to give her appropriate credit for the components of that win.&gt;Finally! I feel like this season is never really discussed!

Honest question: Is this sarcastic? Cagayan does well on all polls, knockouts, and "Season to watch" threads, it's incredibly popular, and it's a very recent season with a bunch of players on the current season, including a relatively active redditor. I think it's almost certainly the *most*-discussed past season on here.

Or maybe you agree and I'm missing the obvious /s tag in which case oops ignore meNot as crazy about it as I think a lot of people here tend to be. The premiere is absolutely amazing but the Brice boot is way dreary. Episode four (maybe technically three? but w/e) redeems it because it's just a whole big setup to the hilarious punchline of Luzon losing and you get some great J'Tia content along the way. Post-swap is surprisingly good, and the merge is obviously fun, but after that it taaanks for me until the last two episodes, and even the finale I sort of have mixed emotions on. Overall, I rank it 19/28 on my own personal list. (Need to rewatch Micro and All-Stars before I can rank them, but I feel pretty confident it'll rank below Micro and above All-Stars, so likely 20/30 overall.)

I don't really enjoy Tony or Spencer like most people here do so that is probably a big part of it. And conversations that are limited to Idol counting and numbers aren't really my thing, so the episode that has 10 straight minutes of everybody looking for a Hidden Immunity Idol is really not a favorite of mine.

Still, the premiere was fucking amazing.Haha word. I thought so but wanted to be sure.Ama ama ama ama ama ameleonMy feedback is that you are amazing and thank you for existingDo you have pictures of the sealed Pokemon games? Gen III Pokemon is the shit. I really want a sealed Sapphire, but staring in dumb awe at an image of one is good too.bruhI haven't read this cut yet, but I know I disagree with it, but I still don't know whether I'd use a Stone on it just because him being rank #150 makes him line up with Mewtwo which seems pretty fittingWhoa, spoilers!

Thanks for the idea, Nick Brown.I can't wait for John Carroll to follow in the footsteps of Jeff Varner as the next cutthroat, witty, 50 y/o, old-school gay who changes his legacy as he wins over a whole new generation of fans. &lt;3I still wish Sabrina could have made it in. I can't imagine she'll be asked back again, but I hope she is.Stephen. If he's not being set up for a redemption arc, this season was not a good look for him. (Which might help dispel the whole "HvV proves JT can't think strategy without Stephen" myth and show that, if anything, they both need each other and [oh hey look I just noticed the current sidebar image](http://i.imgur.com/33Wko9C.png))One of my biggest pet peeves on the planet is how products are advertised as being "for Baby." Gaaaaah thinking about it and reading your comment is making me so irrationally angry. I agree, it's awful. If I had a baby I'd so call the nurses on that shit.If "The Ominous They" were able to manufacture entire shootings or whatever the fuck these awful pictures like to claim, they'd obviously not use the same person four times.

I don't know if he's still got any business ventures going on or is just sitting around rolling in his pile of money, but either way I feel like this young multi-millionaire entrepreneur suddenly disappearing would also draw attention, probably more than just adding another athlete.omg i want that spyro the dragon one spyro is amazing&gt;He needs to prove to Harry that Dumbledore and the Light are wrong, are so completely foolish to not embrace the mad, evil genius that is Tom Riddle.

This is a good point. If Voldemort had killed Harry personally, there'd straight-up be no way for anyone to ever oppose him ever, even on top of him telling a story about what a genius he is.

lol trevor

**NOBODY FUCKING COME FOR SIR CADOGAN THOUGH.**They also might have been thinking that hate-able characters would get cut for being bad people.I see the downvotes are rolling in. Even if people disagree with you on Riddle's complexity, this is a totally legit response to that particular point.I'm just pissed Alecto Angarita is out.That first paragraph is *such* an excellent point I can't believe I didn't think of.

And the rest of this comment is way insightful. But yeah, "Conceived via rape MAKES YOU ULTIMATE EVIL" in particular is such a glaringly obviously gross thing I can't believe I didn't ever think of that.You could argue that the egotistical, hateful histrionics are a result of literally shredding his own soul into tiny little pieces. I imagine that that'd fuck with you a bit.&gt;Are you actually asking for my score on a game to discredit my knowledge of HP in order to - in a round-about way - say that makes me ineligible to rank? lol Nope, I did pretty well on that (I don't remember exactly, but I definitely missed less than 20 characters). Just out of curiosity, what is your score on the quiz? We could go head to head if you feel that it determines one's capability of having a reasonable opinion.

That wasn't Eagle's point. Eagle's point was that, depending on your final results in that quiz, you seem to think the central antagonist has less merit than characters you couldn't remember in 20 minutes. (Which gets into your division thing and maybe you really didn't miss any who are still in so maybe the point isn't right, but I'm just saying what the point was.)The PoA movie sucked so hard. Way disappointing when the book is one of the best. (Time-Turner prevents it from being my favorite.)&gt;Is the goal to be the ranker that gets the most say in the top 5 or something?

The goal is to get Mrs. Cole, Bob Ogden, and Sir Cadogan above as many other characters as possibleOh that'd be fucking awesome.&gt;I still do not think Voldemort would have killed in a Muggle way

This is a really, really, really good point. There's no way Voldemort would slit someone's throat with a knife.

Also loved your commentary on how people dying because of loved ones just reinforces Tom's view of love.Mmk, so it's 2 a.m. and I gotta get to bed soon so I can't do a big ol' long drawn-out analytical thing, and other people have done it better than I could anyway. But I'll say that my two biggest reasons for not wanting Tom so low are:

1) Everything he brings about is fantastic. I love the dynamics that come into play after his return in OotP, HBP, and DH as he starts to infiltrate the government and take over society. The whole thing has all these parallels to the Holocaust that I think are played incredibly well and are probably the best examples of JKR trying to impart lessons onto her young readers, and you can't have any of that without Voldemort leading the charge. That may not relate to his actual personality or motivations, but it's a big, big part of what he represents and what he brings to the series.

2) I think he's really effective on a scene-by-scene basis. Lord Voldemort works pretty well as your typical Dark Lord figure with some really effective, chilling lines, and then I looove HBP where he becomes a fleshed-out person and we see that there's really nothing fundamentally separating him from other wizards. As a young kid I had the impression he was sort of this weird demonic Gastly, so eventually getting to know him as Tom Marvolo Riddle was stuff I absolutely loved and I think he killed every single backstory scene in that book - after, again, killing almost every scene before that.

I don't have as many complaints about your complaints as some other people do, but I think that, totally independent from all of this, Tom Riddle is a highly entertaining, terrifying, and captivating villain, and I think his reign of power in the back end of the series is really good stuff. Those are enough for me to want him way higher and they're sort of different than what other people are bringing up.2004 is a clear backslide, but it's also a remake of the first games, so it makes sense that he'd be laying back down again. Without that one I don't think it alternates back and forth a whole lot.

I mean, still dumb luck, but it's fun.&gt;(never homophobic slurs)

&gt;Fuck you Josh, you fucking fruit.

okThere should be a subreddit for images like this. /r/ConcertDads or something.That's fair. Still, he ticks the other boxes![The Nicaragua wheel challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmzayXR-4tw&amp;t=1m7s) and the Africa "food" challenge, submerging the contestants in cow's blood.

Or use [Last Gasp](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130325215820/survivor/images/2/2c/Last_gasp_-_palau.png) and trap the contestants in a slowly rising pool of cow's blood.[Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_(slang\))The Shrieking Shack scene was horrendous and so was whatever the hell that Knight Bus scene was. Those are the parts I remember.Sir Cadogan is the crown jewel of minor comic relief and the standard to which all OTT1 lulz characters should hold themselves.Bad for you maybe. Last week's episode was great.I know Tarzan got OTT1 in one episode of One World. Visibility and rating often correlate but they're still distinct from one another.Good spot for him. He doesn't need to outrank anyone still in, but I'm happy he outlasted lots of the other minor characters, because he does have a pretty memorable and tragic storyline, even if it's very much on the sidelines.Halloween. The feel of the autumn air. The leaves changing and crunching.Neat! How does it differ from the actual game?The screaming head on the Knight Bus was just too OTT for me. And I dunno, Shrieking Shack felt way rushed and it didn't get into nearly as much detail as the epic climactic book version.Interesting, thanks! I didn't know this was a thing.I don't think you've really watched it if you haven't.I really like "Valium Skies" off their last album.#RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY

This song is such a jam. It makes me think of my sister driving me around to look at Christmas lights.Or single and gay.I actually do kind of want to see a chameleon in a bag of Skittles now.Like others have said, making it a little more predictable when there'll be new tiles/holes would probably be helpful. I liked Time Attack mode more but might suggest making it so you get a little more time for each dot you collect.

I think the game is relaxing and all the sound is awesome as hell so if there was some kind of never-ending mode just for fun with no way to lose, I think that'd be a good addition.whoaThis is where we pray at the altar of Grant Mattos, the greatest Survivor hero of all time. We also rightfully scream to the heavens about how Shirin is either the best or worst thing to ever happen to Survivor, depending which week it is.I have never seen a comment about Grant on that page#[WIKIPEDIAN "KATANIN" IS WORSE THAN BOSTON HITLER](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grant_Mattos&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=682463520&amp;oldid=681069214)I'd really disagree with that. The show added a completely new story about her praying for Jon Snow to die, and the show's adaption of the Jaime release was utterly baffling: for literally no reason, they removed the "Bran and Rickon are dead" letter that was the *entire* catalyst for her decision in the books, and they made Robb resent her for it. They pushed her far into the background in season three, giving her *half* as many lines as Robb and less even than Shae when she's the *central* character of the Cat/Robb story in the books. They removed every interaction she had with her dying father.

And because of the medium changing, you naturally lose the narration and some of the background that makes her such a brilliant character in GRRM's work. So when you're able to get in her head and when you don't have all the additional changes D&amp;D made to her and her story, I think she is a lot more sympathetic in the books.Oh this is awesome.That seems to be the entire point of that sub. Only mod hasn't posted in years, though, so maybe I should request it and turn it into a subreddit for videos of hot things.Oh yeah I knew about those YotD ones. I was saying those ones *do* have them as a separate thing from "RR levels besides Autumn Plains."Dino Mines too, I just remembered that one, and there could be more than that. Crystal Islands.

The Mystic Marsh, Bamboo Terrace, and Crystal Islands glitches are basically the same as this one: for both of them, you have water that's roughly even with the ground, so if you go by the edge and tap square, it'll do this. For Bamboo Terrace that's at the edge of the waterfall near the exit portal (so there you're doing it over the edge, not into any land); for Mystic Marsh it's up against a tree that rises out of the water near the exit portal; for Crystal Islands you can do it in one of a couple pools of water and I've always done it near the beginning looking out at the Bentley portal.

For Summer Forest and Dino Mines, Zoe zaps you right near a pool of water (in Summer Forest it's where you learn to swim; in Dino Mines it's after the underwater section), and if you get her to zap you while you're underwater (for Dino Mines I'm pretty sure you just have to be in the water, jump, then dive down; for Summer Forest, you need to circle around the Idol Springs portal and dive into the water right at its edge in front of her) then die, you'll respawn where she was on land but with the swimming animation. Problem with Summer Forest is you normally can't die in that level - but luckily, they screwed up the clipping on one polygon in the wall surrounding the level: if you jump left out of the tower where the orb is after the water tunnel and glide out into the wall at the far left, you'll go right through and die. There are a bunch of other ways to do it in Summer Forest but this one is by far the easiest.

In Idol Springs, Sunny Beach, and Winter Tundra, you need to find a way to headbash underneath shallow water. These ones are a little more complicated but there are tons of videos of all of these glitches. And these three require you to do the double-jump glitch - if you're not familiar with that one, it's... fucking amazing: basically if you hold X then hit Square near the top of your jump (in the second game only), Spyro does one of those charge-jumps while already in the air, which increases your jump height just enough to do a bunch of cool shit.

For Evening Lake, you need to go to Fireworks Factory and go into the lava at the start. Bounce on it three times to get rid of Sparx, and *right* when you hit it the fourth time, pause the game. You'll know you did it right if the controller vibrated and the pause menu came up: if you paused too late, you'll just die, and if you paused too soon, there won't be any vibration. But if you time the pause right and then exit the level, once you hit the surface of the water, you'll still be swimming.

Seashell Shore is similar: do the same thing in Molten Crater, exit, and go into Seashell Shore, taking care that you don't go under the water surrounding its portal, because this glitch will also let you walk underwater, but you can't get back up if you go into that water around Seashell Shore. Or you could do it in Fireworks Factory/any other level with water and warp to Seashell Shore if you've unlocked the level warp.

There are videos of all of these on YouTube but that's a general overview, and some of them like Summer Forest might have multiple videos of additional methods that are also harder. But most of these are really straightforward and often really easy, especially those for Mystic Marsh, Bamboo Terrace, Summer Forest, and Dino Mines, since there's no way to lose a life by messing those up.Caramoan reunion was the first episode I intentionally skipped (and I don't think I've watched a reunion since.) Then I didn't watch episodes 1, 2, 4, or 5 of BvW at the time and didn't pay much attention to the rest, since 22-24/26 had basically turned me off and another returning  vs. new players season with Redemption Island didn't bring me back.

Other than those, the only episode I didn't watch live was the Philippines merge. Cable went out and I watched it as soon as possible the next day.

I'm from relatively close to Chicago and didn't know the Cubs were doing well (though I also have no idea what a playoff is.) So go Cubs I guess!Abi-Maria is upset for some duration of time.Underrated, probably not. I don't think I've ever seen anyone in the online fanbase who didn't love her and consider here a highlight of Cagayan; I'm sure there are probably some who will surface and prove me wrong, but it's definitely not many. But I agree that she's fun and I'd love an alternate universe where she and Tony swap positions in the boot order.I think I appreciate Tony.Considering that Probst is Probst, that doesn't seem unlikely.

Ciera should host it, though.Rule #3 overlooks us CST folks, though.

The Midwest literally carry this show on their backs, dammit!I think even the Kelley episode was pretty solid. It had all the rice stuff and a pretty surprising elimination. Not zomgamazing like episode 3 or 4 but I definitely don't remember it being boring. Episode 6 was meh but I'm fine with one meh episode in a whole pre-merge, and it was a necessary motion to go through for the story of the season.This is /r/shutupredneckman, but I do not know how you got here.I want to get off Mr. Neckman's wild ride.Paging /u/Sad_LilHATE!!!! She unfollowed Max!!!!!Oh word. Better start my Voldemort write-up.The diverse and entertaining personalities and the interactions between them. And I wanted to see those idiots on Fang pay for voting out my girl Gillian.Decent prop for the reasons /u/CanadianSalmon said but other characters did the same in better ways and I think this is exactly the right placement for her.&gt;That moment in the lake is when we really do see that Harry just likes saving people

Not the first time we see it, though, I don't think. He saves Pettigrew in PoA.I agree, this is a really nice sub. I don't recognize a lot of the games because I've basically just played the same few over and over, but it's nice to see people rediscover things they liked or get rare things they've wanted for a while, and I see that same niceness in return when I post something new I got. And it's fun when there then *is* something I'm really familiar with.I stand by every word of that.Tony Hawk's Undeground. Hell yeah.Yup. Because I hadn't signed a release, they couldn't mention me on the air and he said it was just a silly word, but absolutely named it after me.

/u/erikreichenbach xoxo luv u baeHaha, Probst just fucking with them."Shut the front door" Ciera is so adorable. &lt;3Okay Savage, to be fair, you could have been the luckiest guy alive with the unaired mutiny until you told Drake anyone who switched would go home...Monica always getting purple/pink buffs &lt;3Jeff and PG both remaining with Abi &lt;3True but I was thinking in terms of pre-merge tribes where there are multiple options.I just want Spencer gone.So he's taking the Andrew Savage repression approach.He could always end up accidentally sticking his dick in a sea urchin or something.I hope Kass flips to cause a purple rock just to fuck with everyone.Haha, wow. Kelley's fucking cold. She's starting to win me over.Prediction: Stephen flips and causes a rockMONICA CONFESSIONAL &lt;3Looks like a cooldown episode for Jeff. I like that.If that line is setting up Jeff to go home at the merge and pre-jury, I'll weep.New prediction: Abi flips, Jeff also flips to avoid another deadlocked tie.

But if he has the stones to go to stones I'll love him for it.Kohl's should call their Columbus Day sale the Kohlumbus Day sale.Saaame yo.Everyone should always go to stones every time because it is fun to watch.There have been literally 0 Stephen scenes in which he has not talked about Idols.Yes, Jeremy. It is definitely, by far on the ground.Damn yo this foliage is beautifulWhoa I just remembered Keith is on this season where the fuck is heomg this drama's so hot

great episode title...suddenly I feel better about putting Tasha as my winner pick over Jeff.whoaaaaaa that's at least three right thereWhoa now Peih-Gee and not Jeff?I honestly have no idea what's going to happen

But I hope it somehow magically turns into a purple rock because why not

And I expect some fireworks at this TCMy gut says PG goes but \u00af\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af"Second time you write my name" god bless Abi-Maria and her total lack of a filter &lt;3

Peih-Gee going out here feels weird as shit but hey at least it wasn't Jeff VarnerMy least favorite of the first three episodes, but it did have to be a little more number-counting with the swap. And the back end of it was really suspenseful and exciting.

Sad to lose Peih-Gee but I'm really happy it's not Jeff. Ideally I'd have wanted it to be Tasha but that never would have happened, so between Peih-Gee/Abi-Maria I don't really know who I'd rather have around; I guess we're starting to hit the "Everyone is likable so there are no good boot options" point.

But hey! Blindfolded funny slapstick challenge is nigh!What about a magnet?Same. She was fun there but she's just utterly fantastic here.go home automod u drunkIt's cute to watch bots try their best.Yeah I agree. Some swaps have been fun but the majority have just led to a few dull episodes. I'm interested in this one because we might get three tribes going into the merge, but that's a matter of three tribes, not of the swap. Ta Keo was already a fun enough mess.Yeah I agree that there are some on other tribes I'd be fine with losing. I'd be okay with losing Jeremy, and I'd be happy to lose Spencer or Joe or Stephen, but that individual tribe didn't really have anybody I wanted to see go.She can't spend time giving confessionals because she's still spending her time looking for a place to masturbate. It is known.Tonight, C is for Cictory.

Wait. Victory.

Fuck.TIL Spencer's dating a Baratheon.Varner has bad taste. :(I would guess that one tenth of one percent of fans thought Mike's edit was obvious at the absolute most, and they're the weirdos like us who will pretty much watch no matter what happens.Why yes she is!Abi-Maria is such a constellation.Really liked Woo last season, really liking what he's bringing to the table here. I hope he becomes an even bigger character and then wins. &lt;3If they get married, then Spencer will have even worse in-laws than most people.Yau-Man was invited back for HvV but had to decline due to work obligations.If Candice can play three times and Luara Morett can return after spending years openly saying her season was rigged, anyone can return. Don't give up hope!I wouldn't say the result of the challenge is "very minor"He will win 6 consecutive seasonsI didn't see it that way at all. Her first confessional after the swap was talking about how if anyone can survive a swap, it's her. I thought Savage would definitely go if either of them would, but as soon as game talk started it was Abi-Maria flipping, taking any possibility of a Savage/Tasha boot out of the equation.&gt;Monica passed Natalie &amp; Mick

Now I just can't wait for her to pass Russell H.She got fine air time in the premiere and like half her tribe weren't shown last time so yeah I didn't read into that. That's True that Savage is stronger game-wise; I just didn't feel great after his confesh about being screwed by twists.The first 9 minutes gave confessionals to the earliest and most recent contestants.Played after Mike Skupin's shocking, emotional departure from the Outback in the all-time best Survivor episode back in 2001.*HvV2 after her edit skyrockets and she becomes the heroic winner of this season, obviously.Shutupredn3ckmanYes she did. It was basically just a breakdown of the numbers on her tribe, but she got a confessional this week.You could just as easily say that it's hard to care Woo was blown away by the vote when he impressively stood her ground. The two are unrelated. Even if his read of the dynamics wasn't impressive, seeing him be more open and forward sill is.Whoa, the AV Club does Survivor reviews? I am surprised I didn't know that.

edit: Scrolling through a lot of the ratings, I'm okay with not knowing it. And the reviewer... hasn't even seen Pearl Islands, so. I will stick to not reading those.More Tony Hawk's Underground. This version of this song is what got me into them. My 8-year-old self was convinced it was the single greatest thing in the history of music, and it's still pretty damn good.AthjahakarSoundtracks to those games were amazing. Eliran Ben-Ishai, aka "DNA-Groove", has some awesome shit. I recommend him so strongly.I didn't expect Varner to be so... not necessarily unhinged, but the hinges are pretty loose, at least, and it's amazing.How about if Stephen starts thinking about the fact that people try to credit him for JT's win and gets so emotional about the Falseness of it that he breaks down and quits?How what?

/r/DabuSurvivor, /r/shutupredneckman - you'd better dive on /r/moostronus before it's too late.I'm with you on this. I went on one roller coaster once ever. It was apparently a relatively easy one that isn't bad at all so it should have been an easy introduction, and NOPE. Kept my eyes shut the entire time and tried to pretend I was somewhere else and never even remotely considered ever going on another one again.I don't think there's that big a difference since season 27.All gewd. Which seasons have you seen?

I don't think PG has a great shot but I wouldn't count her out with some other people we've seen back.Airport, Canada, Moscow... New Jersey and Manhattan. Those are the first five that come to mind but I'm already thinking of some awesome ones I'm leaving out so I'll just leave it at that. Airport's definitely my favorite, though.THUG is awesome.Eh. I'd rather have a few more minutes getting to know the contestants.\#keephopealiveHeavily edited so you should keep in mind that what you see might not totally be what happened (like when they turned Jerri into the worst person on the planet in season two), but not scripted.

lolOkay, NeckmanSpyro is fantasticNope. My opinions of SJDS is already pretty high, and in any case, the content of those episodes doesn't change just because of future appearances, like how Parvati doesn't become a bigger character in Cook Islands just because she was one later.

I also don't think SJDS's position after Cagayan was "unfortunate" at all. Maybe in terms of fan reception, but I thought it was a massive step up on basically every level.I don't even get who "didn't know what they were doing" to begin with. Keith and Drew are the only ones I can think of, but they were two of the most popular ones on the season.Cirie catching a fish.&gt;The username of the original author has been hidden for their own privacy.

lolThis is a fucking awesome write-up and has me excited for eventual longer discussions of these major characters. For all the talk of some of the earliest write-ups being short and uninteresting, I prefer to think of it as a slow burn to awesome posts like this later on.Okay but seriously wtf was up with that hug.Pretty freaking great one./u/owlpostagainWinner or merge boot.Phillip's body doesn't have to do with why he's awful, though. A jab like that is pretty lame and immature, since it's also insulting anyone who might look like Phillip without being horrible (not to mention being weak from a "humor" standpoint, since it's an easy and lazy insult with so many other unique Phillip traits begging to be mocked.)Free connection.

This was the first Queen song I really liked. I've had it stuck in my head today so this is good timing.

Gets more awesome than I typically remember at around 1:49. Freddie Mercury is fucking amazing.I'm just gonna pick up from here without even trying to figure out what I missed I guess.This is a really good write-up and great reason for the cut. I didn't think you'd be so positive for her. I'd have her even higher but it's hard to complain about a cut for that reason with that post.My write-ups in the first one were all amazing, though, right?Anyone who doesn't love Hali is objectively a bad person.I like to think you mean out of the entire cast. SJDS &lt;3I heard that! But I didn't check it all out in detail. I figured I'd just pick up where things are now.

I'm surprised all the refreshes are gone. No way mine would be gone before top 30 or so.I think I remember you mentioning how you'd cut her earlier than most people and Shirin conversations tend to get weirdly polarized so I expected something more negative I guess. But either way I'm happy with what we got!Wait, fuck, again? Seriously? lolJaison in episode three is the single greatest single-episode character in the entire history of Survivor. &lt;333 My god it's so fucking beautiful and surreal every time, no matter how much I've seen it. The Born To Run of Tribal Councils.

Necky would love you for calling her upwards failure.I love Gabon and I love Crystal but I need to rewatch to iron down just how much I love her. So many back-to-back exits. lol @ Hali Ford being so controversial.Margaret is awesome.I like Helen a lot but honestly this is a chill place for her. She doesn't get as much focus as she could because Brian/Ted got such big edits. Brian sucks.

Whoa whoa whoa, Jonathan 2.0 is still in over some of these folks? Yeah, happy he's nominated then.Why hypocritical?For me, I'd put her with other decent early boots. She was pretty fun in the first two episodes (I didn't care about her on the first viewings, but on the rewatch her reaction shots are amazing) and I was a little upset to see her go but she didn't have any real story. She was fun though.Ha. Well played.Y'all be bananas up in here.My main goal with them at that point would be to exert more power over those I don't want in the endgame. I'd use them to try and force out the Chris Daughertys.Mike needing an Idol to stick around is fittingOkay I'm actually like really okay with this looking at who went up. I'd have Rodger higher but I can see where he might not seem to deserve it as much, I'd definitely have Elisabeth/Ethan much lower than this point, Helen/Mike I'd want around longer but I'm not way invested in it. Christa/Jonathan 2.0 getting saved is a little iffy for me but if it saves Sleckman and Shirin, both of whom I'd rank above both Helen and Mike, definitely worth it.

GJ &lt;3I guess I'm just an awful person who would probably use it more offensively than defensively. Maybe I'd have ended up using it sooner depending on the pool, though, since which favorites might get nominated is kind of harder to predict in a hypothetical.I'd go Shirin &gt; PG &gt; Vytas personally.

Which is exactly how I'd rank their first incarnations, too. Hmm. I wonder who the first person out will be that'll change that. Probably Abi-Maria or Stephen.People I think are overdue after checking this for the first time in a while: Lex, Kelly, Rob C, Heidi, Christa, Bobby Jon, Steph 2.0, Todd, Luara, Tony. Luara in particular is really, *really* surprising to me. I'd post longer stuff but my sister is arriving home soon and we are going to go get dinner, so I'll whine more later.If Rodger Bingham is corn, then I'm Mormont's raven. &lt;3I'm now okay with him being nominated just because I got to say that sentence.Who?True, but a lot of those come from two specific episodes. 30% of all her confessionals come from episode two and the F6 episode, where she got big edits. It's really the mid-season where I remember her dropping off, which looks pretty supported by the confessional counts. And even aside from numbers I just felt she wasn't consistently big in the story throughout a lot of the season the last time I watched.JSYK you have to do two line breaks to get a list instead of, well, that.

I won't worry about all the individual cuts because it'd be overwhelming (Gabe and Jynn being out &lt;///3 though.) The Amazon argument sounds interesting, though, where's that at? And the Richard thing? I'm surprised Malcolm would stir up much conversation.The first song I really loved by them that made me interested in getting more by them. I'm amazed that this one, Jump On My Shoulders, and especially People weren't singles. Sail ain't got shit on these.I just re-read it and no yeah I totally agree with it still. I might try Africa again but I was specifically trying to care about him the last time I watched and there was just nothing there for me.Oh, FUCK. Judd. I didn't even realize he was in. Gross.Or maybe I dislike him in part because I sometimes got tired of seeing him over others (though I care more about that with Ted.)Pretty sure, yeah.Remind me to read this when I rewatch.no uTop 40 amazing probably, but I'd definitely not have him in a top 15.Yeah, I know what you mean about the continuous heartbreak. I love all of these contestants as if they were my spouse, so losing so many already? It feels almost like I've been divorced three times.Holy fuck that was even better. I've never watched them before but this was absolutely amazing, especially after OP's video.Other contestants I liked more than him had been cut earlier than that, leaving me with more I still liked less than him at around 141. I was right about to cut him when you did. I would have done Heidi/Deena/Rob C. back to back, but you stole that from me.You're cool now!Gee, you're welcome!For me it's mostly Pokemon merchandise

Like lots and lots of Pokemon merchandiseBuy artsy Pokemon pictures.I could see Spencer as a pre-FTC fan favorite "golden boy"... again.Higher for sure.Same but probably for different reasons.Then attack the attempted enforcement, don't attack religion itself or religious people, because then you're also being a dick to all the ones who don't care what you believe and being literally exactly what you hate.&lt;3 Have donated and shared it with others, and I really hope people on here do as well. Even if people just share it, that'll help it reach more people who might be able to donate more, and even small donations are really important and add up! If even half the people who look at this page in a day were to donate $1 each, that'd far exceed the amount donated by any one person, and that figure would only get bigger if some of those people share it with others.&gt;Jon Arryn doesn't stop her

[ASOS](/s "He *was* about to until she murdered him, to be fair. He was going to have Robert fostered with Stannis.")[AFFC](/s "I hope he gets killed by an Other. After hearing all the vile shit he did to try and turn Samwell into a warrior, it'd be pretty fun if he loses the battle that the Slayer won.")The High Septon is almost always described as rainbow and I don't think most readers assume he's gay.&gt;The Undying were all around her, blue and cold, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their dry cold hands, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. Even her heart had ceased to beat. She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting...

Also the rest of that fucking chapter wtf.None. Sandor, Aegon, Robert Strong, LSH, Dondarrion, and Lord Snow are enough. (And I guess you could put JonCon in there, too, but I can't imagine anyone was invested in the story of Jon Connington drinking himself to death before Dance came out.)Now I wonder what those reeeeasons are.&gt;A thousand years before the Conquest, a promise was made, and oaths were sworn in the Wolf\u2019s Den before the old gods and the new. When we were sore beset and friendless, hounded from our homes and in peril of our lives, the wolves took us in and nourished us and protected us against our enemies. The city is built upon the land they gave us. In return we swore that we should always be their men. *Stark* men!

I got goosebumps just re-reading those few sentences. The North fucking remembers.SJDS for sure. Natalie winning was pretty clear and I was totally happy with it while also diehard rooting for Jaclyn and loving Missy. Also really love the Vanuatu and Pearl Islands F2s but their jury votes kind of have to go the ways they did for the seasons to make any sense.Hell, even I didn't realize he did it.I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? ICE COLD!It'd be pretty hilarious if her low-key but positive edit is building up to her going out right before FTC again, but this time as a major threat.Illyrio Mopatis. Dude is loaded and involved with some awesome schemes... although losing the love of his life the way he did is awful. So maybe Bronn.

Or Rhaego to get the hell out of this universe before things inevitably go to shit for me.I just prayed to the Lord up above that Woo make the finale. I don't really know how God deals with these types of things but I'm pretty sure that that means I've at least cancelled you out.Wild SILAS appeared!I would say that that is a feminist response... just that that's not the awful thing sfielbug (unsurprisingly) seems to think it is.I'm not surprised she doesn't have more, but I am surprised she ranked as high as 8/20.Oh yeah absolutely. One of my favorite chapters, especially out of Clash. Weird ain't necessarily bad, and that was definitely something that gave me the "WTF" reaction.People say Darkstar was supposed to be fan-service or some kind of Oberyn 2.0 or something, but I've never actually seen the source where GRRM allegedly said that.I just say "they" and never assume gender by default.I've never thought of it as "sword" thrusts and don't think that's the implication at all. Hope not at least.I don't really see it that way. I think she sees giving him sons as romantic and she's pleased to think about it.&gt;all of Cersei's scenes are demented, IIRC.

True but that's also the context. It's fucked-up sex in the first place so there's a reason they're being written in fucked-up ways. And Cersei herself isn't the most stable, and hasn't had the most stable sexual history. So it makes sense that her scenes in particular would be like that.Still, saying he "*is* a pedophile" is a really big difference. They say "girls" without it referring to children all the time. "Boys" isn't really different. Saying GRRM handled homosexuality poorly because you personally don't give Corbrary the benefit of the doubt due to his generally being a bad person really isn't fair.Good cut and nomination. Cambodia Abi is fucking amazing so far though.Rotu, Drake, Koror, Casaya, Maraamu.Not a fan of onions? Casual. You watched Gabon so wrong.Great cut, probably overdue, also a good nomination. And people say this pool sucks pfft.OP may have been saying he was waiting for it up until that.Great write-up for a great character I still can't believe is back and so amazing on this new season. Also totally fine with this nomination.Redemption Island. Maybe Worlds Apart since I wasn't really rooting for Mike so much as against the rest of the F7.Oh that's beautiful.Cersei. Eddard XII:

&gt;The queen stood. "And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?" she asked softly. Her eyes searched his face. "You should have taken the realm for yourself. It was there for the taking. Jaime told me how you found him on the Iron Throne the day King's Landing fell, and made him yield it up. That was your moment. All you needed to do was climb those steps, and sit. Such a sad mistake."
&gt;
&gt;"I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine," Ned said, "but that was not one of them."Too many people would get pissed off if the recruit tribe won for production to risk it (though I'd be rooting for them pretty hard.)Thirded.I think this is a common thing. Library on my college campus has this now, as did my high school library and I think middle school before that.I don't really know the first thing about competitive Smash but this is such a cool idea that it kind of single-handedly makes me want to learn more about it.Jaison seems pretty cool.Colton, Russell H., and Phillip would probably disagree.After a bit of Googling, it appears there is! Google SCUS-94439.Yup that's exactly it for me. It's that it's *Voldemort* doing it.

But I also have not seen that movie so I actually wonder, like, wtf was up with it, what is the context and why would he have possibly done it to begin with. It's jarring to see .gifs of it but I haven't found the actual scene because when I've tried to Google it I mostly just find .gifs.Yeah that's True. Fine by me since I'm not especially interested in the movies anyway. In any case, what was the context for that? Does it at all make sense from a Voldy character perspective?literally came here to say this \#llama(Unjerk: I've tried to live tweet but they never show mine. :( All I want out of life is for a Twitter account with "Silas Screws" in the name to show up in an actual Survivor episode; is that too much to ask??)People went back and forth on this one but I gave her OTTNN for the addition of her and Spencer having confessionals about her being straight-up mentally unstable.I haven't rewatched Caramoan and didn't Edgic it, but I know at the time I felt MORPP was more appropriate for her.Yup okay definitely weird as fuck thenEven if I wanted my son to take a different path - which I personally wouldn't and fuck you for assuming *nobody* else could be understanding of their kids' differences just because you would be too closed-minded to, but I'll grant that in this specific society with Randyll's background and values I probably would - that's still no reason to *fucking abuse him.*

Being a maester was the best option for Sam. It plays to his strengths and lets him do some good while removing him from House Tarly as completely as anything can; even at the Night's Watch, his name is still Tarly, but as a maester he wouldn't even have a surname. It makes Dickon the heir like Randyll wanted at 0 cost to anyone and even in a vacuum it's clearly the ideal life and occupation for Sam.

Randyll abused him for days for even mentioning it.

If you think disagreeing with that is bullshit, I pray you never have children.Yeah that's a fucking horrible moment that dropped my jaw. Randyll is revolting garbage who will burn in the deepest of the seven hells; I just hope we get to see him die pissing his pants and screaming first.The Survivor thread in the Entertainment board is a solid place.People always say Darkstar was supposed to be an Oberyn 2.0 fan favorite, but I've never found the GRRM quote on that. Not saying he *didn't* say it but I've looked a fair amount and never found anything but people referencing it. Would love if someone could track down where he actually said it or if it could be proved b.s.American here. I hated it when I was like 12, but now (20) I think it's without question the best part of the movie other than maybe the moose jokes in the credits. It's so amazingly stupid. I want to show my sister that movie in the near future just because I think she'll hate that ending.I think I remember reading on Cracked that that wasn't supposed to be the ending but then it got cancelled before the next season or something.&gt;*They died building the railroads, worked to bones and skin*
&gt;
&gt;*They died in the fields and factories, names scattered in the wind*
&gt;
&gt;*They died to get here a hundred years ago, they're still dyin' now*
&gt;
&gt;*The hands that built the country we're always trying to keep down*I'd tell him to be the prettiest damn princess out there and ride the cutest pony he could find. What's wrong with princesses and ponies?LSH/Jaime/Brienne has me all kinds of anxious but I'm most excited for Samwell, Sansa, Jon, Daenerys, and Aeron.

...Fucking everyone. TWOW is gonna be great.That one I've seen. It's similar to what people throw around but still very different from this image of a totally out of whack GRRM actively trying to write some sexy Oberyn 2: Electric Boogaloo.Oh damn okay. I thought it was about Bloodraven not being able to un-cripple Bran but okay, "chains" has me sold on it being a Luwin thing.Whoa. Yeah that's oddly specific to put back to back in a Jon chapter, there's no reason for him to think of those two particular locations back to back. Niiiice catch especially since that's a big hint for Lyanna/Rhaegar being married.Yeah, you can't just keep repeating the same twenty good jokes over and over or they lose all humor.He didn't really control any votes in Australia. Debb and Kimmi were easy unanimous votes, and he got votes when both of them went home. Rodger/Elisabeth/Mike were a solid trio so I don't see him ever winning on that team. His playing style wasn't really suited to Australia - but it's much more suited to season 31, as we're seeing now.Yeah I think he was as popular as any 2001 merge boot could be (even though Africa's 2001 merge boot is better!!!!) even before this season. I don't think OP is totally on the mark there.Oh my gosh, nice! Those are way cool. I want that egg thief one in particular.Took a couple tries to master but it's surprisingly not that hard to get Jed by just veering left. Of course, the actual path also isn't hard (the hard part is just figuring it out) and is probably easier than this, but still, it was neat to figure out that you really can just do this. I dunno if this has been figured out already but I don't see any videos of it.

You can also do [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDgb1ll4WOw), which is maybe a little easier than simply veering left but also harder than just doing what you're supposed to. That one I figured out through spyrohints.com; the original linked one I wondered about, expected to be impossible, but eventually nailed which felt pretty fulfilling with how many times I tried as a kid.Don't forget Survivor! (Yes, it's still on!)Every video I found of players reaching Jed involved the intended path that uses multiple supercharges, except for one where they did a 270 to land on the last little wooden ramp. This is probably a pretty common thing to attempt - when I was like six I figured this is how you got him and then gave up and decided the stupid level was impossible - but I haven't seen it actually done. I'd be interested in why you think a lot of people know about it.Minor thing: Chet had a bad foot infection and only asked to be voted out because his options were that or a medevac and he wanted to at least get a TC torch smuff.

Still love the hypothetical, though.I think it'd need to be one of those last two. Dave, Alex, Heidi, and Christy on the jury doesn't look great for Rob over Jenna. Not sure whether Matt or Deena would have gone for him either.We could have seen more of [her amazing friendship with Leslie &lt;3](http://leslienease.blogspot.com/2011/03/courtney.html)Season twenty-two has no returning players. Rob/Phillip are an unbelievably awful pair to have dominate a season's air time and Hantz on three of four seasons was ridiculous.

Or maybe remove all the god-awful reactions to Sue's quit because fuck that.&gt;he didn't allow yau-man to win

In a game? How dare he!

Yau-Man made a deal and it backfired, same as tons of other players.., only his deal involved exploiting Dreamz's socioeconomic status. One of the coldest, cruelest moves we've ever seen on Survivor.Self-proclaimed, probably none besides Brian.I don't think it's "obvious" that it's a top five season at all. Some of those post-merge episodes are really unnecessarily lame, and the Tyler Perry Idol was brutal. I mean I can get putting it in a top five, but I don't think that's necessarily "obvious." I rank it around #19.I've never really loved Cagayan as much as most people do past the pre-swap, but for a while every single time it came up on here people unilaterally adored it - which is fine since people have different opinions, but I've been seeing a *lot* more comments like this even over the past couple days, and it's nice to know that I'm not alone on here.Because clearly not liking Spencer as much as the rest of /r/survivor does means you're detracting from the conversation.Kass/Woo FTC. I don't even really care how it goes after that. Kass wins, holylol. Woo wins, we probably get to see a lot more of him and probably less of Tony. That'd take away a bunch of my problems with the season and give me an outcome I like a lot more at the end, too.Colton would have received roughly -472 votes.Ah, gotcha. I have not seen it in them but I also don't really watch speedruns. Oh well. It was new and exciting to me and clearly to some others here.Russell Hantz, Phillip Sheppard, Colton Cumbie. Hantz was and remains my least favorite thing to happen to the franchise, Phillip was the worst thing to ever happen to one specific season, and Colton... Colton. There are other contestants I dislike quite a bit but that bottom three is so easy for me.His dance after Sue quits was classless. I think it's worth checking them all out eventually if watching every season appeals to you, but skipping 22 and 26 in particular really wouldn't be a big loss.

Soon you're coming up on a lot of seasons that have returning players, though. 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 27 all had players from previous seasons that you haven't seen, so after SJDS and Cagayan it might be better to go forward from when you stopped watching (which sounds like it'd be season nine, Vanuatu, a pretty freaking excellent season.)Yeah but that's happened with a bunch of other contestants since then. With KShinn it's at least a running joke sometimes.I think both 29 and 28 are absolutely worth watching. Cagayan has four returning players on this season but SJDS has three, so it's not really a big difference, and I think SJDS is miles better. Cagayan is more popular here but both have diehard fans and are absolutely worth watching.Before Caramoan I remember most people thinking Allie/Hope/Laura were all identical, but I felt confident Laura would outshine the others and be a high point of the season (although with her early departure she turned out to only be a high point because everything else sucked so hard.) Also called Jonclyn as the stars of SJDS. It's almost enough to halfway make up for thinking Phillip would be the most popular winner in Survivor history.Yup. Basically the worst thing to ever happen on Survivor ever.You're welcomeSee my other reply. I didn't know that, but oh well. It was new to me and clearly to some others as well.Whoa. That's fucking awesome.#ARAS, NOOOOOO!!!!!Aah gotcha. That's still very different, though. The impression I had was of GRRM thinking "They liked Oberyn? I'll just write a new Oberyn!" which is so un-GRRM-y and still not in line with those quotes. So that's definitely different. Thanks.I wear them.There are very, very, very many more than 20 Pokemon that only evolve by leveling up.Yup. I have a level 100 Psyduck, ~~Pikachu,~~ and Charmander, and none of them will evolve now....lol oops.

Still, I'm not evolving her. &lt;3He hasn't "bullied" Stephen in literally any capacity.On the other hand, comments like this just make me love Savage even more.

We fuel each other, you and I. &lt;3&gt;even though Survivor is "only" a game, this game doesn't preclude emotions and personal attachments

How can you say this right after saying that Dawn was unlikable and insufferable because of *her* emotional response to playing Survivor with people she cared about?

Also, she had a mental breakdown when her teeth fell out because she lost them when she was traumatically mugged by a student, and being by herself without her teeth gave her a flashback to that. Really hard to fault her for that.Why?Ometepe, Bikal, Ometepe.I think I have three copies of Tony Hawk's Underground. Otherwise it'd be a tie at two copies between that, a bunch of Pokemon games, and one more game.Believing that is fine, being a stupid dicknose about it like whoever created this picture isn'tHE POISONED STEPHEN'S WATER SUPPLY, BURNED HIS CROPS, AND DELIVERED A PLAGUE UNTO STEPHEN'S HOUSE!Drew ChristyNice! I tried to get this one going a few months back but nothing came of it so I'm really happy to see it come to fruition.

Well played on "ninja stealth edit".&gt;He's a character that extracts emotion from you whether you like him or not.

If those emotions are negative, then people will hate him.

I don't think literally anything Phillip ever did was even remotely entertaining for a second, and I don't think it's really impressive to improve on a second try when he was literally trying to lose his first season.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorRankdown/comments/2cuxe9/round_02_494_contestants_remaining/cjjav5n) is a long post I did like a year ago on why I hate Phillip.Borneo, Gabon, Nicaragua. Maybe Pearl Islands, there are some duds in there but the good ones are *so* good that it balances it out. Sandra, JFP, Rupert, and Lill all on the same season is insanity and basically an all-star season, then you also get Burton and Savage and even fun supporting characters like Ryan S., Osten, Christa, Shawn, and Trish. That cast isn't as solid all-around as Borneo or Gabon but its highs are so high that it makes up for it.

Borneo's cast is the best, though. That shit's the Born To Run of Survivor casting. Every single casting choice was A+ with maybe, like, one or two A-'s at the absolute worst, no filler.Some of them could be up in the air but defffffinitely Sansa VII for ASOS/the series in general. AGOT probably Visery's death, Clash almost certainly HotU, Feast probably Cersei's arrest, Dance I'm not sure between for the watch or Davos IV or the Epilogue.And now your watch begins.Alex Bell married Kim Powers, and Richard married a guy he met on the pre-jury vacation in All-Stars.When Kourtney was undergoing some medical stuff for her medevac injury, they also found out that she had cancer. Wonder whether they'd have found it early enough to treat it if she hadn't been in a hospital for the injury.

Jimmy Johnson also was in really bad shape physically when he first applied but completely changed that so he could get on Nicaragua and said the difference in his health between his first application and Nicaragua is so great that Survivor basically saved his life.You're welcome! I think Richard is especially unknown, and Alex/Kim were relatively small characters from different seasons, so they're not the easiest to recall.He had a son before Borneo who appeared in his audition tape. Not sure whether he had any after Survivor.Not small, but *relatively* small. Most people don't really think of either of them when they think of the season. I think Jenna, Matt, Rob, Heidi, Deena, Christy are all definitely bigger in Amazon and probably the entire merge tribe (other than maybe Kelly? but other people seem to remember her a lot more than I do) as well as Silas/Lindsey in Africa.Immensely. If it's someone producers like, they have literally no reason to not do it, and in any case they surely do it on accident because of course more cameramen will be filming the area where the Idol actually is.I don't see that at all. It looks to me like Stephen just didn't fit in. In any case, the very nature of Survivor is that you have to get someone besides yourself to be on the outside, since someone's formally deemed the outsider every round and you don't want it to be you, so *if* he was doing that, that's just the game. I mean, Stephen also talked pre-game about wanting to get Savage out as early as possible. Savage is just the one who seemed to be doing better at it.Skupin 2.0 is good, but Skupin 1.0 is amazing. The entire pig saga is weird as fuck and hilarious.Way to break the streak of "X the Y".EDGIC:

Jimmy - MORP

Cindy - MOR

Sheen - OTTM

Libby - MOR

Carl - OTTP

Bolbi - OTTN

Goddard - UTR

Weird Alien Host - OTTNN

Also I forgot how cute Goddard is. &lt;33They're all too busy targeting each other to notice or care. They'll all want him out at the end, but then he'll win the last two challenges and take home a unanimous victory over Jimmy, even after voting out the ideal goat (Sheen) in third. It's Tocantins all over again.Sheen's OTTN persona will annoy the casuals enough that they won't vote for him to return. This whole thing feels very familiar, right down to the name...He was one of the most entertaining ones that season for sure, but I think his exit was well-timed and he could have been less interesting had he stuck around, and in any case his medevac is one of the best moments ever. Plus if he sticks around who knows whether Ogakor wins and Colby/Jerri become such household names. So I'm good with it.All I have left now is half of Gnorc Cove, the last chest in Gnorc Gnexus, and then Gnasty's Loot!Oh shit. I dig it. Nice.&gt;Like does anybody think back to Silas and think that he's a great character?

YesSilas also has a top 3 Edgic strip of all time:

UTRP -&gt; CPN -&gt; CPN -&gt; CPN -&gt; CPN

&lt;3Swap Lex with Clarence and I totally agree."So Coach Bolbi, first three days. What's it been like? How do you find strength with all the hunger and the rain?"

"Well, as Marcus Aurelius once said, 'Slap slap slap! Clap clap clap! Slap slap slap! Clap clap clap!'"OH

my GOD

if you thought running through gnasty's loot and absorbing an unbelievable amount of yellow/pink gems was satisfying before

just imagine doing it WITHOUT HAVING TO COUNT AND CONSTANTLY RE-CHECK YOUR COUNTS after having COUNTED AND RE-CHECKED *EVERY LEVEL OF THE GAME*The system. Is down.

The system. Is down.

The Cheat. Is grounded.Reddit is Spencer and Sucks is Kass.I think it looks good anyway. Plus that layout makes rankings possible which are a big part of (the good parts of) Sucks.My guess is that they were not downvoted when llama first commented.From the roughly 48 seconds I've spent in OT, I think looking terrible is pretty fitting for it.Then the people who only post in Proper would leak elsewhere. Proper needs to stay.Yess, I'm so with you on every word of that Dreamz section. Absolutely agree with you on that deal.

Main difference between your Fiji opinions and mine is I find Lisi entertaining and like Yau a little more, which is balanced out by liking the Edgardo blindside a little less. It's "in the middle" for me in terms of not being bad or good, which by Survivor standards puts it lower on my list. I rank it #22. Ed blindside is fun, Yau and Dreamz are good characters with some really compelling stuff in the endgame, and Earl is really great, but there's so much ugliness, so many forgettable contestants, and such awful twists that I can't really overlook all that and say I straight-up enjoy the whole product. It's a worthwhile season of Survivor that I'm generally happy is a part of Survivor canon, but juuust barely so because so many parts of it are unpleasant or weird. Pretty bad for Survivor but pretty decent on its own.I think Cecilia deserves that note more than Brianna.

Hunter, Angie, and Leslie are my favorites. Not sure how I'd rank them but probably Leslie &gt; Hunter &gt; Angie. Reaaally like all three of them though.The poster blocking script is amazing.Spyro the Dragon! Pokemon - lots of Pokemon! And lots of Spyro! Also Tony Hawk and Ratchet/Clank!&gt;I didn't finish Cagayan

I envy you for that.Abi-Maria is upset with somebody for some duration of time.Three things I'd love to see: 2-1-1 vote at final four; all votes but one Noneified by Idols; someone gives up Immunity but then plays an Idol.It's a real shame for Tony to lose to as few as 6 other people from Cagayan.:( @ him not being wildcarded.

&gt;they showed us multiple times was playing in a way only he could get away with.

My problem is *we absolutely never saw how or why he could get away with any of it, ever.* Like, technically not NEVER because we saw roughly four seconds of him talking to Spencer about being a cop in a scene that was entirely focused on other stuff, but mostly it was just "Here is a spaz who betrays everyone with no remorse. Oh, but he wins because... uh... Big Moves I guess."

That said I completely agree with absolutely every word of the second comment.Oh those were three separate things. I'll make it a list to make that clearer.Yeah the first time reading through the series, Jojen and Meera are so neat! Howland is the cool guy that saved Ned! So when I hear people in the series talking shit about how the crannogmen fight, I feel like it's just prejudice against the "frog-eaters." But then you read that and... yikes.I think Tocantins might be the closest we've come. If Stephen or Erinn had won that challenge, they would have voted for JT while convincing him they were voting for Taj, so it'd be 2 on JT and 1 on Taj. Taj can't vote for herself, so *maybe* Stephen/Erinn tell her the vote is JT... but they have no reason to do so: that risks a 2-2 firemaking challenge in which JT would slaughter either Stephen or Erinn. So most likely Stephen/Erinn keep it safe from Taj so Taj votes for whichever of Stephen/Erinn didn't win Immunity, JT votes for her, and Stephen/Erinn vote for him, and he goes home 2-1-1.

If Taj wins, then it's probably 2-2 between JT and Erinn, and if JT wins, it's the 3-1 we got, but I think Stephen/Erinn winning turns it into a 2-1-1 vote, unless they decide to tell Taj, but I don't think they have any reason to do so.

Definitely would have been exciting. I can't think of any other season in which we came close.Yeah there aren't exact eras but I think these ones are pretty much as on point as possible, but of course even within 1-8 you have a lot of really different stuff going on.

Also to OP I really wouldn't say 21 is in with 22-24 at all.Eating a candy bar.&gt;he really did seem to be genuinely trying to help Anthony out, albeit in the worst and least effective way possible

No, he wasn't. The second Anthony took Rocky's "advice" and started openly defending himself, Rocky just got even angrier and yelled over him. Rocky was just a douche who wanted to be a douche but decided to put up some flimsy pretense of "tryin' to help you out, bro" to make himself look marginally less repulsive than he blatantly was, which is clear in his actual actions.The thing is I don't view Terry in Panama as an amazing underdog. I view him as an annoyance that I want to go away. Casaya Pagonging La Mina is a surreally amazing way for a season to play out for me.Totally with you on HvV Hantz. He himself is repulsive but it gives us the great Sandra win and he's built up as a villain like he finally should be in the later stages... but he's still kind of an anti-hero given undue credit/air time in the early episode so I dunno.

NaOnka is like two separate contestants in one to me. I can't stand Confessional NaOnka where she's just randomly mean-spirited and says gross shit about Kelly Bruno, but TC NaOnka is fucking amazing and hilarious.

I really like Tony as a casting choice and want to be a fan of him but I hate how his story played out in Cagayan in particular. I hate the Tony we got but I think Tony Vlachos the guy is generally entertaining.

Brandon in South Pacific theoretically brings a lot of interesting stuff - his backstory about being in a gang and how he found Jesus and all that and the tragic way it blows up at the end is on its own some of the best shit ever on Survivor - but then he also gets an edit that makes it hard to say I like him as a character when I hate what the show's doing to him, and he himself is just a big ol' cock most of the time, and so much of his air time is devoted to Hantz. So I have no idea how to feel about him because I WANT to like him but at the end of the day he just makes the season ickier for me to think about.That'd be a mess, haha, but if he'd somehow managed to come up with it and orchestrate it on Day 38 he'd be a fucking genius. Both of them voting for Lisa wouldn't happen because it doesn't benefit either of them, but convincing her to vote out Lisa then voting for her would be, like, inhumanly beautiful. I don't think anything like that has happened, someone telling someone else to throw a vote just to take them out. The edit kind of made it look like Russell did that sort of thing to Tyson in HvV but post-game stuff all says Russell didn't do it which honestly is clear if you critically examine even the episode itself. So I can't think of an example of something like what you're saying.As far as my first live reaction goes, definitely Fabio. Others from when I've watched live are HvV Sandra, Bob, Nat White in retrospect, and Denise.I don't know that I'd call myself obviously the best poster, but thank you!

But yeah, diehard Suckster. I'm more active on Reddit recently because my own thread has been so dead but Sucks is my one True love and I'll definitely revive my presence there, hopefully sooner rather than later.Spencer or Stephen go home and Kimmi/Monica/Ciera all get multiple confessionals. Really don't want Angkor to lose again since there's no way Tasha would go home right now and I'd haaate to lose any of the others.Yup!I was going to make some joke about this being the Survivor fan equivalent of "netflix and chill"... but then I thought like fuck I'd let sex interrupt my Survivor viewing, that shit could wait an hour.I'm so happy S31 Jeff Varner is a thing."He was a SNAKE! It should have been HIM!"

"....mm...."

"You're not going ANYWHERE. You're NOT."

"..."

Old Woo's back, everybody!Oh my god Abi-Maria's crazy why is this still surprising meMy gut's making an early call for an Abi-Maria vote tonight. I'd be relatively okay with that. Not my ideal option at all but she's already really, really delivered.Jeremy's growing on me.Oof, "I'm not happy with second place" - per Sabrina, specifically saying that means you may very well get it. Jeremy doesn't really feel like a runner-up to me, but with that quote...When you're playing Survivor with Abi, you can't disagree with her. ...You really can't.Savage is a way better narrator than I feared he might be.Oh this is fun. Calling it a "HERO CHALLENGE" is cringey but the idea is neat.Yeah, they were selling them even before the season so the 2-&gt;3 thing was spoiled.Abi is nuts even by Abi standards, upset that Tasha even had a conversation with Woo after Woo voted for Abi. Jeremy pretended to look for the Idol with Stephen to cover tracks that he has it and strengthen their bond.I was kinda hoping Angkor would go full Matsing and lose, but winning is cool too. Their pre-RC scene was great.You're welcome!This episode is going full PP tone for Savage, dear lord.Kass suddenly being a person is her most chaotic trick yet.Oh my gosh this scene is adorable."Oh, ye of little faith" - Kass to all of /r/survivor right now.If Monica takes out Spencer that'll be like my favorite thing ever omg.Obligatory nitpicking: She's had confessionals in 3 of 4 episodes. She ain't purple. Just UTR.

But she clearly has been waaay smaller than him so yeah it'd be hilarious/amazing if she suddenly rips the rug out from under him.Why on Earth is Ciera getting so little air time? Probst openly loves her. :( Feels like she's not even on the season.This challenge needs Yakety Saxjfc joeMore like Ta Kejoe"AAAAH IT'S SO BRIGHT"/u/DabusSister after Woo's scream: "Was that my boyfriend??"Happy about Bayon winning. Not enough seeds for Spencer to go home yet so with this edit it probably would have been Monica which no thanks.

I don't want Angkor to lose but I also don't remember who's on Ta Keo.gee i wonder if angkor keeps losing because you put them on an empty and awful campI hope Savage suddenly quitsIf only Amy were on one of the other tribes.omg fuck this if jeff goesHey, that's us! Jeff means us! Hi, Jeff!Jeff/Abi platonic showmance ftw &lt;333This is a really fun and unique TC. And Probst isn't even pushing any of it.

Jeff has the better history but I think Woo is making the better points but I hope Jeff stays./u/DabusSister: "KEEP HIM. HE'S SO PRETTY."Abi with the obnoxious quote of the evening &lt;3NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKass also compared him to Russell Hantz and said he was a goat (was it you who said that Kass isn't supposed to be a reliable narrator to invalidate that? It might have been someone else.) We got nothing involving most of the people he actually betrayed and we got nothing explaining why people continued to trust him. I don't walk away from those episodes with any idea why Jeremiah, Woo, LJ, and Sarah vote for Tony.This is reaaaally surprising. I wasn't sure Jeff would win but I definitely thought he'd be a merge boot if he lost.

Not pleased about the outcome, and that's even as a pretty big Woo fan. Jeff was great. But at least now Jeff 2.0 can go down as an excellent pre-merger and I wouldn't be surprised to see him come back. And it was a really good episode, definitely better than last week's.I think only four episodes in is too early to say so since she got a decent amount of content in the premiere. Unless someone were straight-up irrelevant by now I don't think you can really say they're outright purple.Crafted how?What was the positive SPV? I don't remember her getting any.

Not that I doubt it or anything because I'd love to know about any second of focus Ciera's gotten. I just don't remember it.Probably #1. Happy I went with someone else instead.hairy ass trumanCow and Chicken freaked me out for the same reasonSo much for our dreams.Sandra had a much stronger story in HvV (which is a more comparable and modern season) than Kelley has had right now. There's no way Kelley wins, she's bland MOR white noise to try and distract from and drown out our golden boys of **Jeremy** ^^^and ^^^Spencer. I've had her eliminated from contention for weeks, longer than a lot of the other contestants even, since getting a lot of content that means nothing honestly may be worse than getting little content at all.The best last act of anyone ever is /u/shutupredneckman's last comment being "That's a very good point." &lt;333 Even if he remembers the password I hope that account stays that way forever.shh bby is ok:(What's fun is I also wanted to do that write-up because &lt;3 SUE &lt;3 but would have taken an almost *totally different* approach to explaining why she's so amazing. Sue is a constellation.I hope Jeremy and Spencer somehow both go home tonight and editing analysis implodesyou gotta give it aaaaaalllllllll or nothin' at alllllllAutoMod already destroyed it, finally.Wait, Keith didn't know? ..................The fuck?Hunahpu ownage &lt;3

SJDS &lt;3 I didn't see anything after Kelley's confessional right when Jeremy and Spencer started talking. Did I miss anything?

edit: So basically, no. thx y'all! &lt;3Keith will win this. Southern people are great at climbing"Meanwhile, if *Leslie* wins... Nothing for her, I guess. Sorry."Yay choosing dilemmas these are so much better than teams &lt;333"No real logic"

Keith in a nutshell everybodyGod I love KeithIs villain Tasha going to come at KEITH'S expense because FUCK NOEh. Coming closer to catching up, but still, both Jeremy and Spencer have told us Jeremy would win that jury vote. It was a good scene for him but Jeremy is still the clear frontrunner.mom's spaghettiGarrett's lingering effect on TashaBefore anyone asks, Abi-Maria is two days off from being a Scorpio. She was born Oct 21, Scorpio is Oct 23 - Nov 21. She is a Libra.I like this bot. It is a good bot.ugh obstacle courses and puzzles i want more balancingOh that's cute about the puzzle. I like that.Fuck man this shit's one of my worst fears open water's fucking freakyYeah how dare she feel emotional after *almost drowning*If you fuck with her you are *literally dead*"You're never gonna find me in Brazil" omg &lt;3So Keith is now RudyOh god *ew* this fucking rhetoric.

Guess who the fans also voted on? Keith, Wentworth, and Abi.*Please* tell me this isn't actually something we're supposed to root for, this crap Tasha's spewing. "It would be a disservice if anyone but Tasha, Spencer, and Jeremy won when the fans voted for them! ...I mean, you voted for everyone else too, but you *really* meant the ones who say 'strategy' a lot, right?"why am i not hearing more of this delicious accentSurvivor: Cambodia - Sponsored by NintendoNever thought I'd hear Keith say the words "reign supreme"Right? jfc. I hope the producers aren't wanting us to actually eat that up and root for it. Like "Hey, you voted for all these people - but you *really* meant the ones who say 'strategy' a lot!"abi final words hypeThere are two Idols on opposite sides who would each play theirs if the other one stood up to play theirs and only six people left and Probst was holding the urn so probably every vote is negated.Chase and Sash each played an Idol on themselves at the F6 Tribal Council of Nicaragua (after which their Idols were expired.) LJ and Tony each played an Idol on one another at the Cagayan merge. Not two different people but Parvati played one Idol each on Jerri and Sandra at the HvV merge.I think it depends on the season or it's the day # or something. Either way I know F6 was the last time there since that's why they both played theirs even though everyone knew neither of them were going home.I love this explanation.Lill's easily in my all-time top 18 \u00af\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00afYickles returning from the grave just to be above even noticing anything anyone said about him &lt;333I could dig up the Rich thing later today if you and/or /u/wilburdes really want it, I have Borneo on DVD

(Also I think it was oranges and not apples, though I guess that's kind of comparing apples to oranges)

edit: jk its already thereGood write-up for a godly Survivor character. Rudy is fucking hilarious and I love that he of all people somehow truly understood Survivor sooner than anybody else.Praise Burnett and his glorious rigging &lt;3Pearl Islands deserves it.I was hoping for some picture of Randy being smiley and friendly that I'd totally forgotten.Oh wow I didn't realize that either. Randy &lt;3&gt;wanting to make me specifically happy haha.

I'm like 47% sure this is why they cast Tina Wesson on BvW.How were you beaten at your own game?Right, how the fuck does *Twila* just come up with that. God she's amazing.&gt;we get the shuffle

Thank you for making me realize I should switch what I'm listening to from "Human Touch" to "The Wild, the Innocent, &amp; the E Street Shuffle."

I'd def have Twila higher but you clearly praised her highly and other people could explain even more emphatically than I could why they'd rank her even higher than I do so yeah.Love your take on Palau, though of course I rank it higher. But I haven't ever really considered it in the light of an especially dark season, just a great one. I'm fiddling with and wearing my new Koror buff right now as I get caught up in here, actually &lt;3 God I love that season. Tom's not my favorite but since this write-up is more about his season than him, I'm happy it got Idol'd and I look forward to a more in-depth Tom write-up that may help me appreciate him and his magnificent season even more than I already do.I can't wait for juicy spicy details &lt;33Now I could be wrong on this since I haven't re-read it since it was posted (I definitely will before my next Borneo viewing though), but as I recall, I remember it being a lot more focused on Sue's story than anything. All the stuff she went through in the game and I remember the whole setup of how she had a past, present, and future in a way few to *no* other contestants do. Which is all totally awesome stuff. But for me I think I'd have been less focused on her *story* and more on Sue *herself*: I think she, in a vacuum, even without Kelly, is one of the absolute best casting choices ever and basically everything you could ever want a Survivor contestant to be. If you want emotion, Sue. If you want strategy, Sue. If you want some unique, creative strategic social maneuvering, Sue. If you want complexity or hilarity or drama or conflict or great narration, Sue - she hits *every* single tone. Like how I lined up all the pins of why Phillip Sheppard is awful and knocked them down one at a time because he's bad in virtually every single way a Survivor contestant can be bad? Sue is the exact opposite. She is a fantastic contestant and casting choice in virtually every way you could ever want a Survivor character to impress you. So I think I'd have been more focused on that - a point-by-point elaboration of HERE ARE ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH SUE MAKES SURVIVOR BETTER LITERALLY ANY AND EVERY TIME SHE EVER DOES ANYTHING OR EVERYTHING - than the more story- and plot-based study and analysis of Sue as a human being even outside the game.

Which isn't at all to say I didn't like Neckman's write-up because it was great. It was just, iirc, very different from what I was planning, and the fact that both of those kinds of write-ups are possible just further highlights what an insanely marvelous addition to Survivor canon she is &lt;3Maybe I'm an idiot but who's between Ian and RichardJust saw and edited that oops&gt;Chris is the best confessionalist in survivor history. I refuse to hear any arguments to the contrary.

^^^^courtneyyatestho

Anyhoo. I think I may focus on Chris on a Vanuatu rewatch in addition to Ami - and Eliza because I totally don't get what the deal is with her as a big favorite? - because I feel a little less high on him than I used to (by which I mean he used to be top 10, which now he's definitely not and more around the bottom of top 20, and now I'm wondering if he even belongs in top 30.) You're right that he's a magnificent casting choice and totally owns his revenge story. But what I guess doesn't connect with me as much is like, when you say it's *all* because of Chris that the endgame played out that way... I don't totally agree with that. I used to think Vanuatu was a season whose strength was this one unbelievable character that totally shaped and wrote this amazing endgame, but increasingly I'm realizing that, no, he's a *part* of it for sure, a major part, but with the Leann/Ami downfall that's a lot more Leann, Ami, Eliza, and Scout than it is Chris, and it's what kicks off his arc. So instead of relying on one BRILLIANT character I think Vanuatu's strength is a wealth of great characters and while on paper the endgame looks so Chris-centric, I don't know that it really is. Also he says a lot of sexist shit that definitely bugs me more now than it did when I was like fifteen.Oh that's fun. &lt;3 I really should revisit more of those more often than I do. Probably will in the buildup to my eventual personal ranking.Just realized that myself and came here to edit it.

What about between Sandra and Coach? The others I obviously know. So I guess I could cross-check with the spreadsheet but eh.omg wait i didnt know it was time to vote : ( can i vote and u can change the top 6 places accordingly????Dammit I was going to make a pound-for-pound joke but you beat me to it

Outstaaaanding Yates write-up actually and you definitely did her justice. I think a lot of Courtney write-ups would fall back on a list of quotes - which is a totally legit way to do a Courtney Yates write-up because, like, it's Courtney Yates - but I love the observations on how despite getting relatively little air time she actually probably got the right amount (which makes me see what you meant on pound-for-pound entertaining... ha, it does work both ways with her) and how she brings out the best in everyone around her. And I agree that her story is actually kind of sweet and uplifting &lt;3

Of course the bulk of her is her humor but there are other layers, too, and some of the ones you named are ones I hadn't even really thought about. I love that Survivor history has such an awesome blatant fan favorite (for this fanbase at least) as Courtney Yates. &lt;3 I'm so happy she exists and there's someone like her that we can all agree is totally fantastic.*Lill

My god though, Lill is amaaaazing (my one disagreement is that I also like her fine in the pre-merge; I see her as more Sonja or Leslie than, like, Patricia) and you're right that it's kind of hard to peg her despite knowing she's amazing. She's just... She's a blatant early boot who's then artificially, randomly transplanted into not just any post-merge but *the* most "post-merge-y" post-merge of *all* post-merges, basically the most cutthroat clusterfuck of "voting blocs" comprised of self-absorbed and/or grating blowhards we've ever seen, and the end result of that weird transplant - of seeing a Leslie Nease accidentally make the post-merge of Survivor: The Amazon - is just... such an indescribable, surreal, erratic combination of emotional, epic, and hilarious. God bless Lillian Morris &lt;33333 (Don't say that about God! ;~~~~~~;)So basically Hodor is the Lill to your Fairplay &lt;3Wording like that honestly sounds more like something Brian would say to Clay after being crowned the winner.

...In fact I'd almost like Brian if he had done exactly that.Oh! With the machete and the shark? Okay cool. I can dig that, though I think I'd have opted for him on the buoy, even though... fuck it, *especially because* that's also Ian's picture.Word I guess I was sort of more saying, like, my previous opinions than yours. Like arguing with myself or something. But okay, actually, I like that take - Chris not as someone who's the total absolute star of Van but who *is* an outlet for the other characters (some of whom may be even better than him) to have their stories work. Though my minor hesitation there is that the big big downfall is more an internal Yasur thing.

Hmm, adds how?I've only ever heard it as a derogatory term against Asian-Americans, so maybe it just depends where you are.[A typical photograph of Tom Westman](http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/album_review/d83bc9cd0a1b4bed49cecb06bf564aab752a8260.JPG)Fabio and Ami are basically the same characterI feel like Rupert, more than any other contestant, doesn't even really need a write-up. Just, like, a photo of him and "It's fucking *Rupert.*" And that's appropriate for absolutely any place.Thank you for the insight then! Just a matter of context and I guess I heard it in a shitty one. It's definitely not something I'm way confident in or think I've heard a bunch of times, and your experience is probably more reflective of general usage than mine.&gt;I made a nom-nom with fleaa for him to nominate Rupert 2.0 and I\u2019d renominate Hayden

I love this deal.

&gt;I told Slicer I\u2019d leave Parv 3.0 until the top 100 if he idoled Todd

I do not love this deal.

&gt;I wanted Vytas to make the top 4 for Blood vs Water, so I asked Hodor who I could nominate for him to cut. He told me Tina would be first out of those remaining, so he agreed to cut her as long as I nominated Cao Boi the next round.

I am going to pretend I did not read any part of this

&gt;Yickles and I agreed that I\u2019d leave Jefra until 125 if he left Dan L until then.

THIS IS THE BEST DEAL OF ALL THE DEALS OMFG &lt;3333

&gt;Slicer wanted me to keep Vee until 80, so I agreed if he kept Rory until then.

Also this one &lt;3

&gt;I agreed to nominate Russ Swan if he nominated Sophie.

....................fuck everything

Damn though that endgame collusion is strong.

Anyways this was neat to read so thanks &lt;3I'll have rewatched Africa by then and my redemption storyline can be playing all of my Idols on LexNah. Overrating her in BvW is /u/ExtraLifeBalloon's job. I don't think she's even my #1 for BvW and she almost definitely isn't in my top 100 for that season.How'd that end up happening?:( Judd getting cut over Vecepia would be the best thing. Oh well.Whoa now, I was being serious. I thought it was actually entertaining to see people be like "I bet it's this thing I said!" "No, it's this thing I said!" then you're like "um i dont remember any of that lol"I don't think there's anything to suggest she didn't buy it herselfThe Interesting Man commercials and Chuck Norris jokes both predate Survivor: TocantinsI don't think it's *hating* Tyson. I think it's just "Tyson is not one of the 17 best or most memorable players in Survivor history."A poll could be more efficient and do multiple seasons at once without potentially looking like a karma grab (though I don't really care either way.)Nah, R/B/Y are easy as fuck with only one Pokemon. I'm going for a LivingDex in Red and the only thing I've actually used is Buddy the Blastoise.To be fair, Neckman isn't people.Which things? I vaguely remember being technically True about a couple things and I'll probably be like "Ohhhh, yeah. Well that was definitely True!" when you remind me.My head's a-spinnin' reading all of thisAlmost alol'd. Never change &lt;3 It's taken a few months but I can finally start to find the Alex thing funnyI think her [Edgic strip](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v173/Warrior25/Edgic%20Charts%203/S-31RC-Episode%2012_zpst5tq1adt.gif) (up through last week) kind of explains it. It doesn't connect because there's no real connection for anything with her. They used her when convenient but also had her disappear entirely for like a month and a half - including, like you said, the Woo vote where she was actually relevant in a way that fulfilled a story they'd already set up.Rewatches and the analysis of rankdowns could also shift some things.

Or some kind of rule about not cutting whoever you cut in the previous one.So if Hodor is Colby and Slicer is Jerri, when is their wedding?Plot twist: There is actually only one Joe fan; she just has very many fake Facebook accountsI only vaaaguely remember doing that ranking thing. I don't totally remember what yo mean there actually.

But oh yeah with Mike I did make a lot of deals - to *save* him, though, since I wanted Mike still in. So what I think you're thinking of is kind of the opposite: to save Mike I'd make, like, basically the same deal to multiple people. Like tell two different people "Hey, I won't cut X if you don't cut Mike!" when X is the same person or I was never cutting X anyway. Like I think I made one Mike-for-Cirie deal and lol like fuck I'd ever cut Cirie in any place, and I think I made x-for-Twila deals with multiple people or something, like having one person keep Mike safe in exchange for Twila and then have someone else keep some other contestant safe in exchange for Twila. Something like that.

I wish I remembered it all better but maybe I did write it down in one of the endgame threads. But stuff like that I vaguely remember.

I think trying to time out Idols was *relatively* standard, and my most(/only?) deceptive Idol thing was along those lines. When Neckmangel played his third Idol on Dawngel, we were debating who should do it, since that would be his third of three Idols (nobody else ran out of Idols for over 100 places after that), and meanwhile it would have been my first, and I'd been the only person with three Idols for over *200* places before that. :P So by all rights, since he had only one and nobody else used up their last one for a while, and meanwhile I had been the *only* 3-Idol holder for ages, I "should" have been the one to play it to keep everyone with a relatively even number of Idol power left.

But maaaybe Neckman would end up wanting to play an Idol on one of the very few contestants he ranks above Dawn (like maybe Eliza or Ciera or something), so I didn't want to use my Idol on Dawn there. So while we were debating in chat who should Idol her first, I intentionally waited to reply to one of his messages until *right* when I was about to leave school (with the 24h mark ending while I was on my ride home.) That way - without lying - I could say "Shit, dude, I have to get offline since my sister is picking me up *right now* and it's about to hit the 24 hour time limit so please just Idol her because I literally don't have time to post it." I wasn't able to play it because I had to get offline - but I only had to get offline because I replied slowly in order to time it out.

So I basically forced his hand into Idoling Dawn (I was 100% sure that he would Idol her; the night before I lied [I think the only time I lied :(] and said "I might not be able to get online tomorrow", to try and make him play it that night, and he assured me that he could get online and would Idol her if I wasn't there.) By doing so I managed to further protect Dawn by ensuring two Idols (his and mine) would go her way (although that was almost guaranteed regardless, but now it *was* guaranteed); I played defensively on my own opinions and offensively on his by ensuring he would become unable to play an Idol on anyone he liked that I didn't care about; and I got to maintain my three-Idol status that I loved so very much.

It was partially strategy on the off-chance he wanted to Idol someone besides Dawn, but also just a status move because I thought it was fun to have only three Idols and I thought it was especially fun to have someone else use all theirs before I even used one.What kinds of deals do you mean?At least with Kelley you can say she's kind of a walking MOR/CP-toneless to begin with. The real insanity is *Keith* having tone ONCE.I *bet* you'll figure it out eventually!Ooh gotcha. Yeah, my top priority would probably be precisely that. Of course I'd also just have to sort of emotionally separate from it and tell myself at the outset, "Okay, Dabu. Even if they keep horrible All-Stars people, RI people, Rocky, and Hantz... that's not your fault. You're doing what you can and any awful results like that aren't on you."I wouldn't for a second. Richard, Sue, Rob, Jerri, Rupert, Tina, Tom, Stephenie, Colby, other Rob, Sandra, Cirie, Russell H., Coach, Ozzy, James C., Colleen, Fairplay literally just off the top of my head.There are like thousands of people on this subredditMediocre ballot IMO. Jerri is fantastic and should have been in there years ago before anybody else post-Borneo other than *maybe* Rupert and JFP. Coach would be good in a couple years so he's *acceptable* now compared to some of the alternatives like Tyson or Tony or something, but if we're just voting for a colorful character, Sue and Rupert are two way better and more historically significant choices off the top of my head. And there are way more skilled, significant, and colorful winners than Todd who haven't been in there.Well yeah I absolutely am, just like everyone who's voting for Jerri is, which includes Cochran himself. I think who's memorable is based in part on who actually impacted the show or was on the show when it was a big deal culturally. Yeah and I am saying that for me, like for him, historical significance and impact are a part of "memorable player" (which for me would also be part of the HoF but that's a different conversation - but clearly for some people it is.)Yeah I agree with this.I think it's positive for Cochran in certain contexts but negative for the abysmal trainwreck that was Caramoan.Yet Neckman is the evil one who makes every disagreement personal and can't handle when people disagree. Okay.\u00af\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af

Like I said, though, there was strategy to it!I think it was Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But I remember that! I read about it on Cracked. I admire her dedication.Then those fans are also wrongDefinitely without question. "America's Sweetheart" of the first season and, along with Rudy, the closest thing to a hero in the *original* Survivor - and the only one outside of the Alliance, and the last one standing outside of it. The original Survivor is not even close to the same without Colleen there as a sweet but snarky underdog - she's one of the top two fan favorites in the biggest and most important season in the history of the show from before it was even a regular show with seasons - and holds up on rewatches. Has added far more to and is far more important to the franchise than John Cochran, would be one of the very first people I'd induct and the only reason she isn't a three-time player is because she doesn't want to be. If she had even the slightest amount of interest I think they'd do a whole returning player season just to see her back. Absolutely could(/should/would, if she wanted to) have been on All-Stars and/or Heroes.Well the point of Jerri is that she *isn't* popular and loved, haha.

I don't know that I'd say Cochran is one of the most popular characters ever when didn't win the fan popularity contest in either of his two seasons and, in the first one, lost it (to his rival) by the single widest margin in the history of the award.

If you ask people in general which Survivors they remember, of which *current* Survivor fans are only a small sample, an enormous amount would say Jerri, or would have several years after her season, than would say Cochran now or during his seasons. Jerri was a major and influential part of the show when it was monumentally bigger in the cultural landscape than it is now, and probably contributed in large part *to* it being as big as it was.

If you narrow down the pool of people only to those who have watched John Cochran on Survivor then you are painting a very incomplete picture of Survivor's history, audience over time, and place in American pop culture.And I think the reason we don't get those satisfying fan favorites losing anymore is also because Survivor edits the show differently. They stopped giving us winners like Vecepia and Jenna a long time ago - which is why now we can narrow it down and know that, say, Kimmi and Abi-Maria are never going to win with their edits, when in the earliest seasons you can't be so sure of that. Now they tend to more or less present ever winner as satisfying, where in an earlier season, maybe Natalie A, Rob M, or Tyson don't get as big of winner edits and Keith/Ashley/Tina are fan favorites, just because back then the storytelling wasn't as focused on "Here! We want you to like the winner!"

Basically in modern Survivor there is like 0 chance we'd ever get a story like Vecepia stomping on Kathy and winning when the first 12 episodes were all building up to a Kathy win, not because the final three makes it impossible but because they wouldn't build the story that way.Doesn't matter why they watched and that isn't even remotely close to what I said, respectively.Yeah, from a production standpoint it is probably better at retaining viewers, but for the episodes and seasons themselves it definitely isn't as good to watch.Well Kimmi is amazing so there you go

If the producers/editors won't give her attention at least our little corner of the Internet is doing what it can to compensate and I love and thank the mods for itOnly if they're going to make it huger.Plus this season he had the midlife quest storyline, made llama references in his pre-show stuff which obviously this sub will love, wanted to be out there for a reaaaally easy reason to root for, has gone out of his way to interact greatly with fans, and had a fucking brilliant relationship with Abi-Maria.&gt;Do you think Survivor cares (or should care) about people who tuned out 15 years ago?

In something like a "Hall of Fame", absolutely. What I would choose in something like this is the most memorable and significant figures in the history of the show, and Survivor that was watched by *tens of millions* of people when Survivor actually really mattered in the cultural landscape of the country is far more significant than season twenty- or thirty-something in the era of "That show's still on?", on top of making those seasons possible. I think you would have a very hard time finding someone from as late in the show's run as season 23, when it has a fraction of the viewers, who matters as much to the development and history of that show as someone in the second season when it had more viewers than in any other season. It was laying the framework and it was actually a big deal culturally, the show actually mattered then.

I mean if you disagree that's fine (which is kind of a problem with this Hall of Fame, since is it going for players, characters, human beings, etc.) but it's not like it's an illogical train of thought or a hard one to follow. My first picks would be the ones who were the most integral to the fundamental development of the game and show and the ones who were the most significant at the time when the show was the most significant. 

* * *

I think "enormously popular" and especially "one of the most popular and beloved characters the show has ever had" are big stretches someone who has gone 0-2 for popularity contests. When he wasn't the most popular in either of his two seasons - South Pacific, in which someone else won by the widest margin in the history of that poll, and Caramoan, in which he got an incredibly visible and favorable edit, both personal and strategic, every episode for weeks up to the voting - when he isn't even the most popular contestant in either season (and doesn't even rank top two, possibly even lower than 3, in his bigger and more positive one), I think it's hard to say he's one of the most "enormously popular" ever.I dunno, speaking just for myself I like Tasha but absolutely hated that quote.dag now i gotta get caught up n shitHuh. I thought I'd bet on him. Guess I was worried that with how much focus he gets he had better content I don't remember.FWIW, the reason she was cut is that the ranker thought she *wasn't* in-depth and thought she was a hard-to-believe, one-note character in a way that detracted from the story. If you do read it that's the gist of it. I also don't agree, though.Wooo! Having not read the books in a couple years I was holding off on Dean since I didn't know if he had some more fun content than I remembered, but I felt like he didn't and wanted him out. So yay, I'm happy he's here. Better than Katie Bell, still not great or necessary, thanks for attending Hogwarts, see ya later.At a glance it looks like he is, but I don't think that that really represents too much about popularity on the show.

* Either his or Rob's followers still make up a very, very small % of Survivor viewers - like barely more than 1%, if that (which of course isn't also considering that their followers might come from other pursuits they have or their real-life families, friends, and social networks that have nothing to do with popularity on the show.)

* Many of those followers could come from just being more active and/or witty on Twitter than on other contestants. If somebody never really Tweets (and Cochran *used* to tweet a lot, at least, and still does semi-regularly), they probably won't get as many followers; somebody may not even use Twitter at all; or somebody may use it but not go for witty zingers as much as Cochran does - and absolutely none of those have to do with the show itself.

* Cochran also was on the show more recently after Twitter became a big thing. If Twitter had existed earlier in the show's run, it is pretty likely that contestants like Richard or Colleen or Colby or  Stephenie or whoever else would have gotten a bunch of followers at the time and still have them now: his greater number of followers doesn't necessarily mean he was more popular or noteworthy during his seasons as those contestants were during theirs; his seasons aired when Twitter had already become a big, popular website, while it didn't even exist for much of Survivor's run.

So yeah, he is, and good for him for succeeding on social media - but when Twitter *can't* represent how popular early contestants were during their seasons because it didn't exist, Twitter followers can just come from Twitter activity/entertainment rather than show popularity... and every single one of his or any contestant's followers still is just a small, small percentage of the people who actually watch the show (again assuming they all come from the show at all [which surely the overwhelming majority do]), I don't think it really represents the Survivor audience accurately or says much about his popularity on the show.I think Pig is some effective minor comic relief and I'm happy he uselessly fluttered this far &lt;33Haha, I think that post is funny, the OP one I mean. I'm gonna remember that and use it.Pig is not a person!How on Earth did Pig get so few bets??Bloody Baron's fuuuucked up but him making this far I guess shows that we aren't totally doing likability/personality, since he's, y'know, a freaking murderer. I think with the backstory his presence around a bunch of kids is pretty unsettling. But yeah, I think he has a neat little role as someone who starts off as kind of a typical "Yay, Quirky Hogwarts!" character but gets some unexpected development at the end. It's not much so this is a good spot for him, but it's a worthwhile little story.Yay, stats! &lt;3 Thanks.Dang, I'm wondering who I voted for if it's not, like, Baron/Marge but also ones who aren't getting cut yet.Yay, minor likable Hufflepuff! Definitely overdue, happy to see her out, but at least she helps color Hufflepuff a teensy bit more, even if it's in generic DA/Battle of Hogwarts ways that also apply to like every single Hogwarts protagonist. And she has some quirky moments. I'm okay with her still being here.With her it's just a lack of good to say, really.grrRIP Odo :(I think Aragog is especially valuable for characterizing Hagrid. As far as the Hagrid's "Pets" thing goes I'd have him above Fang, below Fluffy. Totally good with this ranking. He's a valuable footnote.&gt;Hufflepuff | 1 | 3.03%

BOOM. WUT.Sounds like you should have gone against your instincts and made some choices you thought were less likely. Y'know, taken a Bagshot in the dark.You put most of my vague thoughts and feelings about Bathilda Bagshot into more and better words than I could have! Hooray! I may have cut her next and my write-up would have been this but, like, crappier. I'd be interested in seeing a post about her.

I haven't really thought about who I'd cut so if anyone has some NON-HARRY characters they think should be out, feel free to plead your case. I've got like three I'm thinking between but haven't thought in-depth yet.......................ohYes.The Lex and Courtney Yates ones were good.Actually Anthony is like my favorite of those three and I think he's a good character on his own

Also my least favorite part of the Sue episode is and always has been the Chapera stuff afterwards anyway.Yeah, that's very silly on his part. The only thing that can make a rankdown invalid is **~ &lt;3 Baylor &lt;3 ~** not making #1.whoa&gt;4) I am willing to admit that Phillippines has more flaws than I thought it did in the beginning

What kinds of flaws? I probably agree, just curious.&gt;I thought watching him change himself to try to win survivor rather than just be himself on the island and the resultant smackdown

In what ways do you think Coach changed himself? I feel like his philosophy was pretty similar all three times he played.

Also would be interested in your take on Jonclyn (&lt;3) and what you mean: re new school in #4whoa didn't expect to see that username

hiWay to break up the rhyming.John Carroll, Neleh Dennis, Deena Bennett, Vecepia Towery.You are missing so much good shitMakes sense, have fun! I love both Borneo and Australia.Gay people are completely capable of reproduction. They choose not to reproduce. No more an illness than anyone else who doesn't reproduce for whatever reason.I'm so happy Smells Like Nirvana was the top post.Dammit, beaten to it!

Bruce himself said he's "ambivalent" on BITUSA, and I am, too. It has some stuff I'm not too big on... but this song? This song is fucking awesome. Very first one that turned me on to him. I always knew this album's title track growing up, and I loved it, but when I heard this one on the radio, I *really* loved it and decided I had to look this guy up. And now he is far and away my favorite and most-played artist ever.

I have some complaints about this album and some disappointment about its relative success... but none of them have a damn thing to do with this song for even a second.Track 11 off the *Tracks* box set of previously unreleased material (though admittedly, I first heard it on *18 Tracks*, the abridged version, where it was track 2 - but it was first released as a track 11!)

Dancing in the Dark is a Track 11 that first got me intrigued by Bruce; this Track 11 is one of the very first that got me really *interested.* After hearing Dancing, I grabbed two of his albums at the library. 18 Tracks was one, and I fell in love with it immediately. This song was and remains an incredibly fun, catchy standout from that album. It convinced me at the time that looking into the Boss was a good idea, and today, even with ~200 more songs by him in my library and him easily my favorite music artist of all time, it's still an excellent one I can always fall back on and sing along to for a hell of an enjoyable 3 minutes.They seemed so nice from the part about supporting hate crimesNah, gender and sexual orientation are different. Cis = your gender identity matches your biological sex, regardless of your sexual orientation. So, as a biological male who identifies as a male and is attracted to males, I am cis and gay.okay but look they put the word "feminist" in **RED** come on you can't call feminists valid after *that*

it's in RED dammitdragon and kids' book.

Everyone is different. No two people are ~~the same~~ not on fire.That's fucking amazing.

Or I guess I should say: SO GOOD!!!Abi-Maria, Ciera, Kimmi, Kelly, Keith, Joe, almost certainly not Kelley or Stephen, probably not Savage or Tasha.Cochran and Tyson's edits had nothing to do with fans knowing they made F3 before their seasons even started airing^^^^^^maybeLikely not. Haha what I love is how at first you weren't even going to engage me on it, just say something dismissive because it's all my stupid and weird Lex opinions deserve... but then 24 hours you had to come back when you realized just *how* stupid and weird they were. You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.Terry shocked me but then I remembered the spoiler thing. I wonder if/how much the gap between pre-premiere and post-premiere remaining will widen as episodes go on? As always, thanks for compiling and presenting this! I look forward to seeing more big contenders out as the weeks go on.Good quiz. Loved "The Amanda Kimmel" being there. Nicaragua and Sabrina really tripped me up, and I totally forgot Kristina forgot one.Another teeny thing: You have to type "Jason Siska" for him. "Jason" should also be acceptable.You're welcome!You're welcome! Thanks for making/posting.You for asking the question. That's what you get for throwing a challenge. You just got Drew Christy'd.Ranking of all the Samoa/Nicaragua/Philippines ones (overall rankings out of 28 because I have to rewatch 8/16):

**1. Nicaragua (#7 overall)** - All-time fantastic cast make this an incredibly entertaining season. Delivers funny and memorable content basically every week.

**2. SJDS (#8)** - Time and an eventual rewatch (or re-re-rewatch? watched each episode 3 times as it aired) will help me decide where exactly it should rank, but right now I remember it as a fantastic season with excellent development of a brilliant cast of characters that came together in fascinating, shocking, awesome twists. All I could ever ask for out of modern Survivor (which makes me think I should probably rank it #7 over Nicaragua but I'll need to rewatch it to really lock that down or not, since I do love the Nicaragua cast even more.)

**3. Heroes vs. Villains (#10)** - It has Rupert voting for Sandra to win after Colby calls Russell Hantz delusional, and also Tom Westman played an Idol. Can I really ask for more than that? ...maybe, yeah, but still, this season is very fun.

**4. Philippines (#15)** - Matsing.

**5. Cagayan (#19)** - Fantastic premiere and great merge episode. Decent pre-merge, other than the painfully "meh" Brice boot episode ("Jeremiah is the CP4 swing vote" is exactly as fun as it sounds.) But after all that it falls apart with, for me, a really unsatisfying winner story and some borderline unwatchable episodes thanks to the absurd amount of/focus on Hidden Immunity Idols. The Morgan through Tasha boots comprise one of the absolute worst strings of episodes in Survivor history. But hey, at least Kass grinned all those times and Garrett Adelstein is a thing.

**6. One World (#20) &amp; 7. Blood vs. Water (#21)** - [mrw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4qzU39jK-8&amp;t=6s)

**8. Worlds Apart (#23)** - Max boot is great. Some of the other late pre-merge stuff is kind of fun. Shirin and Jenn are always good times. But those are just diamonds in the rough... the very, very dark and expansive rough. At its worst this season was some of the most frustrating, unwatchable rubbish in the history of the show; at its best, outside of the Nina and Max boot episodes, it was just disappointingly mediocre. There's just nothing here worth the price of admission, even before you factor in that that price is the most absurdly unlikable group of endgamers in Survivor history.

**9. South Pacific (#24)** - Thank God for Sophie. (...guess it's kind of ironic to say that about the one non-religious member of the dominant tribe.)

**10. Samoa (#25)** - Could/should have been amazing but with the edit we got this shit's just depressing to watch.

**11. Caramoan (#27)** - The absolute worst storytelling of all time that reduced virtually every contestant to a UTR1 nothing, a bland gamebot, an obnoxious caricature, or a combination of the three - or just wildly changed a contestant's role in the story week to week with no explanation whatsoever. Throw in Brandon, the absurd amount of Phillip airtime, and the chorus of trumpets that blare every time John Cochran opens his mouth and you have a virtually unwatchable TV product that makes me need a shower.

**12. Redemption Island (#28)** - lol&gt;fuck that perfect smile of his

For example, replying to a post with "gee, sounds like someone has been reading the bootlist" can signify that whatever was being talked about is a spoiler, even though it is not said. If you have concerns about a post, message the moderators and use the "report" button and we will look into it.

THANK YOU for this. I once got spoiled by exactly this. Somebody commented on their predictions, and it looked maybe slightly sketchy but it could have just been someone half-assing their commentary so I really didn't think much of it... but then all the replies said "Wow, way to spoil" or whatever and then I can figure it's probably a spoiler.

If you're spoiled, then yeah, someone naming what'll happen looks pretty blatant... but to people who aren't, it's just another prediction, until you start commenting outright saying that it's not.I think it's more because those conversations often turn into people reacting to the boot list which can sometimes be a spoiler in itself.OP ain't callin' him a truther!oofWhy do you think that's the case for Nicaragua?Top 2/3 is too high for JuddRight before FTC. Decent chance of getting a good edit, almost certainly means you were a threat... and more prize money than any other place.Heh, I was planning to ask for responses in PMs but nobody has sent in any, so maybe this is harder than I thought, and I could remove the gold aspect and just see if people manage to get them at all?Okay now that was well playedI *FUCKING* LOVE HOUSE MANDERLY.

I'll have to read those other posts. Here's to vengeance, justice, pie, and blood!Written by Charlie Kelly to try and woo the Waitress.

It did not work.CroppingI don't get how splitting up the tribes by age went poorly at all. The divisions are kind of incidental and it gave us two tribes with lots of memorable dynamics that I found way entertaining. I also really don't get how the Medallion of Power can be an "enormous flop" when it was an afterthought in four episodes. That's like saying Vanuatu sucks because of Brady Finta.

Unlikable players is more subjective I guess? But even then I don't know who he'd really mean besides NaOnka.

I don't get why the double quit is so bad. What do you dislike about it? I thought it was a really satisfying, dramatic, unique episode. What about that hurts the season?

I agree that Nicaragua doesn't have a lot of "big moments" but I don't think it needs them; it just stays consistently fun and engaging a lot of the time.I meant out of the places in which you can get voted out, the ones the question was asking about.Yeah re: the cast I agree, that's why I said in my comment it was more subjective, but I don't see how the Medallion of Power, the tribe division, or the quit hurt the season to begin with. I've never understood where people are coming from on any of those to start with.Pfft like what

Cropping takes two secondsI knew it was just poor MS Paint skills.

Just click the little dots and drag the cursor and make the big box into a littler box and then you cropped a thing."Some Internet thing", specific. Then get MS Paint

Fun fact, I think you sent me the old version of MS Paint once and I still have and always use that exact same .exe, because I could never find it online.

Or maybe it was someone else. Idk.

(This anecdote also makes clear to anyone reading the comments that I know you and am not just someone being a dick about cropping.)A go-to example of this is [Waterfall being a Gen I move.](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/2/21/Waterfall_I.png) Starting in Gen II, Waterfall appears on a lot of Pokemon and is always an HM move, so I figured it was Gen II, but ever since I found out (from TCoD back in the day) that it's a Gen I move, that's been one of my favorite trivia facts. It's learned only by Goldeen and Seaking, but since there are tons of better Water types available before them, I and many others have never bothered using them in Gen I, so it's really hidden. (Goldeen/Seaking remain the only Pokemon who can learn it by level-up.)

With the Time Capsule, this means that you can get this obscure Water move on almost any of your Gen I Water types by sending them forward to G/S/C, using the HM, and bringing them back. It's just an inferior Surf in Gen I, but not *that* much inferior, so there's some mild novelty to choosing it.

More recently, I was stunned to find that [Psych Up is in Gen II.](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/6/65/Psych_Up_II.png) I figured it was Gen III, because you see it so much with Meditite/Medicham there, but you can teach it to Psyduck/Golduck, Drowzee/Hypno, Mewtwo, and Espeon by level-up (none of whom I ever used in Gen II)... as well as a whole bunch of Pokemon via one of the most obscure TMs in the entire series, obtainable only by trading an Abra or Kadabra forward from Gen I, who will then hold it. *(...and Mewtwo learns it at level 33, but Mewtwo is only available at level 70+ from R/B/Y trades, making it impossible to actually get a Mewtwo with Psych Up, since there are no Move Relearners. How odd! Maybe the only time any Pokemon has had a move in its learnset that it can't actually learn?)*You don't know what you're trading for with Wonder Trade.Yeah I agree on that. I was maybe being pedantic that technically he didn't know it was a Charmander but probably that was an irrelevant distinction to bother making so my b.Whoa. Looks like a prototype of the Mimic Circle. I'll have to sacrifice my Pikachu to try that when I next play through Yellow, neat find.I thought it was a funny jokeOoh that's another one! I was going to ask about later, but I couldn't think of any examples of it, but yeah, I've thought a bunch of times that Giga Drain is Gen I. I've tended to remember it was Gen II recently but only because I forgot so many times before.Whoa, Gen II for Lucky Egg? I thought it was Gen III, that's where I got mine. Which... yeah, massive stroke of luck. I had literally no idea it existed, but I got insanely lucky with a Chansey, and I still have it and it's virtually indispensable.

There are a few other weird ones in there for the forward trades. Like Machops just hold "Huge Brick" or something which can be traded for $1k, and Jigglypuffs hold the incredibly obscure Polkadot Bow, virtually identical to the Pink Bow that raises the power of Normal-type moves. And that's how you get the TM for Psych Up. A shame most Pokemon just hold Berries; it'd be neat if more of them had unique items.What is your least favorite song by your favorite music artist?This was funny. Maybe I should watch this show.I like "Harder Better Faster Stronger." Like everyone else on the planet does I guess. Who are some of your other favorite music artists?

It might be kind of fun to watch the premiere, then start the finale and see who's still there, then go back and watch the rest.ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT OKAY NOW LADIESAmong people who remembered Africa the consensus was generally that Teresa was amazing and should have been on All-Stars but would never be seen again.&gt;Do not reply to comments in ways that tacitly confirm spoilers. For example, replying to a post with "gee, sounds like someone has been reading the bootlist" can signify that whatever was being talked about is a spoiler, even though it is not said. If you have concerns about a post, message the moderators and use the "report" button and we will look into it.

THANK YOU for this. I once got spoiled by exactly this. Somebody commented on their predictions, and it looked maybe slightly sketchy but it could have just been someone half-assing their commentary so I really didn't think much of it... but then all the replies said "Wow, way to spoil" or whatever and then I can figure it's probably a spoiler.

If you're spoiled, then yeah, someone naming what'll happen looks pretty blatant... but to people who aren't, it's just another prediction, until you start commenting outright saying that it's not.I think it's more because those conversations often turn into people reacting to the boot list which can sometimes be a spoiler in itself.OP ain't callin' him a truther!oofWhy do you think that's the case for Nicaragua?Top 2/3 is too high for JuddRight before FTC. Decent chance of getting a good edit, almost certainly means you were a threat... and more prize money than any other place.Heh, I was planning to ask for responses in PMs but nobody has sent in any, so maybe this is harder than I thought, and I could remove the gold aspect and just see if people manage to get them at all?Okay now that was well playedI *FUCKING* LOVE HOUSE MANDERLY.

Fucking hell such FUCKING BADASSES. THE NORTH FUCKING REMEMBERS!!!!!!!!!!!!I would be honored... and am now wondering what my RES tag already is.I got goosebumps reading some of this. I'll have to read those other posts. Here's to vengeance, justice, pie, and blood!Written by Charlie Kelly to try and woo the Waitress.

It did not work.CroppingI don't get how splitting up the tribes by age went poorly at all. The divisions are kind of incidental and it gave us two tribes with lots of memorable dynamics that I found way entertaining. I also really don't get how the Medallion of Power can be an "enormous flop" when it was an afterthought in four episodes. That's like saying Vanuatu sucks because of Brady Finta.

Unlikable players is more subjective I guess? But even then I don't know who he'd really mean besides NaOnka.

I don't get why the double quit is so bad. What do you dislike about it? I thought it was a really satisfying, dramatic, unique episode. What about that hurts the season?

I agree that Nicaragua doesn't have a lot of "big moments" but I don't think it needs them; it just stays consistently fun and engaging a lot of the time.I meant out of the places in which you can get voted out, the ones the question was asking about.Yeah re: the cast I agree, that's why I said in my comment it was more subjective, but I don't see how the Medallion of Power, the tribe division, or the quit hurt the season to begin with. I've never understood where people are coming from on any of those to start with.Pfft like what

Cropping takes two secondsI knew it was just poor MS Paint skills.

Just click the little dots and drag the cursor and make the big box into a littler box and then you cropped a thing."Some Internet thing", specific. Then get MS Paint

Fun fact, I think you sent me the old version of MS Paint once and I still have and always use that exact same .exe, because I could never find it online.

Or maybe it was someone else. Idk.

(This anecdote also makes clear to anyone reading the comments that I know you and am not just someone being a dick about cropping.)A go-to example of this is [Waterfall being a Gen I move.](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/2/21/Waterfall_I.png) Starting in Gen II, Waterfall appears on a lot of Pokemon and is always an HM move, so I figured it was Gen II, but ever since I found out (from TCoD back in the day) that it's a Gen I move, that's been one of my favorite trivia facts. It's learned only by Goldeen and Seaking, but since there are tons of better Water types available before them, I and many others have never bothered using them in Gen I, so it's really hidden. (Goldeen/Seaking remain the only Pokemon who can learn it by level-up.)

With the Time Capsule, this means that you can get this obscure Water move on almost any of your Gen I Water types by sending them forward to G/S/C, using the HM, and bringing them back. It's just an inferior Surf in Gen I, but not *that* much inferior, so there's some mild novelty to choosing it.

More recently, I was stunned to find that [Psych Up is in Gen II.](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/6/65/Psych_Up_II.png) I figured it was Gen III, because you see it so much with Meditite/Medicham there, but you can teach it to Psyduck/Golduck, Drowzee/Hypno, Mewtwo, and Espeon by level-up (none of whom I ever used in Gen II)... as well as a whole bunch of Pokemon via one of the most obscure TMs in the entire series, obtainable only by trading an Abra or Kadabra forward from Gen I, who will then hold it. *(...and Mewtwo learns it at level 33, but Mewtwo is only available at level 70+ from R/B/Y trades, making it impossible to actually get a Mewtwo with Psych Up, since there are no Move Relearners. How odd! Maybe the only time any Pokemon has had a move in its learnset that it can't actually learn?)*You don't know what you're trading for with Wonder Trade.Yeah I agree on that. I was maybe being pedantic that technically he didn't know it was a Charmander but probably that was an irrelevant distinction to bother making so my b.Whoa. Looks like a prototype of the Mimic Circle. I'll have to sacrifice my Pikachu to try that when I next play through Yellow, neat find.I thought it was a funny jokeOoh that's another one! I was going to ask about later, but I couldn't think of any examples of it, but yeah, I've thought a bunch of times that Giga Drain is Gen I. I've tended to remember it was Gen II recently but only because I forgot so many times before.Whoa, Gen II for Lucky Egg? I thought it was Gen III, that's where I got mine. Which... yeah, massive stroke of luck. I had literally no idea it existed, but I got insanely lucky with a Chansey, and I still have it and it's virtually indispensable.

There are a few other weird ones in there for the forward trades. Like Machops just hold "Huge Brick" or something which can be traded for $1k, and Jigglypuffs hold the incredibly obscure Polkadot Bow, virtually identical to the Pink Bow that raises the power of Normal-type moves. And that's how you get the TM for Psych Up. A shame most Pokemon just hold Berries; it'd be neat if more of them had unique items.What is your least favorite song by your favorite music artist?This was funny. Maybe I should watch this show.I like "Harder Better Faster Stronger." Like everyone else on the planet does I guess. Who are some of your other favorite music artists?

What are some of your favorite TV shows?

Do you have any bad fears? Like spiders or something not deep existential shit like dying alone or whatever that shit's sadWhich means it's something that consistently interests people who haven't seen it before. What's wrong with that?Ooh, I didn't know there was one in Stadium 2. In that case Mewtwo can learn it! I wonder whether other legendaries or starters have early moves they can't get or whether it was just a weird oversight.Spencer receives more air time than KimmiTime to rewatch the series.Thank you!If that's why Ryscor made that mistake, I'm very surprised and impressed at someone figuring out that reason.Fuck yeah Rotu! Only one I've bought is Soliantu, which has the season of your left buff and color of your right.It's like Tyson's in Tocantins. They build up the obvious outcome, then insert the "obligatory" 2 seconds of fake "doubt" right before the Tribal Council where everyone will suddenly vote out the badass dominating alpha male (okay, as if...) - then *whatthefuckitactuallyhappened.* Those episodes nailed the combination between explanation and suspense.What's amazing is it's a mess even before and after that. That's the highlight for sure, but the whole freaking thing is amazing.

...And Purple Kelly is the only one they don't show answering a question. &lt;3I haven't watched the rest of his channel and don't really know who he is, but I really liked this video. His voice is calming.I know two Cake songs so that's something! \^_\^ I have a lot of favorites but have especially been on a Springsteen kick lately.

Courage has some good shit (returrrrrn the slaaab) and I especially love Breaking Bad because duh who doesn't. I'm probably going to start a rewatch soon with a friend who knows nothing about it which should be fucking amazing. Favorite Breaking Bad episodes or moments? :O

Ha that'd be an interesting hobby with that fear. I'd be scared of falling and I'm not even scared of heights really. How'd you get into rock climbing?

I've never encountered a cockroach but I feel you on bug fears in general. Centipedes n bees n spiders n shit.Probably gives me more of a TV presence than third boot or something, so if I had to go out early, at least I went out the very earliest. I'd rather go far, obviously, but if I'm on the bottom of my tribe, at least I can have an extreme placement in a more highly viewed episode.Me too, so I emailed them directly, and they just replied with "Duck season!"I thought the edit did a really, really poor job of explaining how/why he won over Woo. It came across like he was an annoying, paranoid, unnecessarily cutthroat trainwreck who got jury votes just for "Making Big Moves" in spite of being hated by everyone. They didn't build up his "social game" of being a popular, hard worker around camp at all. I also got tired of all the Hidden Immunity Idols and I'd have a bit of a hard time stomaching his nauseatingly valueless gameplay even if it had been presented better.Yup absolutely, that edit was waaay misleading in a way that makes her look a lot worse. That's fun that you're just now getting through them in order!

So was Danny"I will never write your name down again. I swear." Please let Savage be the one jury vote that prevents Spencer from winning if Spencer makes the end &lt;3Savage has become Rupert on like every level. How does anyone not love him??When he broke down crying about how she's his world because he couldn't stand to be apart from her as everyone on the tribe got emotional? I think the only people to whom those things were the focus of the story were (some of) the viewers.So Savage is like totally fucked with this edit yeah?Oh my god, I just realized. Stephen is Gale Boetticher.Did Tasha just say whomever and have it subtitled as whoever?PLEASE let this be like the Cagayan merge where halfway through Kass suddenly hates someone and takes them out &lt;3Point Blank is a great Springsteen songIs Tasha srsly berating Kass for believing her

It would have been nice to see Kass bring Chaos out a week earlier and vote out Spencer.Not really, no. She brought Chaos into the picture just too late for it to actually matter when we were *thiiiiiiis* close to a glorious episode of Kass and Savage voting out Spencer over Woo, aka the best thing that ever could have happened on this season.You're goddamn right.True, though now all that would have changed is earlier cuts for Kass, Tasha, Trish, and probably Sarah, so.. you're welcome I guess!In a row, so the last one. Kass and Andrew Savage voting out Spencer over Woo... I can't imagine anything better. Unless Kimmi were also there.Rupert is fucking magical how is this account realTo be fair, they *can* change things on the spot, like dates and challenges. Not saying that's what they did here but there is a video of the Gabon F10 challenge painted as an individual one, so we know they were originally going to merge and not swap. Not everything is pre-set.Okay that Chunks part was freaking adorableMy first thought. Great song, clear pick for this.zornHahaha holy fuck thank you. I was so absorbed in Andrew Savage doing Andrew Savage things that I didn't even notice this. That's beautiful.Galeotalanzawow gee thanks wowIt's a bad, petty attitude to want basically my two favorite contestants of the season to vote my least favorite?

Over another one of my favorites, whom he berated as a "lapdog" in one of my least favorite Survivor moments ever?How is it any more matter-of-fact for me to say that than it is for you to say "It wouldn't have been glorious or the best thing to happen" or that moments "aren't" as bad?Why do you think he should be especially focused on emulating Tony?I think it's part of the legendary-ness. I hope so, at least, because I love Koror being the only brown tribe. Makes Palau that much more iconic and legendary.It wasn't at all, actually, but now you have me wishing I could emulate Andrew Savage's voice in real life.Not every season needs to have a concrete "hero" or "villain." I don't think Savage is one at all just because he was on the wrong side of one vote by an underdog.I like both of them in both seasons.I feel like it was a lot more character-driven, too. But then again my favorite part of HvV is the Sandra vs Russell story that was only starting by this point in that season, so who knows what Cambodia might bring later on.But it has Andrew Savage"Lill ain't here so idc" is my view of most seasons reallyHells yeahThat would help make up for "Savage/Kass blindside Spencer over Woo" not being a thing.Yup, absolutely, and that's what makes Survivor fascinating and emotional. Things like that breakdown are more evocative and give us more to think about than a "Great game move!" pat on the back.Hooray! Happy someone else is, and I look forward to seeing any guesses you have!Edna wasn't happy getting those places. She was at the bottom and wouldn't have won any jury vote, but that wasn't apathy; she just didn't realize it until it was too late. In her boot episode we saw how upset she was about being on the bottom.It adds balance. It's 0 effort to throw in a weekly confessional, let alone an occasional one, from anyone, even if they aren't the most interesting confessionalist - just look at Vanuatu. Chad and Leann weren't too interesting speakers, but they each got at least one confessional almost *every week* and it certainly didn't drag down the quality of the season; it raised it, because we at least got to know whether they were interesting, lots of people ended up liking one or both of them, and it didn't take away any necessary time from other people.

Nobody's even asking for Kelly to get weekly confessionals; hell, the person you're replied to didn't even ask for multiple. But showing *nothing* from someone, even if that someone isn't interesting.. there's no reason to it and all it does is wholly prevent the audience from getting at all interested in one of the contestants' stories. It's lame at the best of times; in a season like this, where the entire thing was "Vote for who *you* want to see back! Vote for *your* favorites!", not getting to actually see our favorites is outright shitty. I'm remaining optimistic that we'll get more Kelly/Kimmi/Keith as the season goes on, but if we don't, it's really disappointing that the season went "Vote for whoever you want to see again from seasons past! ...Oh, you picked them? Well, *we* don't really want to see them, so we're going to take away absolutely all of their content and give it all to Spencer.""And suddenly Gollum's cock was out, jutting upward from his breeches like a fat pink mast."I bet it was that Chip Skylark dude. He always seemed really proud of how white his teeth were...Someone referenced this on Survivor once. They get messages about challenges from a container in a nearby tree cheesily/playfully called their "Tree Mail", and in an episode filmed in June 2003, the guy who goes to grab the message is mumbling "Tree Mail, Tree Mail, what what, the Tree Mail" in a gravelly voice."all up on" and *especially* "jibblies." I'm sure there are waaaaay more but I can't think of them offhand. I guess they're just that deep into my lexicon.He hasn't killed Lord Too-Fat-To-Sit-A-Horse!Haha, joke's on him! Mine's already... dead... oh. [:(](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7erl9k01C2M)Lyanna died over a decade before the series startedWhat do you mean by "this late"? For another 7-book series, Umbridge was introduced 5 books into Harry Potter and is widely considered one of the absolute best and most memorable characters in that series. If Young Griff makes it to Dream, he's been in as many books as Robb, Catelyn, Joffrey, or any of the other major characters who died in Storm - and that's not even factoring in that with the way Feast/Dance were split up, chronologically it may as well have been book 4 of a 6-book series.

It isn't late at all; it's just the latest thing we've had yet.This is beautiful.It's amazing, thank you for sharing it.I think the green looks nicer. It's calming somehow.Probably a little of both.I feel like /u/shutupredneckman2 would like this fact, especially more than the other one about minorities.&gt;This happens every fucking season. Let's start hating Mike because he's getting a winner's edit. Let's hate Cochran because he made it look easy. Let's hate Spencer because he's getting a winner's edit.

That's three seasons, not every season. And that's three seasons in which the winners got massive amounts of air time that made their wins incredibly predictable and shut out potentially interesting content from others. Also, I think you're wrong in assuming that anyone hates Mike, Cochran, and Spencer *as people* as a result of their edits, but as TV characters, it gets tiring to see them overexposed past the point a viewer considers interesting or thinks increases the quality of the season.

Nobody's "acting as if nobody has gotten a winner's edit" before: every winner get's the edit of a winner by definition, and a lot of their edits aren't like that. But if by "winner's edit" you mean the overbearing CPP4 edits every week, I'm not sure how you can say people are acting like it's never happened before then list examples of how it's a thing people dislike every time it happens.

It seems to me like you don't mind one type of storytelling that other people do mind, which seems like a simple difference in opinion on what makes Survivor enjoyable that doesn't really warrant an angry mini-rant like that so much as just agreeing to disagree about what's fun to see on the show. I don't know why you think your personal preference about edits is somehow superior to other people's.

&gt;So what if he gets 7 confessionals and Kimmi gets none?

When someone enjoys watching Kimmi, voted for her to get back on, were pleasantly shocked when she made it, and don't enjoy watching Spencer, didn't vote for him to get back on, and were disappointed (but probably not shocked) when he made it on, I think the answer to this question is pretty obvious. I'm remaining optimistic that Kelly, Kimmi, and Keith will get more air time later on just because I think it'd be really lame for the producers to say "Vote back WHOEVER YOU WANT TO SEE!" then just force-feed us whoever they want us to see, but if that is the latter is the way the season goes, then yeah, the season is a disappointment and it feels like the "voting for our favorites" thing was kind of a dishonest waste because they're just going to show the same couple people they would have brought back anyway.

&gt;I feel like the superfans just want to have the opposite opinion of a casual fan. They see that the FB page and edit is filled with Spencer love, so they come to this subreddit and try to prove their super fandom with an opinion that contradicts the casuals.

This is absolutely absurd. People can disagree with you without going out of their way to hold some contrary opinion or whatever, and if you have this hard a time wrapping your mind around the concept of people not liking the same television seasons and contestants as you do, that's on you.

&gt;You act as if you don't know the point of Survivor; to tell a story.

Alright, I was going to keep replying to the rest of your post but now it's getting so condescending that I don't really see a point.

&gt;Am I out of line? You know I love you guys, right?

Yes and no respectively.&gt;Let's enjoy the confessionals they find relevant enough to show us, and then let's all get our own opinion

Telling people that they should enjoy every second of air time on the show is the exact opposite of people forming their own opinions.You don't have to be doing Edgic or individually counting confessionals to notice that some of your favorites aren't getting shown as much as someone who was just on the show with an incredibly similar edit three seasons ago, and obviously that is going to frustrate some people. And if people do get into Edgic or confessional counts or whatever, that's just because that's what entertains them. It's not right or wrong to do that or not to do that. This kind of reminds me how in the Pokemon fanbase, people who don't get into competitive battling (like I don't) sometimes tell people who do "Why don't you just have fun???" - people are doing what's fun for them. I would be very surprised if anyone on this subreddit watches the show for any other reason than entertainment, but that doesn't mean they're all going to be entertained by Survivor all the time.People can like the show and be a fan of Survivor while not liking and being a fan of every part of every season. I don't think anyone "wants to be negative", but that does not mean every storyline or choice by production is going to resonate positively with all or even most viewers.Yeah and meanwhile I fucking love Jeff Varner but I also enjoy Tasha. But when someone doesn't enjoy Tasha I just think "Oh, I guess she didn't click with them like she did for me, or she clashed with them as a viewer in a way they didn't for me." I don't try to ferret out these weird hidden biases and conspiracies about people's opinions; I just recognize that between tens of thousands of fans on the Internet, some of them are probably going to like and dislike different contestants.&gt;You hyperbolic ass

Well, welcome to...

Neckman's WorldI missed the gift, the ship, and the cook's name but got the others. I want to go on this show with this category now.Whoa, JLew and Mike are still in?

I can accept the Jaclyn cut now.Oh hey. Thanks. I wish I were still reading this.67%I did some last-minute face paint which scared a trick-or-treater. I gave candies to the childrens. I love Halloween always.Careful. Talk like that and it sounds like you *want* to get punched in the face.Looking at eBay I see the price of one set is $8, actually - although there don't seem to be many out there at all (probably just no demand for them til now since people don't know they're a thing) so that could be quite a bargain for someone who wants to grab them up. (I haven't ever seen Space Jam.)Savage is fantastic and at the rate he's going will probably be my favorite of the season, him or Jeff. He's likable in a bunch of ways but also overconfident and melodramatic in a wicked entertaining Rupert Boneham sort of way. And I went into this season thinking and fearing that he'd be boring as hell.Rupert was just like that in Pearl Islands, though. I mean he basically tried to murder Jon for voting for him.Africa for the mindfuckery and killing the Mallrats but outside of that, I think Marq's was absolutely fantastic. It poisoned the Love Tribe and set in motion the first major power shift in Survivor history - redefining the entire game - and unbelievable endgame, where without it we probably would have gotten a season where La Mina has the dominance of Koror and then Tammy wins.I've never seen a basketball game in my life so it would probably not appeal to me anyway.^^^^^...same:(Honest question: How are [Boo, Cassandra, Edgardo, Michelle, Mookie, Rocky, and Stacy](/spoiler) super compelling?I'd be interested in hearing your reasons for these. Some of them I can figure (Rock types for Ciera lol, most of Joe's, Keith having ball ones, foxes and dragons for Abi, vegetables for Kimmmi lol &lt;3) but I'd be interested in the others.One critique I have is personally I don't like having the colors change in a thread about a certain season. I think it makes the sub feel a little more chaotic, and just changing the season logo at the top while keeping the purple layout would be better (though maybe I'm just biased because I love the purple layout &lt;3). Otherwise I dig all these changes! And maybe other people like that more than I do, but for me personally seeing *such* an overhaul thread-to-thread feels a bit odd.Entirely different cast every time keeps each season engaging and entertaining in a fresh way.Africa hasn't been thought of as the weakest season since about two seasons after Africa.Rupert is such a fucking god.\*eagle screeches\*

God bless Coach WadeMy favorites are S1 Borneo, S4 Marquesas, and S7 Pearl Islands, followed by S3 Africa, S10 Palau, and S17 Gabon. It kind of depends on what you'd be interested in from the show, though. Africa and S28 Cagayan appeal to different people for very different reasons.I guess I just see that out of him in every season; in HvV it just might take the form of different words because of the specific tribe divisions. But I also love him in every season because I think he's wildly entertaining and dramatic any time he does anything, so I never minded.God bless Rupert Boneham. He is a national treasure.You get that a bunch in big threads, though, especially on AskReddit but even on here. People see someone asking a question and the "reply" button is above all the replies that are already there, so they respond before seeing if anyone else did (and if the replies came at the same time, the earlier responses may not have even been on the page for them.)I've gotten multiple skeptics into the show.Nah I meant that as a comparison. If you take away their epic implosion, they're basically a marginally more colorful La Mina, only this time they succeed.Nothing. I don't *despise* anything about most reasons, really. Only alterations I'd make to Marq would be to maybe make a few of the supporting Rotus a little bigger characters. And I guess in theory Patricia could be replaced with someone more interesting who's also a guaranteed second boot. But I am really happy with everything about how Marquesas played out and everything that basically every contestant brought.Nah. I meant that without Rotu's implosion their dynamics would be similarly bland to La Mina's.Actually looking at it again, I think maybe my problem is less that the colors change and more that they're a solid fill. Like looking at [Fiji](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/3rwftl/just_started_watching_fiji_and/) it's pure red, [SoPa](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/3rwrog/south_pacific_worlds_apart_except_for/) is pure green, while Cambodia has the sexy purple gradient. If other ones had a gradient it might look a little more seamless, if that's possible to implement.~~Really? NuRaro has Vecepia surfacing as a winner and everything involving Sean/Rob/John.~~ I'm a dummyHahaha oops. Okay, *that* one was just me fucking up after my 8-hour work shift. My b.Almost word for word the comment I was going to post til I saw this at the top of the thread ("This show needs a Neleh return so badly.") Neleh for HvV2 please &lt;3Cute payoffs are like my favorite thing. I'm a sucker for cuteness, puns, and the holiday season, so I really like this one.Oh heyy I'm a major Springsteen fan and just listened through Wild/Innocent for the first time like three days ago. It was the last of his 18 studio albums I still hadn't heard (I saved it for last at the end so I wouldn't be finishing with, like, Lucky Town or whatever.)Is it really "vs." if it's just [Kass tweeting at her a bunch of times](http://i.imgur.com/91sn32Q.jpg)? It seems one-sided.I did actually listen to Wild/Innocent a while back when I was only semi-into him and didn't really know what I was doing, and NYC Serenade is the one song I kept. So that one has been a big favorite of mine over the last year or so in particular, and I only just got around to listening to it - again, intentionally pushing it past a few of the others.

I definitely don't mind the 90s stuff either, honestly. We Shall Overcome is the one Springsteen album I just don't enjoy at all, but that's not because it's bad - just far from my own taste - and even it had a few songs I liked. Devils &amp; Dust did nothing for me either way. Other than that, I like it all (but clearly, having "Rosalita" be the last song off an old studio album I hear for effectively the first time is a stronger finish than, like, "Real Man", haha.) So I'm definitely going to give it a few listens - already have for a few of the songs, even - because it definitely made a strong... not first impression, but my first impression now as opposed to a few years ago. NYC Serenade is already an all-time favorite since I randomly kept it for whatever reason, and I see Rosalita, Kitty's Back, and your username also climbing way up there.I need to listen through more of Tom Joad, I love the title track and Youngstown so I need to work through the others more and see if there are more hidden gems or if they really are just kind of a mass of general Ghost Of Tom Joadiness. D&amp;D I'll do the same with, but I've been listening to a looooot of Springsteen for the past month and a half, like even by my standards - I have listened to almost nothing else for a straight month and a half, haha, and sitting through Tom Joad/D&amp;D were kind of killing the momentum. So I'll go back to Tom Joad first then D&amp;D; popular opinion seems to be that D&amp;D was stronger but I think I enjoyed Tom Joad more.

I think High Hopes is underrated, honestly - yeah it's a total hodgepodge so I get that that detracts from it as an album, when it's just all these pieces thrown together, but I think all those individual pieces work really well. Harry's Place is a random favorite of mine, I like that album's version of American Skin, *love* the new rendition of Tom Joad, love the Dream Baby Dream cover, This Is Your Sword and Invisible Game definitely work for me... maybe the weakest opening/title track on any of his albums but I think the overall album, yeah as an album it's weird but the individual songs click for me more than they apparently did for others.

Haven't done live albums yet! First priority was getting through the studio ones and I think my next focus will be more on unreleased bootleg stuff and Tracks (though I do have 18 Tracks; it and Working On A Dream were my first Springsteen albums. Pretty weird pair to start off on but apparently it worked for me!)Yeah I'm not big on this one, but that could also be because I have no idea who John Cena is.Reminds me of when Ross says "vulva" on Friends.I swear there used to be, before High Hopes, a ranking on that same site where every single song got a write-up. I liked that one more (though no ranking of all his songs would really appeal to me) since I could read about all of them. Or maybe I'm thinking of a different list.I hope we can vote Erin Cebula onto the next fan voting season.caryn_groedel_gasp.mp3These continue to be amazing! Klefki especially looks right out of a Gen II game!You're quite welcome!Hot damn, yo, this had me thinking I want one but a glance at Amazon shows these listed for 85 bucks or more. Nice find, that's way cool.I own a "LORD HELIX" pin that someone made when Twitch Plays Pokemon was in its heyday.

But as far as official merchandise goes, the rarest things I have are Pokemon Box and various limited edition handheld consoles, particularly the [Latias/Latios GBA.](http://pocketmedia.ign.com/pocket/image/NewGBApokemon_sys2_.jpg) I have a few other Pokemon handheld consoles that are probably a little rarer than Box, but the Latias/Latios GBA is my favorite and was the hardest and costliest to come by.

**edit** for [picture of handhelds.](http://i.imgur.com/kiNYBt3.jpg)I've always liked Goodra but you raise some interesting points here.Gotta give 'em props for [keeping the account active even after this.](https://twitter.com/breadrollsson)I think "chicken for you" was a funnier comment than "a chicken for you" personally

Either one works, maybe mix it up with both just to make things that much craziershh :(I see only one listing on eBay and there it went for $50.I loved Val, one of my favorite early boots of all-time and especially of recent years. She was an interesting player and excellent narrator. Really easy to root for and I wonder how differently things could have gone for her if she hadn't been stuck on Exile for 3 days. If Jeremy can get his Second Chance, maybe Val can get hers some day. &lt;3Yay useless trivia! I love these. I'm happy Savage passed Darrah. Thanks for the post.I want to see! And then I'll probably want one...&gt;8 of 941

lolAlbert H'gharI hear that people who starve on Survivor then compete on this show explode into rock 'n' roll bands.NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOI put The Promise in there before Devils because I already knew half of it and wanted to break up the folk a bit (since I also did Tom Joad right before Overcome.) So I've already done The Promise, Tracks will be a massive freaking undertaking on its own but at least I already know a little under 25% of it.

Haha, it's funny that your first was also Working on a Dream, because I recently saw a grumpy fan elsewhere saying "Guys, how can we stop people from buying Working on a Dream? Some people might hear it before anything else and think that's what Springsteen is like!" And now I see both you and me starting with it. If anything I think it's good as an introductory album - I mean, not the one I'd pick for someone now because everyone needs to hear BTR, but it's agreeable while not being outstanding. It worked for my position at least. I'd rank it relatively low now but definitely not bad.

I'll be sure to check out that version because I'm honestly not too big on Freeze-Out despite outright worshiping literally every other second of that album, and I've seen versions of it of that length and have no idea how that's possible for that song. So I'll make a mental note of that one. I know my brother really freaking loves Hammersmith. 75-85 I've heard good things about, and I know my library has NYC. Unplugged one of 90s stuff definitely sounds interesting, especially since I'm already fine with the 90s music to begin with (other than 57 Channels. Booooo 57 Channels.)

I'll make Tracks my next big undertaking, and then I'll probably go back and forth between bootlegs and live stuff, since I've heard great stuff about some of the live stuff and am intrigued by the Unplugged one but am also really interested in the bootlegs and unreleased stuff. Actually with the sheer size of Tracks, odds are I'll go through it bit by bit and do live/bootleg stuff mixed together in the meantime.jesus fucking christ why would people do this.

I've never touched a gun and I've barely ever seen any, and I don't really know the first thing about them other than, like, you hold them and fire them and it shoots stuff. But fucking hell that's more than enough to know that that is like the worst idea on the planet. I'm happy he didn't accidentally kill you.I think he's way more interesting and he feels like a much more defining part of Pearl Islands, so it's just neat to see him further on that list I guess.I like when Sabrina broke down crying about how she never knew Sprint could be so good to her.I like it!You're goddamn right.I love when I realize I didn't reply to something like a month ago and feel obligated to reply but think it'd be weird to bump it. Have you seen more since then? Those are mostly strong seasons but there are some great ones you're missing as well.

I don't think PG will return since Probst didn't seem to be a huge fan either. :/ But it could happen!Yess, Marquesas is great! One of my favorites alongside 1 and 7. I'd also really strongly recommend 9 and 10. What(/who) are your favorites from what you've seen?

I'm not the biggest PG fan but she's a dynamic enough casting choice with enough fans that I'd be fine with seeing her again. But I'm not crazy about her or China in general.Nice quiz! I gave up because I was sure I'd gone through everyone from Philippines (trying to think through the post-merge people and challenges rather than cheating by just going through each tribe in my head), and it turns out I forgot Jonathan. d'oh. Got the others though.Yeah Salazar is barely a character, I don't think we know enough to justify how he ended up founding the school with those other four at all, and he contributes to that problem. I'd probably have cut him soon.Charlie worked with dragons in Romania.

...And that's all we have for Charlie.

With a family that size it makes sense that there'd be one we don't know, and having another Weasley is a good way to tell us about wizards abroad that aren't really connected to our own, so I'm happy he's in the series but the entire point of him is that you really can't care about him, so. Good cut. Was on my radar for the near future.Totally with you on this, I'm honestly not sure if she should have even made it this high even if the Dumbles backstory is awesome just because she's a fairly small part of it.

Her name makes me think of Kingdra so that's something.I'm not sure what that has to do with the OP. Where is PS71 saying women have it worse than gay men? They're just saying different people have different but similar struggles. I am not sure what's wrong about supporting those whose battles are different than your own.Are you suggesting that gay men can't/shouldn't care about women's issues?This comment seems to assume that only women can be feminists.#\*LIP-SMACKING INTENSIFIES\*I had a really weird experience reading Catcher in the Rye for the first time in high school. Like, weirdest experience I've ever had with a book. You ever do that thing where you're reading a book and you accidentally skip a pair of pages? You turn two instead of one. But then you see that what you've just started reading doesn't follow from what you just read, so you realize your fingers slipped or the pages stuck, you turn back and it's no big deal, resolved in a second or two.

Well that happened to me early on in Catcher... only without the realization. And I skipped the most important passage of the entire book.

One pair of pages early on ends with Holden sitting down to write an English assignment for someone, about a glove. The page ends with something like "I sat down and got to work writing." Well I flipped the page, and apparently I flipped 2 instead of 1, skipping a pair. Totally basic slip of the fingers - only this time, I didn't realize it, because the next page was the start of a new chapter. Next chapter opened with a scene about the assignment he wrote, so the previous page's end, about sitting down to write, seemed like a decent end, and I kept reading, none the wiser.

...Well, it turns out that on that pair of pages I accidentally skipped, Holden reflects in great detail on his little brother getting sick and dying... which, if you've read the book, you know informs his character in major ways throughout the whole story. It's probably the most crucial passage to understanding anything about how Holden's mind works. **Basically his entire character is built upon that backstory, and I didn't read it.**

Now here's where it gets even better: **the cause of his brother's death is never stated again for the entire rest of the book. But there are *references* to the death**;  Holden just doesn't think about it in-depth again - he doesn't even think about the fact that his little bro got sick - because it's such a hard topic for him.  So here I am wondering "Whoa, how did Holden's brother die? When are we gonna find *that* out?" ...when it was already revealed like 40 pages into the fucking book; I just flipped past it like an idiot and didn't realize.

And oh yeah, the very first time Holden thinks about his brother after the backstory is given? The very first time it's referenced again, it's via something like "When my brother died, **like I told you about earlier...**" - it has *a specific reference to Holden having already told us about the death, something I had no idea actually happened.* And our teacher had told us before we started the book, "Holden is an unreliable narrator; not everything he thinks about is exactly what happened, so don't take his words at face value." So here I am, thinking, "Holy fuck, I get what she was talking about now! Holden doesn't even remember what parts of the story he's already told? Man, what a great way to introduce the backstory - and I guess Holden's even more unstable than I thought!"

So basically, I got the idea that Holden's brother - who died of a simple illness - had died from something *so* awful and *so* exceptionally traumatic that it just nuked Holden's psyche. I mean, if I had been right, if Holden *hadn't* talked about his brother's death the way he later explicitly reminded us he had? Then clearly it must have been something massive... so naturally, I wanted to know what the heck it was. **I wanted to know so badly that I kept reading the entire book nonstop for hours**... which meant that **I finished it the day I started it - before I could go back to class the next day and hear my teacher discussing the backstory.** If I hadn't read through the whole book that day and had stuck with the assigned chapters, I'd have gone to class the next day, the teacher would have said "Okay, so let's talk about Allie's death", I'd be all "Wha?" and realize I'd missed a section, no big deal.

But nope. I read the whole damn thing in a day, just couldn't stop, because I was waiting and waiting for the epic plot twist of "HOW DID ALLIE CAULFIELD DIE?", something that was already revealed like 40 pages in and never explained again. But obviously, I had my own personal theory near the end of the book - and this is where it gets a little weird but I swear to God this is what I believed. Near the end Holden goes to see his sister, but he's not supposed to be there, and she says "Daddy's going to *kill* you!" She says that sentence, those exact words, like three times, and "kill" is italicized the first time she says it.

...so naturally **my jaw dropped as I assumed we'd just discovered that ALLIE CAULFIELD WAS MURDERED BY HIS PARENTS.** When it was a fucking basic disease. But it made perfect sense to me: We never *see* Holden's parents, he doesn't seem to care much about them, he has all these major issues with trust and authority... and Allie died in some fucked-up way that Holden can't even discuss with us yet thinks he's already told us, and now here the sister is with constant references to Daddy *killing* Holden... It all added up! Holden's dad killed his brother!! What an awesome plot twist!!!

So naturally I went full steam ahead waiting for the official reveal... and I got to the climax of the book... and then things calmed down afterwards... and I started to think it wouldn't be revealed... and then it ended, just like that. Thought to myself "WHAT THE FUCK? That was the weakest shit ever! They never told us how it happened!" So I Googled "how did allie die" to see people's theories, saw every page mentioning the illness with 0 talk of it being a mystery... and gradually realized my mistake.

Made for a pretty fucking entertaining story to tell my teacher the next day.

So yeah, if you're ever reading Catcher in the Rye again? After the passage where Holden thinks about Allie's sickness as he writes the glove assignment, just imagine that that wasn't there. And then imagine how much that would completely freaking uproot the story and change the entire tone of the story from there on.

**TL;DR: Accidentally skipped crucial backstory about Holden's brother; ended up thinking Holden had amnesia or schizophrenia or some shit as a result of his father murdering his brother; spent an entire day burning through the book waiting for an epic, shocking plot twist of dramatic murder that didn't exist.**

Good book, though.Woot woot! Africa's one of my favorites. My 4th favorite past those three of 1/4/7 I already named. The location is amazing and really sets it apart from other seasons, and it has fun enough dynamics and contestants to definitely make it consistently engaging, too. But I'm especially a sucker for that location. Philippines wasn't as great for me on the rewatch as live but it's still a fun season in my top half for sure. Everything about Matsing was amazing. Russell, Lisa, Denise were all great.

I'm definitely with you as far as saving returning player seasons for later, HvV especially since there are so many explicit references to previous season. But hey, that's just even more that you'll enjoy it now!I KNOW. Oh my gosh, I was so crushed it took a while to get over. I choose to believe they'll bring her back on their own in the near future, because, like... T-Bird! She's so amazing and adorable!It's comments like these that make me want children. This and on /r/CrazyIdeas where someone said to separately introduce your kids to Lennon, McCartney, Starr, and Harrison so their eventual discovery of The Beatles will blow their mind.Aah, nice! I want this so badly. It's my last big Holy Grail as far as Pokemon consoles are concerned after getting most of the handhelds I want. Great find.Just read the Wikipedia page for Grant Mattos.Feminazi Shirin vs. menTotally with you. I really, really hope they bring her back, it'll be so crushing that the fans didn't vote her back in if we don't see her again.Heh, I voted for all of them. But I'd definitely have her before Monica or Abi if I had to choose, and I also really wish she'd made it in over Tasha or Kelley out of the 10 we got.

Awesome! It goes uphill even more from there, and I'm happy to hear you're enjoying it already. My opinion on Rob varies by season but I think he's wicked entertaining there without a doubt.I think the twist was to ensure Darrah wouldn't win, even if it wasn't necessary. As we saw, she wouldn't have won anyway (with that challenge and that point in time), but I think they were just guaranteeing she wouldn't. I can't believe that a challenge no player can win coming up right when someone so bad at talking to the camera was on an Immunity streak is a coincidence.I dig it.Haha, thank you! I'm happy people are as entertained by this weird reading experience as I was. I love how darn *improbable* it all was, how every single piece lines up for me to view it that way, like a perfect storm. I remember Holden wondering where the ducks go during winter; apparently, during perfect storms of misinterpretation, they seek refuge in a faraway land where Allie was killed by his father.My English teacher was Frank GarrisonIt wouldn't really spoil much after you get like 50 pages in (whenever he writes about a glove) - only that he interacts with a certain character near the end - but it would probably be more entertaining after you've read the book.I thought of Allie Pohevitz when I Googled to remember the brother's name, if that counts. (Maybe they're the same person for all I know with the pages I skipped.)Haha, I had a similar thing with To Kill A Mockingbird. Going into the book I knew it was about racism, so for like a third of the book or so, I figured Scout/Jem/Atticu were black and I still picture them that way. At one point in class asked "Wait... Scout's white?" and the teacher thought I was joking. (Fortunately not the same teacher. No one teacher had to bear witness to both mistakes.) But that's definitely a little more outlandish with Holden.Funnily enough, CrystalFissure is actually from the Spyro the Dragon fanbase, not the Survivor one. I've been leading a double life...&gt;(I will also be very, very surprised if they ever bring him back for that reason.)

lol

Jeff Varner &lt;33 I'm so sorry I called him a douche.

I feel like you had to DIG DEEP to find that comment, John Rocker.I am so down with that name.I was going to make a joke about needing to escape Cochran and Spencer threads, then I go there aaand the very most recent thread is straight-up "Why is Cochran so hated?" I choose to blame you for that.That show's still on?&gt;Vytas got booted because he was on the wrong side of a pregame alliance but they gave him some bullshit creeper edit.

I just realized what great justice this is for him making it out of Galang on the *right* side of a pregame alliance but getting some bullshit savvy manipulator (of Silly Emotional Wimminz!) edit.And for me I grew up on the Internet, with a NeoPets account at age 5 and some god-awful Proboards forum about Pokemon at age 9. It is interesting when I think about the fact that I've never known a world without the Internet and wondering how much different my perspective would be if I did (and then that typically leads to me appreciating/having my mind blown by what a freaking wonder the Internet is. Like I doubt I'll ever meet any of the people who voted or commented on this post but now thanks to this, I can share this story with them across thousands of miles and they can respond to it instantly; same goes for any other thread on Reddit or anywhere. It's absolutely awe-inspiring that human beings created that, and I try to not take it for granted. Which I guess is a bit of a tangent but oh well.)He withered away into nothing after Shirin unfollowed him on Twitter.Spoiler: There is no filicide. (Apparently.)How dare a baby fail to defend himself against the most powerful Dark Wizard of all time!Similarly I didn't realize Lupin/Tonks died until the end, after the battle, where they list everyone who's dead and the "fifty others." Although they died off-page anyway so I guess it wasn't that big a difference.We should start a support group.Okay Joel MaddenAnd all I *needed* was the bad pussy.It's probably kind of a backlash against people who think everything he says is right and "cool." There are lots of whiny teenagers who see him as a role model, which *is* wrong (probably my favorite part of the book was when, in conjunction with a piano performance or something, he talks about how people always stupidly applaud for the wrong things, which is basically pre-emptively slamming his own fanbase.) So the natural response for lots of people is to swing to "No he's not! He's just a whiny teenager!" when really he's more complex than either of those - definitely not a role model but flawed for legit reasons.I'm a fan of WOAD but it's definitely one of his lesser ones, just since everything else is so good. Outlaw Pete is great but it's kind of weird structurally to put it at the beginning. I agree that The Wrestler is one of the best songs off the album; I might prefer The Last Carnival or ~~Surprise, Surprise~~ My Lucky Day, but it's definitely up there.Just for that comment I will.

Since there seems to be limited interest even out of the relatively few subscribers maybe I will switch this and have it not be a gold thing but just a "Hey, how many of these can you figure out?" thing for fun rather than competitive.I don't think he assumed Lill would stick with them at all. I haven't watched PI in a few years so I could be wrong, but iirc he seemed pretty defeated when the merge hit and couldn't do more than ask her if she'd let him know what her decision was. I mean he certainly hoped that she'd vote with them, but I don't think he ever really expected it.I think that's less being delusional and unaware of himself and more unaware of Ciera. Which is still his fault and just as bad - maybe even worse? - from a gameplay perspective, but I don't think I'd say he lacked self-awareness. He lacked Ciera-awareness and misread her.Whoa now don't be talkin' shit on Gabon and SJDS. :(Ser fucking Soldier.

ASOS Arya XII:

&gt;And there was one girl who took to following her, the village elder's daughter. She was of an age with Arya, but just a child; she cried if she skinned a knee, and carried a stupid cloth doll with her everywhere she went. The doll was made up to look like a man-at-arms, sort of, so the girl called him Ser Soldier and bragged how he kept her safe. "Go away," Arya told her half a hundred times. "Just leave me be." She wouldn't, though, so finally Arya took the doll away from her, ripped it open, and pulled the rag stuffing out of its belly with a finger. "Now he really looks like a soldier!" she said, before she threw the doll in a brook. After that the girl stopped pestering her, and Arya spent her days grooming Craven and Stranger or walking in the woods. Sometimes she would find a stick and practice her needlework, but then she would remember what had happened at the Twins and smash it against a tree until it broke.

... :(

Putting Arya next to an ordinary child, juxtaposing her with another girl who hasn't gone through all these things, who still has the innocence and childhood that have been ripped away from Arya - "of an age with Arya, but just a child" - reaaally shows how traumatic Arya's experiences have been in a way that feels too real to me. Ugh. I guess the part about her breaking a stick isn't tied directly to Ser Soldier but it's brutal for the same reasons so I kept it there.

(Also doesn't help that I have and love a bunch of stuffed animals, I'm way attached to all my adorable little stuffies, so that makes that image even more upsetting for me. But mostly the Arya trauma is utterly crushing.)What gets me here is that something like the Red Wedding, that's awful, but very clearly a tragic moment in a fictional narrative. With something like [your favorite Gregor Clegane moment here] - things like that absolutely happen in the real world and I don't mean to say otherwise, but here, the frequency and degree of them, things happening *that* bad *that* often, it's in part a product of the Westerosi society that's very different from my own, so it's a little easier to disconnect from it.

But this isn't anything like that. It's not something that screams "dramatic narrative!", it's not because of war or the feudal society. It's just a good man slipping away from and losing his sense of the world. More natural but that makes it feel more... pointless, there's no cause for it and nobody to blame, so it's not enraging, it doesn't make me want justice; it's just sad in a very straightforward way. Just.. "This is what happens to people eventually." No reason, no significance, just time. And then the execution with that particular line is just brilliant.That's one of my favorite passages. I mean, it's a favorite for exactly what you're describing, it's not fun to read or something you necessarily shouldn't skip. But maaaan is it a great introduction to Reek that really, really sticks with me. Excellent awful opening.That fucking cruuushed me on the re-read. One second he's just laughing and joking, then suddenly he's not just killed but killed *brutally.* Amazing and horrific chapter. I love Brienne's Feast arc and Dick's death is right up there with me as one of the saddest from the series. Great pick.Nope, I'm not familiar with him.Man, I didn't even catch that connection. Ugh, Cersei's the worst.Heh, the finale's maybe my least favorite episode. Awesome show though.

I have time for a long story if you want!Ohh, makes sense. That's basically what I used to do for Heart Scales. Neat!I finished it right before a haircut. I was even less prone to small talk with the hair cutter than usual. Gods, though, I *loved* it - it was brutal and I hated it, but I loved that a Brienne chapter had something so shocking and emotional after what I'd heard about them.Haha, I can relate. Sounds like he [couldn't handle your strongest potions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_FQU4KzN7A) I haven't really played LoZ - only one I played was Ocarina of Time and I couldn't get past some tree level near the beginning; my ex gave me shit for this but I'm 99% sure it was literally impossible - but I had a similar thing in the third Ratchet and Clank game, Up Your Arsenal. One late boss is a giiiiiiiant mech controlled by a mercenary, and you're supposed to beat him by standing in these turrets scattered over the map that do a bunch of damage, firing at him as much as you can until he blows up your turret then moving on to the next one. The turrets do an absolutely absurd amount of damage, way more than any of your actual weapons; in other levels they can blow up virtually invulnerable spaceships and whatnot in just one shot. So the fact that the entire boss fight is based around using them means that he has a looooot of health.

...Well I didn't notice the turrets were there, so I very, verrrrry slowly whittled down from full health using my ordinary weapons, which also meant depleting absolutely all of their ammunition. It's basically impossible to beat him with just your weapons, even all of them with maximum ammo, so I had to work around that in a bunch of repetitive ways. I don't remember how much time it took me to beat him but I know it was a hell of a lot.Generic Quidditch player. Yay for a female athlete. Boo for the idea of her outlasting anyone else. Cool.Yeah, that much I figured was the case. So I really hope Ser Robert Strong blatantly being Ser Gregor plays a big part in her final downfall.Awesome! That's a great way to spin it into a positive. I can get that since I'm also way competitive. Best of luck in that!You're welcome!Based on what?In the Day 39 Ponderosa video alone, like half the jurors say they were rooting either for Ashley in particular or for anyone besides the F3, and that's even outside of post-show interviews where that was made even  clearer. Even Rob said he would have lost to Ashley. But there really isn't much of anything to look for in the episodes to show that.I think a better example of that would be his behavior at the mutiny. You're right that that was a flaw in his game, but I don't think it mattered at the merge, because there's no way to believably pretend Lill ever would have been higher than #6.Holden Caulfield's brother from The Catcher in the Rye. Earlier on another sub I posted about really, really misinterpreting that book and they were referencing that.You're welcome!Oh yeah it's horrible. It's also up close and personal. You *hear* about the awful things Gregor does, but you don't *see* them. You don't see the blood and screams described, for the most part. Here you get a graphic description of him biting into the belly of a living, squealing thing and picking its bones out of his gums... yeah, I think it's self-explanatory why. It's one of the hardest passages to sit through for sure.I haven't seen that movie or show but I fucking love the Deep Blue Something song.Yes. ACOK Tyrion XII:

&gt;"If you release Tommen, yes."
&gt;
&gt;He pushed himself to his feet. "Keep her then, but keep her safe. If these animals think they can use her . . . well, sweet sister, let me point out that a scale tips two ways." His tone was calm, flat, uncaring; he'd reached for his father's voice, and found it. "Whatever happens to her happens to Tommen as well, and that includes the beatings and rapes." *If she thinks me such a monster, I'll play the part for her.*

Tywin brings it up in ASOS and that's where we get the "ill-made, spiteful little creature" scene, adapted more or less word-for-word in the show but with that setup removed. (Of course, that isn't to say Book Tywin isn't an awful irrationally abusive fuckmonster to Tyrion in general - he is - but in *that* scene, that's where much of *that* anger is coming from.)Conleth Hill is fantastic for their Varys, and I think that their Varys is probably better for a TV show anyway. Book Varys would come across a little cartoonish on TV, I think.Yeah but so what? The 80s stuff is on point too. I agree that most of the best stuff is from the 70s while the really well-known 80s stuff isn't as good, but the 80s stuff is still pretty great.Also No Surrender.It just makes me happy to see that the cameras are being effective. Even if we ideally shouldn't need them, I'm happy to see that they're improving things and I hope their use becomes more widespread.I feel a strong urge to rank these.He used to down an entire bottle of Firewhiskey, then run on to the dance floor, hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his\u2013For the Super Baratheon Bros.:

&gt;Robert was the True steel. Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets. He'll break before he bends. And Renly, that one, he's copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day.

For Wyman Manderly... all of his stuff in ADWD Davos IV. I was going to copy bits of it but I couldn't narrow it down, and I was going to do more characters but thinking about Lord Wyman is too fucking exciting for me to think about any other characters now because FUCK YEAH WYMAN MANDERLY!I think it was okay. I don't really remember. I just try to exit with less hair than I walked in with and I usually do a pretty good job of that.I'll probably post the answers soon for any people who are curious. I went through earlier today and screenshotted the same spots in the levels but from more recognizable angles and whatnot.I had Loras as my flair on /r/gameofthrones for a while just in the hopes that show-only folks would ask me why the heck I had a Loras flair so I could explain how much better he is in the books.[ADWD](#b "Yeah, in the books he hears about Ramsay's marriage to 'Arya' (who here isn't Sansa either) and because of how close they were and how awful the Bastard of Bolton is, he decides to break his oaths - recognizing that he's doing so - and march south. He doesn't command anyone to come with him, but he asks if anyone wants to, and in any case, the Lord Commander leading a bunch of wildlings to fight a war for his family goes against basically everything the Night's Watch stands for. It really is 'for the Watch' there - Bowen Marsh is crying as he stabs Jon, which clearly TV Alliser wasn't..")Haha nah that ain't a ramble at all, it's fine. The first one is my favorite for sure but man they're all absolutely fantastic.Yeah I fucking loved this shit when I caught it on a re-read. Really puts into perspective how maybe Draco isn't that bad or James isn't that good - or how, y'know, neither one is too bad or good because they're eleven fucking years old. But I loved that choice by JKR, the first chronological appearance of James having him do the exact same thing that Draco does to piss us off in the first book. It's excellent.Time Keeps On Slippin'. That ending got me hard.I don't know about thaaat. They would be if Lill had told Savage "Hey, I'll join Morgan if you vote out Christa" and he'd insisted that the vote stay on Jon, while being told exactly how to get a majority. (And then had gone to Christa and told her "Hey, Lill wants you out and is on the bottom of our alliance. ...But I can offer you last place in my alliance if you just vote out all the Drakes! :D")I mean, she literally says in the episode that she wants Crystal out.Do you mean the comment a day ago where you said someone not minding Andrew Savage's hat was the same as that person comparing themselves to Jesus on the crossIt's a wonderful world where all you desire and everything you've longed for is at your fingertips - where the bittersweet taste of life is at your lips.Having not watched Survivor in like 3 hours, Rupert is so totally the best ever.I don't know that it totally does, since it's also about more than just the game a lot of the time - and most of the game isn't aired. With J! you see every question and answer, but with Survivor you see less than 1% of what happens and they do heavily edit it into a produced drama.You've missed some damn good ones, yo. Do you have any interest in checking them out?Another season without Hidden Immunity Idols.Yeah, Probst outright said so in one EW article. He said that normally he's open to fan suggestions, but the one suggestion *so* absurd that it makes him laugh is when fans suggest a season with no Idols.

&gt; It\u2019s just given us so much story that I laugh when people hit me on Twitter and say, \u2018You should do a season without any idols and without any twists.\u2019 And I say, \u2018You know, if you think through that for a minute, this is why you can\u2019t always listen to the audience because that makes no sense.\u2019

Apparently out of everything fans tell him, one of the most *laughable* things he ever hears is the removal of a twist without which the show functioned excellently for ten seasons. As [the one who suggested that in his AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25yojp/jeff_probst_here_host_of_survivor_ama/chm14by?context=3), I was of course a bit miffed and more than that basically gave up on ever trying to agree with Probst.This is season 31.And everything you would like to be

You can fly higher than an eagle...As long as Rupert remains amazing I never willEh. It had 16 people and a final two, but I don't know if F2 was the plan until Joe was evac'd, and it still had Idols and the zaniest Exile Island setup ever. The Idols/Exile just turned out to not matter. But a mutiny being offered literally every single round of the pre-merge to people who get Idol clues isn't really back to basics.I don't know that I'd say it's improved necessarily. It's changed, but YMMV on whether that change is good or bad. If you focus mostly on strategy it is, but I think the storytelling has gone down a lot in many of the recent seasons and we don't get to know as many of the contestants as people/characters, which makes it harder to care about the blindsides. And I think it is increasingly reliant on gimmicks and twists.They were found even but not used. Brendan was blindsided with one and one of Stephen/Taj got the other. But yeah either way they were inconsequential enough that they may as well have not been there. Gabon/Tocantins are a great beacon of light in the midst of increasingly Idol-y darkness for that reason.Wikipedia's lyin'. I don't remember who exactly found the Jalapao one but I remember they made a fake one that I think Joe found, I remember it was in the skirt of the Tree Mail idol. And I know for sure Brendan got voted out with one since I was like :O to that happening live.I hope I enjoy it more than this one.They are and they don't, respectively. From the sidebar:

&gt;Showerthought is a loose term that applies to any thought you might have while carrying out a routine task like showering, driving, or daydreaming.Thank you. I didn't realize this either.Two per year and it started in 2000.Write one anyway!I'd go John &gt; Courtney &gt; Keith &gt; Kass &gt; Eliza.Good write-up and obviously a fantastic and long overdue nomination. Is Lex still here because deals?Boo dealsWhen we stood at the altar, Wikipedia swore our future was bright...Hey, if they wanna have blandly annoying dead weight waste a spot in their top 40, that don't hurt me any. They're only hurting their own list.Also Dawn.My brain hurtsI like how in one comment you say it was boring how much I controlled things but then in the very next one say I didn't control thingsIt's all relative yo. This one was more evil in general.Y'all are masochists.Word. Carry on.Truwe. Slothy was thiiiis close to letting it happen.I've downvoted every comment you've been making for days because deals are evil and you should be ashamedIt almost physically pained me to upvote this because, like, "It's Lex! Why does anyone have an opinion on Lex??" but I did anyway because objectively it's a great post. While reading it, I suddenly had an epiphany about my Lex apathy, though. I think there's one big superficial reason why I haven't gotten interested in Lex either way. But I'm still finishing reading the second part of this post so I'll come back to this later.

edit: Okay, you know what I think the biggest disconnect between me and Lex is? And I didn't consciously realize this until, like, just now, but I think it's probably been the #1 obstacle to me caring about Lex. **His freaking voice.** I just... I dislike Lex's voice so much, but I didn't even realize how much I disliked it since it's not as blatantly awful as Chicken or whoever. His voice is just this colossal power generator for apathy, and the more I think about his voice the more it also irks me.

It's like, *right* on the verge of being gravelly but doesn't quite get there. Like, 99.9% of the way to a gravelly voice, but doesn't clear that final hurdle, so what you get is this weird midpoint where his voice is too gravelly to be smooth but not rough enough to be gravelly. It sounds so disconnected, and that makes me disconnected from whatever he's saying and doing. It's not like nails on a chalkboard, since that's shrill and makes you pay attention; it's like... rubbing the palm of your hand across a chalkboard slowly, or something. Just this coarse, *dusty,* but still not *gravelly* sound. It's total chalk dust, like chalk dust come to life and turned into a voice. And I think that that has made me tune out. His stupid chalk dust voice.

(And going back and listening to him talk again, and focusing on this, there's also this whole weird... tension, I guess, to the way he says everything. Since his voice always feels like it's about to break through into rough tones of gravel, but never does, it leaves me just waiting for him to either clear his throat and go back down to a nice, smoother, honey-like voice [or, less likely, cough up whatever's in his throat holding in his breath and go back out into a rough voice.] It constantly sounds like someone who really needs to clear their throat so it's just like, *clear your fucking throat already, Lex!!!* Clear your throat and have the actual voice of an actual person. You're in Kenya drinking animal waste, this isn't the time to politely hold in a throat-clearing, so just get it over with.)

So whenever I rewatch Africa I will just try and pretend he has a less purgatorial chalk dust voice.This is a good post that I'll have to come back to whenever I next rewatch Africa. There's like 0 chance of me caring about Lex half as much as you do, but as of right now I care less about him than roughly 14 other contestants from Africa, and maybe that could change at least. I'll at least try to consider some of this. I think I'll still ultimately settle on "douche", but maybe on more interesting douche than I've historically given him credit for.

I can't remember, what are your thoughts on All-Stars Lex? All-Stars will be my next rewatch and I expect to have a strong opinion of him there.Almost complete but I need to either fix my Greatest Hits YotD or get a new one, and that one's especially important since it's a significantly better game than the black label version. (If you are like me and play the games in large part for the music, at least.) Then I also need GH Ripto's Rage and GH cases.

But I am getting there! And hopefully I will be able to post a complete and more organized collection soon.Aw fuck I misspelled "collection." Nothing good happens when you post after 2 a.m.I didn't think to at the time. There weren't a whole bunch and I don't totally remember them now but I could try to dig them up. /u/Todd_Solondz would probably remember some of them better than I do since I think I had the most with him. And that'd help jog my memory on others.True. &lt;3 But it didn't matter too much game-wise. Not as much as they built it up like it would.I'm happy you find it hilarious instead of frustrating. In that case maybe I won't rewatch...

And let's be real that's like the *only* way to feel about most of Cook Islands.It's a fantastic series! I haven't really played anything besides the PS1 titles and a little bit of the GBA games, but yeah, the PS1 ones are amaaazing. The levels are so engrossing and diverse, the challenges in the first game in particular are incredibly creative, and my god the soundtrack by Stewart Copeland is just outstanding. I'm really happy that it still has such a loyal fanbase!Jessie is the one that made me say roughly 14 instead of just 15.

Also:

&gt;I can't remember, what are your thoughts on All-Stars Lex? All-Stars will be my next rewatch and I expect to have a strong opinion of him there.

Unless you didn't want to answer it for w/e reason which is chill but maybe you just missed it. But I'm gonna be paying special attention to him on that rewatch where I will probably at least walk away with more strong opinions than I have of Africa Lex.I think I'd predict Dreamz over Tina, too.Thank you! Pokemon is the first thing I started to actively collect, but I've loved Spyro for about as long. Got into both of them when I was like three years old.

And ooh, I do not. Do you have a picture of that?Awesome, thanks! I look forward to seeing it.Fantastic picks who should all be in there. Would love to see all three of them in there.What do you mean by "relied entirely on his alliance"? Don't most players?^^^PfftGabon's my #6, only behind 1/3/4/7/10. So it's my favorite past ten, favorite with the F3 or Idols, etc etc. Like you said, the cast is diverse and they're all wildly entertaining on top of it. Absolutely brilliant cast who really carry it.Rupert is a national treasure.Probably Stephen, hopefully SavageOr don't tell him anything either way and he won't know until the final 5 episode.&gt;a season so hardcore that the powers that be were like "This was a little much" and decided to go back to jungle environments.

Actually, season four was originally going to push it even further and be Survivor: Jordan. They had to find a new location last-minute because of 9/11 which is how we got Marquesas, as if anyone knows what the fuck a Marquesas is.Yeah I remember barely even making it through her pre-game video. Her profession was cool but even there she was way bland. No idea why they'd cast her. I mean she's probably a lovely person so nothing against her but it doesn't come across on TV at all.I think what we got was way, way more entertaining than another athletic academic. Garrett blew all my pre-show expectations and fears out of the water.SJDS reunion &lt;333That still doesn't spoil J'Tia or Garrett, though, and they're like the best parts of the season anyway.I was blown away by Andrew Savage having a personality. Wildly exceeded expectations.It's *almost* enough to make me want to watch something as vile as The Biggest Loser.It depends on who they cast.Or her allies. \^_\^Nice!! And no worries; I'm the one who showed up to a thread like 3 months later.That's a fucking melodramatic episode title. I'm surprised it wasn't said by Andrew Savage.Hells yeah! I've wanted something like this for a while, thrilled to see it come to fruition. Thx mods!I'm so thrilled to have caught you of all people on something like this. :P\^_\^ Thank you for the comment! This series is a very happy one. &lt;3 So I'm happy you like the collection!Maybe my collection isn't as complete as I thought..."I'm no fan of Lex"

\- WilburDes, Dec. 1, 2015No, Pigwidgeon Mariano didThank you for the answer!'MericaI'm going for games more than merch anyway. :P So I'm actually fine with my collection (which also includes a mint condition Collector's Edition!) Hers is damn impressive, though!Actually, Stacey formed the first alliance on Tagi. Kelly/Sue were aligned before either was aligned with Richard.I'm not too interested in those either way. I don't really know much about them.Probably has my second-favorite vocals of any Springsteen song, next to Streets of Fire. Nebraska is great and this is one of the most stellar songs off of it; I'd only put Atlantic City ahead of it. But I think this one has an even better story and lyrics. Definitely one of his best.Oh Lord, the theme I missed today was seriously "Mary"? When Springsteen's my favorite music artist ever? Dag, yo.He has been exceeding my wildest dreams.Ooh damn, nice! I didn't know that that was a thing. Thanks for the picture/video!Any HantzBobby Fisher sounds like a straight fuckin' ballerThat Fabio confessional was the first thing I thought of. &lt;3 I can remember his exact inflection. I think it's the only place I've heard of Bobby Fisher before.

Damn though that is tragic. Did he have psychological problems before that?I wonder if chess does it to you or if maybe there's some connection between being great at chess and hidden mental issues.Opening track off 1980's "The River" - and the title of the upcoming River box set!Maybe the people behind the website know how much better SJDS is than the last two seasons.Or just someone who enjoyed SJDS more than you might have

(edited bc minor typo)Enjoy your two years of post-game \#gastrointestinaldistressThe last juror because I make the most money, and outside of that I was probably voted out for being a threat and will likely get a relatively favorable edit. But also, like, thousands of extra dollars compared to other positions.Kass/Eliza/James would all rank way lower for me so I'd love to see them out right away. I don't think any warrant top 32.I still like the post-merge but it's slow enough, and there are enough duds in the cast, that I had to at least put it down below Palau/Gabon/Nicaragua, and I may move it down a few more, too. I respect it a ton for what an objectively "great" season in Survivor history it was at the time, and I'd rather see something like it than something like Cambodia, and it's still very comfortably within my top half, but it's also kind of weird how most of the most pivotal things(/best Tina moments) aren't shown and the cast is definitely the weakest of the first four.He received one vote when Matt went.Rita voted for him. It was a throwaway vote, though, so it doesn't really matter, but he did receive a vote. Way to fuck up the first "perfect game", Rita!Getting Mitchell voted out and getting info on Jeff's past votes.Well at least his "If you [X], you aren't a True fan" rhetoric was aligned properly for once.Tina, Colby, Jerri. Rudy, Sue, and Rupert also need to be in there though. I'd have sworn Sue and Rupert were.It's always fun to apply these to Survivor.

He needs to cut that hair and he will just be perfectOoh we haven't seen Angry Jeremy in forever. I hope he comes back.Joe pleeeeeeeease tie the recordI like all the balancing challenges this season.Oh my god so fucking slanted for Joe lmfaoTo double Joe's odds of safetyNoooo. I'm kinda worried about Kimmi this episode for some reason :/ Though her overall edit feels 5th place-y.omg it's down to the two who the preview looked likeHow the fuck are you even supposed to prevent them from bending thoKeith vs Joe is a fun challenge rivalry I never expectedI wouldn't want to vote him out after thaaat.

But then if I didn't I'd end up Leanning myself, so."It was AWESOME!" God bless that Brazilian demonomg if joe Ciries this shitI just hate that it's between those two :(Did Probst just say that was literally THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT IN SURVIVOR HISTORY lmao noCrucialI hope the SJDS people both play their IdolsThere, see? Abi agrees with me about his hair.:53 seems too late in the night for some wacky double Idol play. My gut says it's just Joe but could go either way.wotSo much for my dreams. :(Fuck the what? How was this a blindside?I rewatched and she wasn't really as complex or consistent as I remembered. Still fun, probably top 50-60 or so, and definitely would rank higher as a casting choice in general but as a Cagayan character, she's not too outstanding.Pretty meh episode. Not bad since the loved ones stuff was great, but not too good either. Joe loses a challenge then is voted out with some random distraction along the way. Ho hum. We had to have this episode eventually I guess, and him passing out does make it a little more memorable.What? What was awkward about it?That's why she's hilariousI could really do without either WentworthOuch, my pride.I wanted to do a post explaining it and I think the post turned out to be interesting and fun.I thought it was like 60/40 but then things rebounded to the initial and obvious outcome anyway so those scenes didn't really mean anything, at least not for this episode.Say literally anything while being Shirin Oskooi.Utterly 0 chance with her edit. I hope she does.WWJD? - "What Wouldn't Jed Do?"Perfect!Excellent cut and fair nomination.Nice!!! I forget, who's left??Ooh thanks. It needs to be updated for these new cuts!!

53 - Stephen

Wimpy little non-leader!!

52 - Natalie

She does not resonate with me in the bedroomWhat if the final three is three of the others? Like Kimmi, Abi, and Keith or something.That would be funny as hell and drop a big ol' bomb on editing analysis so I would be all for it[Hunter](/spoiler) and [John Carroll](/spoiler) in Marquesas.Jeremy's edit feels a lot more consistent. Spencer gets a lot of positive focus but it's kind of up and down. Plus we've had Jeremy spoken of as a jury threat more often than Spencer. Spencer is the only other one who might win but I think it's Jeremy.JFP knows good TV.Now I really hope Rupert gets in so that his induction included Fairplay calling him ugly.I don't think the season has been great. Basically the only two outcomes right now are Jeremy or Spencer winning, almost certainly Jeremy. Of those two scenarios I think the worse one is Spencer winning, so I'm rooting for Jeremy by default.**42) Tracy**

fuck /u/todd_solondzI mean I would say Coach is clouded and deluded as hell and I feel very positively about him as a characterSo much discussion and controversy from parts of this write-up &lt;3 I wish I cared more about Cagayan to take part in it but I'm happy you took this angle instead of just "F.IERCE CHAOS &lt;3"It's like how I'm complimenting B.B. when I say he is probably the worst Survivor player everI honestly dunno how you can only *lean* negative for Keith and Kimmi. Those are pretty clear downgrades.

For me it's weird because like, yeah, Spencer/Vytas/Terry went up... but only because I hated them so much the first time and for Vytas/Terry it's more circumstance than anything. I dunno. I dig these conversations but I guess it'll be easier to have all of them more in-depth once the season is over. But I think that outside of Jeff and Savage, to whatever extent anyone has improved this season it's only because they were weak before it. Like there was no way for Kelley Wentworth to go down unless she was an awful person or something.I wonder if some of that falls back on rankings and wanting to either rank them high or rank them low.I am increasingly hip to all of this after my Australia rewatch. Tina and Australia are very strange ones to rank and write about since the edits are so limited. Ultimately I still rank her high because I know she did those things and I am happy she did them. But not *as* high as before my rewatch.What standard ideas? I feel like Tina is very divisive all around. Lots of people love her, hate her, like her, or like-her-but-love-what-wasn't-shown-so-as-a-character-just-like-her. I don't know that any of them are standard, really.Yeah well that's what happens when some idiot wildcards BaylorYeah for me it would only be Dawngel and then he's like even with Jaclyn.lol I had to think for 10 straight seconds before remembering who went home. At first I thought it was Kelley Wentworth or something.Oh whoops. Thanks.**20. Cirie 1.0**

**19. Cirie 2.0**

I am tired of the persecution of innocent hardworking leaves in this countryHonestly I don't know. It's tough to know where the act ends and actual Tina begins, because she was clearly playing a game to benefit herself as shown by her betraying Maralyn, betraying Mitchell, getting covert info about past votes, and then outright saying on Day 42 that she wanted to win money for herself and not give it to whoever deserved it the most. None of those things have absolutely anything to do with what she's saying or with who "deserves" what. And then outside of the game she does things like insult Jerri's skin in commentary on a mental breakdown or joke about Brian Heidik being murdered. So I dunno. I'm sure it's somewhere in the middle but I think it is further on the side of b.s.I'm So Meta, Even This AcronymGreat write-ups all around. I wish I'd followed this more closely just to see more of your in-depth posts.I guess I was thinking in the fanbase overall and not just hereOh word. Yeah, I'd mostly agree with that then. I think she is probably harsher and more biting than she let on in Australia but restraining that sort of thing isn't too out of the ordinary. And I think the deserving rhetoric was relatively b.s. But the personality we saw is probably basically accurate.I FKIN FORGOT ABOUT JAKE LONG THE AMERICAN DRAGON OMG i thought he was so hot when i was like nine years old or whatever

And dammit I wanted Kim Powers to win :(

I forget when our endgame starts.Here's a [recent comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/3ueqqt/to_add_on_to_a_previous_post_i_saw_what_season_do/cxf8a7n) I made about my Savage love. Stephen was a mixed bag for me this season. His focus on Idols, "Evolution", and "Voting Blocs" is like the exact opposite of anything I'd enjoy and watch the show for. But he did also have a good and sort of emotional sequel to his Tocantins appearance and a fun downfall at the very end. I'll have to rewatch for Stephen's arc eventually to really iron down how I feel about him.**14. Lindsey**

Because fuck your agendas.

**13. Deena**

Slicer fought the law and the law won :(I have changed my write-upThe Todd/Lex cut for a new generation&lt;3And Survivor tells us that this is unhealthy and miserable. It doesn't try to ~inspire~ us to do that.Late reply but yo. I haven't been too big on the season, honestly, and after this last episode + rewatching the Ciera boot I'm still largely back in that same camp even if it had the one strong week. I feel like I don't have any reason to care about most of the contestants. I don't think there are many emotional, character-based storylines going on at all - just a big focus on blindsides and "big moves" which isn't really what I care about the show for. Too many contestants with very small or inconsistent edits, and even those who are shown I don't think really add anything from a character/story standpoint. And the whole "evolution of VOTING BLOCS" and "PLAY THE GAME" angles have really irked me, though it seems to be settling down with Ciera/Stephen gone.Oh hey! I totally remember that clip now that I watch it. Good for him being so multi-talented. &lt;3But for it to really line up with Ocean's Surprise, they'd have to be all melodramatic... I'm trying to think of ways to turn those into ominous-sounding stuff like Ocean's Surprise but nothing's coming to mind.&gt;I agree with her that people would've respected her more if she were male

How do you reconcile this with Cochran's tribe calling him a disgusting coward, wiener, and poor excuse for a man? And Jonathan's former tribemates calling him a rat, wanting to puke on him, and I think more things I forgot since it's CI? I think flippers in general get that treatment. Mutineers die first and such.Except for in the pre-jury house and more importantly after the show where people are actually themselves and not altered negatively by the elements or positively by trying to put on a front for TV/a million dollars.I don't think this response to your post is any more ad hominem than your response to Shirin's Tweet.Honest question: Why do you go out of your way to read her Twitter if you dislike her so much?Damn I should rewatch this movieMy point is that a write-up that says those things can still be positive about the character. Slicer's write-up being positive of Kass as a character really is not an opinion thing.I'm don't think anything Alt said warrants this much hostility.I think this is backwards. The ones surviving on Earth would be the sinners and heathens, right? After the Rapture?I don't think anyone who commented in this thread did so because you directly asked them to comment. But I can stop commenting in this thread if you would prefer for me to do so.People got more in general back then, so it's not like Chris just got an inflated edit; in that same penultimate episode, Julie got 11 and Eliza got 7. Typically what people talk about with shit editing is certain contestants being ignored, but in Vanuatu, nobody received less than 1 confessional per episode on average, and barely anybody received less than *2* on average; Lisa got 1.17, John K. got 1.57, Scout got 1.79, and Chad got 1.8. Everyone else was averaging at least 2 every week.

Vanuatu also comes rather close to having *everyone* get a confessional *every* episode: there are only 17 instances of *anyone* getting 0 confessionals in an episode, out of 150 total episodic confessional counts. Almost all of the seasons that have fewer instances are from less recent seasons than Vanuatu. That season definitely did not have shit editing.After Ami is gone, Chris wins two of the three Immunity Challenges. The Julie boot is the only time they could have taken him out. In any case I think Twila adds a lot to the end of the season (as she always does to any episodes ever &lt;3)If you love the first three then you will almost certainly love Marquesas. It is less "boring" than two or three by a mile. I can't really imagine why someone would think it's boring unless they also think a bunch of the other early ones are.Nice!He said in a post-episode thing that Joe and Keith went over four times as long as any of the Dream Teamers ever did, so he was also talking about that.Oh I agree. It does sound kind of lame haha. Just saying that that's probably what he meant.

Feels odd to be defending something Probst said.Eh, Ozzy won the South Pacific fan favorite vote by a colossal margin. And Kass also got into fights and flipped people off and stuff.

I agree that both juries and viewers are sexist as hell. I just don't think Kass is an example of it.I guess then it's more a matter of you disagreeing with whether those things apply to Kass, not necessarily with the tone of the write-up, since the tone was intended to be positive at least.Agreed and that kind of shows that confessional count isn't everything, since Scout's still a big part of the season. It just also manifests itself in the camp interactions with people like Eliza, Leann, Sarge, or Twila.Oh shit there's gonna be a sequel??Oh I got time then.

How odd that there'd be such a set in stone release date years in advance.https://media.giphy.com/media/jbxQLpOKN2URa/giphy.gifI wishI mean, when the guy Cochran hated the entire time who apparently "bullied him" wins the fan favorite vote by the widest margin of all time, I don't think saying the viewing audience at large loved Cochran is accurate. And didn't Kass get cheers at the reunion? They were both polarizing.If Slicer is saying that he thought Kass was a fantastic character as a result of how those things came into play and blended with her other traits, which is what he said, then yes, that is a positive. I think the write-up explains how those things can be a positive from a TV perspective.

I just don't get how it's possible to disagree that a post that amounts to, centers around, and justifies "KASS&lt;3", while ranking her as roughly one of the 30 best characters in the history of the show at *least*, is positive.I'm confused about how we can't base opinions of who was popular on who was popular.I mean if someone told you they disagree that water consists of hydrogen and oxygen you would probably have a hard time understanding that too. Extrapolating this out to me not understanding the concept of disagreement in general is absurd. I just don't get how you can look at a long post about Kass being a fantastic top-tier character and think it is a negative post.I am saying that he was not *so overwhelmingly popular* that it's fair to say that, in general, "people loved him" when he lost the fan favorite vote by an overwhelming margin to the antagonist of his storyline.&gt;subjective character writeup

Hold up real quick do you think I'm disagreeing with you on Kass? Because that's not what I'm saying. I'm not saying anything about Kass at all or whether I agree/disagree with the write-up, so I don't know if that was miscommunicated or misinterpreted somewhere.

Kass and her character and all that subjectivity aren't what I'm talking about at all. I'm talking about the equivalent to if I said, right now, "sanatomy's posts are completely agreeing with Slicer" or something, and how I don't think it's really possible to 'disagree' that a post consisting entirely of "This is why Kass is an amazing television character" is positive about Kass as a television character.

I don't care if you agree or disagree with the write-up. Only thing I'm commenting on is the fact that it was a positive write-up, which literally is not an opinion, it is a fact that the write-up was praising Kass. And again I don't care if you agree or disagree with any of that praise, I'm just saying it was praise of her TV presence. (For a comparison, if I say that, like, Roose Bolton chills the living daylights out of me and is constantly horrifying in his relentless ruthlessness, that is praise of Roose as a character. Or you can replace that with, like, Voldemort or whatever antagonist you're the most familiar with. This is literally the exact same thing.) But if that's something you're still opposed to for whatever reason then I guess we have to leave it at this since I don't really know how else to say "'Kass is a great TV character' is a positive view of Kass as a TV character."Hahaha. Nah, definitely not. But if they're one and the same, that'd make him even better!I didn't know movies did exact dates that far in advance. I'm only really familiar with Survivor where it fluctuates constantly.He'd gotten a big, positive edit on a recent season and that's basically all it takes. I'm happy we'll have to wait at least one more year for Spencer/Jeremy.Twila's one of my favorite things on the planet but I don't really want to see her again. I think her Vanuatu story is perfect and another season could be awkward, like Ian.She didn't "fire more shots" at them. She answered a question and didn't mention them anywhere in either of those Tweets.I'm almost always like that. Australia's just kinda an anomaly for me and I'm fine with being inconsistent.I would SO support Scout returning. &lt;3 If nothing else because seeing her name on a cast list would be amazing. Like how I'm still happy Kimmi came back even if we barely see her.No such thing!Haha, Pycelle's beard.I'm not saying she'd make it past one day without being medevac'd. I'm just saying they could theoretically cast her!Your alarm could be going off in the middle of a cycle in the first place.To me Scout's legacy is weirdness and being brought back only to implode in episode one would only enhance thatYeah I think this is a better and stronger analysis than just "Vanuatu had shit editing."I don't think Rob was the most in-game hated or even really close to it. By some of them, yeah, but he didn't treat JLew or Rupert like shit, so they didn't hate him, so he got their votes.Definitely new players. No pre-game alliances between pairs, and I thought it was more effective to have a bunch of new players developed at once through their interactions with each other.Shii Ann and Kathy also didn't. Shii Ann didn't care either way and while Kathy was upset, it wasn't hatred.I don't think Gabon is as much of a clusterfuck as people say. I think it's a relatively straightforward game of Survivor for the *most* part... however, it's *played* by a bunch of clusterfuck contestants, so it's still pretty damn hilarious. Have fun.I don't have a full, ranked list, but MacGyver was by far my favorite episode. Lots and lots of character development with virtually all of the strategy deriving clearly and visibly from people's individual personalities, emotions, and relationships. Basically what I wish the rest of the season had been, and while some of the Shirin narrative felt a little forced, it was still one of my favorite episodes in years.Heck, the title of that episode itself was "No Longer Just A Game."If future seasons have Idols, I hope they try this twist again. It was a fun idea that just didn't play into this game.And it comes right after "Queens get dethroned and lightning will strike a lone tree atop a mountain faster than anything." What a fucking epic pair of confessionals.

Clearly the lesson to take away from this is that we need Scout on every season.This is exactly why I liked him more in SJDS. I feel like Jeremy was a much more emotional player last season and it made him a lot more dynamic and entertaining to watch./u/zanidakiseternalomg &lt;3/u/moostronusWhen did Dawn "pretend to play honorably"?

Dawn didn't need a friend. She needed someone who knew how to swim and Brenda was nearby, and iirc Erik had already gone down first. Brenda did what any remotely competent Survivor player *or* remotely decent human being would do.Nah. That's just a big Zoe fan.Clicked link for the dead fish falling down the slope. Was not disappointed.xoxo, bff foreverSecond season of four, but you are right! Like /u/loganwhalen said, John Palyok from Vanuatu.Yes yes YES!!! **WATCH THIS FUCKING SHOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!!!** Oh my god. The format is so amazing, like you said it's surprisingly emotional to say goodbye to the contestants, and also the show is fucking *funny* because people who are isolated and sleep-deprived say and do all kinds of zany stuff.

I'd probably rant at more length if I weren't about to go to bed but **SOLITARY IS SO AMAZING AND ANYONE WHO HASN'T SEEN IT NEEDS TO WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY!!** Seriously the Solitary 2.0 cast ranks right up there next to some of the all-time great Survivor casts for me.Phillip isn't unintentional, though. He was openly playing up a character. Like there's a part where he goes up to Rob and outright says that he should join an acting troupe. And I don't think it's "taking it too seriously"; he just makes me cringe (not to mention getting way too much air time and running the boot order in an awful direction.)

I'm pretty sure absolutely anyone would have wanted anything to entertain them on S22. But for a lot of people Phillip managed to make it even worse.What was his response?/r/totallynotrobots"Stop talking about the parts of the show I'm not interested in!"Sandra, Rupert, Jon, Burton, and LillWhy does everyone hate Cochran so much? Why do people hate Caramoan?He is my heroI love how it's always the leaves, haha. I got my glasses in like first grade and I had no idea the mass of green at the top of trees was actually comprised of *individual leaves.* I figured it was just a big ol' hunk o' green like you see in [clipart and drawings and stuff](http://www.clipartlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tree6.png), and they fell off in the form of leaves or something? But then seeing that there were actually a bunch of teeny tiny leaves up there, that fucked with me.Bruce Springsteen's "Born to Run" albumWho cares what he accomplished in the game? He was a fun character.Cochran has said Sophie was also key in getting him to flip, Dawn voted for Sophie specifically because she thought Sophie was more crucial to Upolu's success, and in any case being the "driving force" doesn't mean you should win.I wouldn't mind so much but we [already have this same exact joke on the all-time top page](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/3acddt/quick_question_dont_upvote/), and this title is a specific reference to [a time way older than that](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/) that for a while was at the top of the entire website.I think I know *exactly* which stock bird sound you mean. Or I've noticed some other one. Is it the one that goes kinda like "*chirp, chirp, TWEET-tweet TWEET-TWEET*!", often at the start of a new scene? I'm pretty sure it was in like four different seasons... though now I can't for the life of me remember which ones. Pretty sure two were Borneo and Cook Islands, though. I'm like 90% on CI being one.Thanks for sharing. His track record with things like this is a major reason why I, as a gay dude, am a big Bernie supporter. He is and has been my ally for decades now. *Decades.* Hillary, meanwhile, "evolved" when (if not long after) it was beneficial for her to do so. Now I don't hate Hillary - definitely wouldn't support her over Bernie, but I'd be *relatively* content with her if Bernie doesn't win - but daaamn do I mind when I see a rainbow H logo or hear Ellen saying Hillary is the most pro-gay candidate out there... just a couple years after Hillary said anti-gay stuff on that same show. Like Hillary as a candidate all you want, but don't put a rainbow bow on it and don't tie it to gay equality. Don't tell me she deserves to get in on some pro-gay historyor is the best ally I have up there. She doesn't and she isn't. Bernie does and he is. Bernie's had my back since before I was born, so - in addition to the many other reasons why he's the best candidate for me and my country - it's about dang time I have his.It feels like that's just Russell's way of picking himself. He picked Amanda because she made it to Day 39 on back-to-back seasons. Now he's picking James because he was fan favorite on back-to-back seasons. Hmm...In either case there are still far better choices than James and Amanda.Yep, I liked her a lot before the season since her pre-show stuff was fun and she had some really fun Twitter posts that showed she had a great personality and sense of humor. Then the season hit and like you say, she was pretty much always in a good spot; it was clear she was expendable with how little air time she got, but that was just because she ended up losing after being hit with a tribe swap. It doesn't mean she was a bad player or character. I liked everything I saw of her outside the show, and nothing on the show made me think I was wrong, so I think if they ever brought her back for some Second Chance season she would be a fantastic addition. It has absolutely nothing to do with her physical appearance, especially since I'm gay, like hell I care about her body, I just thought she seemed fun and smart.It was especially stupid because she wasn't even the most low-visibility character after episode two. For the first two episodes, sure, but after that both Keith and Kimmi were smaller characters than her, but people stuck with the "Monica's so purple!!" thing, and I think it has to be like 99% because of demographics and her previous season.Thinking everyone else is a circlejerk. You especially get this with Cochran, Parvati, and maybe Spencer more recently. Everyone seems to think that whoever disagrees with them is a part of some massive circlejerk of popular opinion. Like, a bunch of people ask "Why does everyone hate Cochran?", but when those questions are being asked so frequently and pro-Cochran stuff is always upvoted highly... clearly it isn't "everyone" hating Cochran, he's just polarizing in both directions.

On Sucks they do an annual popularity poll of every contestant where you score them 0-10 and then all the contestants are revealed by average rating, and I've considered doing that here if only because there's no way popular /r/survivor opinion on pretty much any of these contestants is as extreme as lots of people seem to think it is.When did Kelley Wentworth do anything that could remotely be described as "groundbreaking"?

If it confuses you, ask. Don't just be like "Oh, well, *I* don't get it so I guess it's because of her butt LOL!!!"Absolutely. She'd be one of my top returning player picks. Maybe my top one as far as pre-mergers go.Nice! I want one of these. I never had one - how does it, like, train your Pokemon or whatever?In Diamond there is a counter app on the Poketch which I think was specifically made for EV counting.Megas could have a different typing, though.Gen III. Love Hoenn, love Kanto, love the GBA graphics/music, love the first 386 Pokemon. Also see flair.Earliest one I can remember is Bulbasaur in Red. When I was like three or four years old, I had a Venusaur before Lt. Surge, and I was firmly convinced that this made Venusaur the best Pokemon ever. I always chose Bulbasaur when I was a kid because of this. Hunter is hilarious and amazing. Hunter is a fucking god and when I grow up I want to be a cross between Hunter and Moneybags.Sparx is adorable. He was my favorite character when I was a kid and I still like his YotD voice. I always thought the Sparx levels were a neat addition to YotD. Different gameplay and it's cool to play as him after I spent two games just having him as an ally.Yeah, Enchanted Towers is amaaazing. In general though they're so short-lived that it just doesn't feel as engaging as some of the other challenges that are built into the levels themselves. Agent 9's Lab is also probably the weakest level in the series.I feel like Keith has been even more minimal than Courtney. Still a fun minor character, though, who would probably end up as one of my favorites from the season lol. I don't think I'd have Kelley/Jeremy in my top half as of right now.Rudy has more of a story, Frank is more of a cartoon character. With Rudy I'm laughing with him, with Frank I'm respectfully laughing at him.That he wasn't eliminated sooner? \^_\^The difference is in both cases you were wrong and I was right because Jon is amazing and Tony isn't. :DI'm so happy Jon made it this high &lt;33333 This is definitely a fair spot for him now. Man I gotta finish my Jonclyn tome in my Sucks thread.

Courtney is a legit nom though I'd have her like 10 places higher (which with this small # of remaining contestants is a lot.)For me personally it's Courtney as an incredibly clear standout, then a painfully mediocre cast otherwise. But I'm a weird idiot soBookmarking for a China rewatch. I think I should really, really be a bigger James (and Peih-Gee?) fan than I am so I will have to check out that season.

Dammit and my list of rewatches just gets larger and larger...Yeah I do not buy into that at all. A wholly cold, cutthroat, diehard feminist lesbian dominating a battle of the sexes season by spinning a web of False emotions would be a pretty fun character, but that's not what Ami was. Sometimes she was cutthroat in the game, definitely unafraid to make her own possibly controversial calls, but she only had the power to do so because she's a really sweet person that people actually liked. I think people get attached to her "Ice Queen" nickname/persona and don't want to look at the parts of her story where it really doesn't add up.To be fair someone as rough as Twila probably drinks bleach every morning to wash down her milkless bowl of nails.Plus this ending could actually go multiple different ways.I'd love to see a long Ami write-up from you wherever she ranks. I think she has never really clicked for me because I've tried to view her as entirely one-dimensional when she's really not (I actually, in my own ranking, would have cut her much earlier in the original Rankdown, but she's someone I especially think I'll enjoy more with more analysis and a rewatch, so I didn't want to rob her.)Val Collins will return and win, taking home a second million dollars for her tribe after Jeremy's (based on the edit up to this point.) Eat your heart out, Romber; there's a new Survivor power couple. &lt;3[Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6UWNA-WQgI)Very happy she was Idol'd. I don't like the rationale for this cut at all. If there are two amazing Sandras, let them both make the endgame. Let them both make top two for all I care. They should each rank exactly where they should rank on their own, not have one rank lower because she's not as good as the other Sandra; if she's not as good, then that'd still be shown through their natural rankings based on their own merits. (Of course, I also strongly prefer HvV Sandra, and for me, ranking her in that top three was absolutely about what she brought to HvV and not about Pearl Islands at all.) So yeah I am thrilled about the Idol here.Interesting. Personally I think she has more one-liners in Pearl Islands but is more fleshed-out here. Although her one-liners here are also more confident and complex and not just based around funny swear words.&gt;It's a little more lopsided, but post-merge HvV Sandra is waaay more important than postmerge PI Sandra.

This raises another point: if we'd gotten ton of Sandra in the pre-merge, it could have turned into a Mike or Jeremy(?) type situation where she's SO positive for SO long that it just gets tiresome and you can't feel interested in rooting for her. Here, we see part of her story told through Rob and we get little nuggets of her personality, but then she breaks out into her own *full* character later on enough that you're more interested in it than you probably would be if she'd been firing on all cylinders from the premiere.

PI Sandra is a consistent, like, 6-8/10 in terms of relevance, while HvV Sandra maybe starts at a 2-4 depending on the episode, but then she spends half the season as a 10, so there could have been a feeling of being burnt out by her if she'd also been a central character early on.#&lt;3&gt;actually gets to take down the villain at the end by herself.

Ooh. This is a great point. It seems like an obvious one and it's probably part of why I rank HvV Sandra higher but I've never specifically, consciously thought of or about it before.What do you mean by Sandra not being the best-suited character for that? I think she is an incredibly epic character with a great scope of development in that season.

I'm (in the near future - hopefully gonna start before 2K16!) going to do a ranking of every contestant's final confessional, and big spoiler but freaking look at how AMAZING HvV Sandra's is:

&gt;"Russell is obnoxious, so I took his hat and I threw it in the fire. I don't care. He can take his bald-headed tail to Tribal Council. It'll be alright, he can wear his buff on his head. He has a big bald patch right here he doesn't want nobody to know about. But we've been here for 39 days, I've seen it a *whole* ton of times. Screw it. That's payback for everything he's done to me in this game. I don't care. I don't think it's about the money tonight. I think it's about the title of Sole Survivor. That's all Russell wants, and if that's what Russell wants, that's what I gotta make sure Russell does not get. There's not a day that didn't go by that I was tryin' to focus on 'What's the best way for me to get rid of Russell?' And the worst thing of all is that those Heroes? Each and every one of 'em are responsible for their own self-destruction. When I was out there, I had to hustle, I had to make sure all my stuff was in order so that when I went to Tribal Council, I made it out in one piece. I didn't hide behind no Immunity Necklace. I never had safety; I had to take care of myself. And yet here I sit: Final three. I think I deserve it. *I* want the title of Sole Survivor."

I think that confessional's epic as hell. It covers a bunch of different elements of her character (only things it's missing are Outback Steakhouse and her husband, but her husband was mentioned elsewhere on day 39 anyway iirc) and *all of them are things that were mentioned earlier.* Draws together her whole story, the central one of the jury stage onward, into an epic conclusion going right into the Final Tribal Council. It explains everything about how she got this far, how she's going to get the jury votes, how she feels on the people around here, how she played. 

I dunno, I think her HvV story is epic as hell and it's straight-up *the* reason HvV is in my top ten. I don't think absolutely anybody outright carries a season on even close to the level Sandra carries HvV and makes the whole show worthwhile. It's an epic story and its scope covers her gameplay, the idea of "heroes vs. villains", dethroning Hantz and literally taking his self-ascribed crown, her humor, her loved ones at home... she's such a complete character in that season.

...Now I see in a reply that you say you worded that incorrectly so I guess maybe don't take this as disagreeing with you after that clarification but w/e I'm posting it anyway because **CHANGA &lt;333333**I am so honored to have this title.If he knew what eventually happened to Tom Riddle, Sr. then he could probably piece it together fairly easily.Kinda in the minority on this sub in that I've never seen Bruce live, but from my perspective I'm happy with this decision. The River isn't really my favorite Bruce album (probably around #10) but this seems like a legit way to do this. If nothing else I'm hyped to see and hear Wreck on the Highway which probably wouldn't be too likely otherwise.I was AWOL for a while. What was some of the half-assedstuff?I'm trying to gain a monopoly over the entire Survivor reddit fanbase so if you don't let me do it I will hate all of you forever.[BOOM.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/3utlpp/december_invisibility_cloak_announcement/) More words about Ogden than you've probably ever read from someone besides JKR combined. Bob Godgen &lt;333It wasn't the same events every time.Yeah but this one, in addition to being the first one in however many years so nobody in living memory remembered how they worked, was also set up more to kill Harry Potter than to provide a fun viewing experience.If you Google "Survivor popularity poll 2015" it should be the first resultNot really. If we're going for skilled players, there's a bunch of people who actually won who should be in there before Amanda, and I have a hard time imagining a serious argument from someone besides kenc that she's a more memorable or important Survivor character than Rudy Boesch or Rupert Boneham."On second thought, let's not go to IMDb. It is a silly place."Holy fuck YES. *YES.* Admittedly I've only seen up through the first movie, but my god I've rewatched basically everything up to it so many times. Yes.Every video I found of players reaching Jed involved the intended path that uses multiple supercharges, except for one where they did a 270 to land on the last little wooden ramp. This is probably a pretty common thing to attempt - when I was like six I figured this is how you got him and then gave up and decided the stupid level was impossible - but I haven't seen it actually done. I'd be interested in why you think a lot of people know about it.Minor thing: Chet had a bad foot infection and only asked to be voted out because his options were that or a medevac and he wanted to at least get a TC torch smuff.

Still love the hypothetical, though.I think it'd need to be one of those last two. Dave, Alex, Heidi, and Christy on the jury doesn't look great for Rob over Jenna. Not sure whether Matt or Deena would have gone for him either.We could have seen more of [her amazing friendship with Leslie &lt;3](http://leslienease.blogspot.com/2011/03/courtney.html)Season twenty-two has no returning players. Rob/Phillip are an unbelievably awful pair to have dominate a season's air time and Hantz on three of four seasons was ridiculous.

Or maybe remove all the god-awful reactions to Sue's quit because fuck that.&gt;he didn't allow yau-man to win

In a game? How dare he!

Yau-Man made a deal and it backfired, same as tons of other players.., only his deal involved exploiting Dreamz's socioeconomic status. One of the coldest, cruelest moves we've ever seen on Survivor.Self-proclaimed, probably none besides Brian.I don't think it's "obvious" that it's a top five season at all. Some of those post-merge episodes are really unnecessarily lame, and the Tyler Perry Idol was brutal. I mean I can get putting it in a top five, but I don't think that's necessarily "obvious." I rank it around #19.I've never really loved Cagayan as much as most people do past the pre-swap, but for a while every single time it came up on here people unilaterally adored it - which is fine since people have different opinions, but I've been seeing a *lot* more comments like this even over the past couple days, and it's nice to know that I'm not alone on here.Because clearly not liking Spencer as much as the rest of /r/survivor does means you're detracting from the conversation.Kass/Woo FTC. I don't even really care how it goes after that. Kass wins, holylol. Woo wins, we probably get to see a lot more of him and probably less of Tony. That'd take away a bunch of my problems with the season and give me an outcome I like a lot more at the end, too.Colton would have received roughly -472 votes.Ah, gotcha. I have not seen it in them but I also don't really watch speedruns. Oh well. It was new and exciting to me and clearly to some others here.Russell Hantz, Phillip Sheppard, Colton Cumbie. Hantz was and remains my least favorite thing to happen to the franchise, Phillip was the worst thing to ever happen to one specific season, and Colton... Colton. There are other contestants I dislike quite a bit but that bottom three is so easy for me.His dance after Sue quits was classless. I think it's worth checking them all out eventually if watching every season appeals to you, but skipping 22 and 26 in particular really wouldn't be a big loss.

Soon you're coming up on a lot of seasons that have returning players, though. 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 27 all had players from previous seasons that you haven't seen, so after SJDS and Cagayan it might be better to go forward from when you stopped watching (which sounds like it'd be season nine, Vanuatu, a pretty freaking excellent season.)Yeah but that's happened with a bunch of other contestants since then. With KShinn it's at least a running joke sometimes.I think both 29 and 28 are absolutely worth watching. Cagayan has four returning players on this season but SJDS has three, so it's not really a big difference, and I think SJDS is miles better. Cagayan is more popular here but both have diehard fans and are absolutely worth watching.Before Caramoan I remember most people thinking Allie/Hope/Laura were all identical, but I felt confident Laura would outshine the others and be a high point of the season (although with her early departure she turned out to only be a high point because everything else sucked so hard.) Also called Jonclyn as the stars of SJDS. It's almost enough to halfway make up for thinking Phillip would be the most popular winner in Survivor history.Yup. Basically the worst thing to ever happen on Survivor ever.You're welcomeSee my other reply. I didn't know that, but oh well. It was new to me and clearly to some others as well.Whoa. That's fucking awesome.#ARAS, NOOOOOO!!!!!Aah gotcha. That's still very different, though. The impression I had was of GRRM thinking "They liked Oberyn? I'll just write a new Oberyn!" which is so un-GRRM-y and still not in line with those quotes. So that's definitely different. Thanks.I wear them.There are very, very, very many more than 20 Pokemon that only evolve by leveling up.Yup. I have a level 100 Psyduck, ~~Pikachu,~~ and Charmander, and none of them will evolve now....lol oops.

Still, I'm not evolving her. &lt;3He hasn't "bullied" Stephen in literally any capacity.On the other hand, comments like this just make me love Savage even more.

We fuel each other, you and I. &lt;3&gt;even though Survivor is "only" a game, this game doesn't preclude emotions and personal attachments

How can you say this right after saying that Dawn was unlikable and insufferable because of *her* emotional response to playing Survivor with people she cared about?

Also, she had a mental breakdown when her teeth fell out because she lost them when she was traumatically mugged by a student, and being by herself without her teeth gave her a flashback to that. Really hard to fault her for that.Why?Ometepe, Bikal, Ometepe.I think I have three copies of Tony Hawk's Underground. Otherwise it'd be a tie at two copies between that, a bunch of Pokemon games, and one more game.Believing that is fine, being a stupid dicknose about it like whoever created this picture isn'tHE POISONED STEPHEN'S WATER SUPPLY, BURNED HIS CROPS, AND DELIVERED A PLAGUE UNTO STEPHEN'S HOUSE!Drew ChristyNice! I tried to get this one going a few months back but nothing came of it so I'm really happy to see it come to fruition.

Well played on "ninja stealth edit".&gt;He's a character that extracts emotion from you whether you like him or not.

If those emotions are negative, then people will hate him.

I don't think literally anything Phillip ever did was even remotely entertaining for a second, and I don't think it's really impressive to improve on a second try when he was literally trying to lose his first season.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivorRankdown/comments/2cuxe9/round_02_494_contestants_remaining/cjjav5n) is a long post I did like a year ago on why I hate Phillip.Borneo, Gabon, Nicaragua. Maybe Pearl Islands, there are some duds in there but the good ones are *so* good that it balances it out. Sandra, JFP, Rupert, and Lill all on the same season is insanity and basically an all-star season, then you also get Burton and Savage and even fun supporting characters like Ryan S., Osten, Christa, Shawn, and Trish. That cast isn't as solid all-around as Borneo or Gabon but its highs are so high that it makes up for it.

Borneo's cast is the best, though. That shit's the Born To Run of Survivor casting. Every single casting choice was A+ with maybe, like, one or two A-'s at the absolute worst, no filler.Some of them could be up in the air but defffffinitely Sansa VII for ASOS/the series in general. AGOT probably Visery's death, Clash almost certainly HotU, Feast probably Cersei's arrest, Dance I'm not sure between for the watch or Davos IV or the Epilogue.And now your watch begins.Alex Bell married Kim Powers, and Richard married a guy he met on the pre-jury vacation in All-Stars.When Kourtney was undergoing some medical stuff for her medevac injury, they also found out that she had cancer. Wonder whether they'd have found it early enough to treat it if she hadn't been in a hospital for the injury.

Jimmy Johnson also was in really bad shape physically when he first applied but completely changed that so he could get on Nicaragua and said the difference in his health between his first application and Nicaragua is so great that Survivor basically saved his life.You're welcome! I think Richard is especially unknown, and Alex/Kim were relatively small characters from different seasons, so they're not the easiest to recall.He had a son before Borneo who appeared in his audition tape. Not sure whether he had any after Survivor.Not small, but *relatively* small. Most people don't really think of either of them when they think of the season. I think Jenna, Matt, Rob, Heidi, Deena, Christy are all definitely bigger in Amazon and probably the entire merge tribe (other than maybe Kelly? but other people seem to remember her a lot more than I do) as well as Silas/Lindsey in Africa.Immensely. If it's someone producers like, they have literally no reason to not do it, and in any case they surely do it on accident because of course more cameramen will be filming the area where the Idol actually is.I don't see that at all. It looks to me like Stephen just didn't fit in. In any case, the very nature of Survivor is that you have to get someone besides yourself to be on the outside, since someone's formally deemed the outsider every round and you don't want it to be you, so *if* he was doing that, that's just the game. I mean, Stephen also talked pre-game about wanting to get Savage out as early as possible. Savage is just the one who seemed to be doing better at it.Skupin 2.0 is good, but Skupin 1.0 is amazing. The entire pig saga is weird as fuck and hilarious.Way to break the streak of "X the Y".EDGIC:

Jimmy - MORP

Cindy - MOR

Sheen - OTTM

Libby - MOR

Carl - OTTP

Bolbi - OTTN

Goddard - UTR

Weird Alien Host - OTTNN

Also I forgot how cute Goddard is. &lt;33They're all too busy targeting each other to notice or care. They'll all want him out at the end, but then he'll win the last two challenges and take home a unanimous victory over Jimmy, even after voting out the ideal goat (Sheen) in third. It's Tocantins all over again.Sheen's OTTN persona will annoy the casuals enough that they won't vote for him to return. This whole thing feels very familiar, right down to the name...He was one of the most entertaining ones that season for sure, but I think his exit was well-timed and he could have been less interesting had he stuck around, and in any case his medevac is one of the best moments ever. Plus if he sticks around who knows whether Ogakor wins and Colby/Jerri become such household names. So I'm good with it.All I have left now is half of Gnorc Cove, the last chest in Gnorc Gnexus, and then Gnasty's Loot!Oh shit. I dig it. Nice.&gt;Like does anybody think back to Silas and think that he's a great character?

YesSilas also has a top 3 Edgic strip of all time:

UTRP -&gt; CPN -&gt; CPN -&gt; CPN -&gt; CPN

&lt;3Swap Lex with Clarence and I totally agree."So Coach Bolbi, first three days. What's it been like? How do you find strength with all the hunger and the rain?"

"Well, as Marcus Aurelius once said, 'Slap slap slap! Clap clap clap! Slap slap slap! Clap clap clap!'"OH

my GOD

if you thought running through gnasty's loot and absorbing an unbelievable amount of yellow/pink gems was satisfying before

just imagine doing it WITHOUT HAVING TO COUNT AND CONSTANTLY RE-CHECK YOUR COUNTS after having COUNTED AND RE-CHECKED *EVERY LEVEL OF THE GAME*The system. Is down.

The system. Is down.

The Cheat. Is grounded.Reddit is Spencer and Sucks is Kass.I think it looks good anyway. Plus that layout makes rankings possible which are a big part of (the good parts of) Sucks.My guess is that they were not downvoted when llama first commented.From the roughly 48 seconds I've spent in OT, I think looking terrible is pretty fitting for it.Then the people who only post in Proper would leak elsewhere. Proper needs to stay.Yess, I'm so with you on every word of that Dreamz section. Absolutely agree with you on that deal.

Main difference between your Fiji opinions and mine is I find Lisi entertaining and like Yau a little more, which is balanced out by liking the Edgardo blindside a little less. It's "in the middle" for me in terms of not being bad or good, which by Survivor standards puts it lower on my list. I rank it #22. Ed blindside is fun, Yau and Dreamz are good characters with some really compelling stuff in the endgame, and Earl is really great, but there's so much ugliness, so many forgettable contestants, and such awful twists that I can't really overlook all that and say I straight-up enjoy the whole product. It's a worthwhile season of Survivor that I'm generally happy is a part of Survivor canon, but juuust barely so because so many parts of it are unpleasant or weird. Pretty bad for Survivor but pretty decent on its own.I think Cecilia deserves that note more than Brianna.

Hunter, Angie, and Leslie are my favorites. Not sure how I'd rank them but probably Leslie &gt; Hunter &gt; Angie. Reaaally like all three of them though.The poster blocking script is amazing.Spyro the Dragon! Pokemon - lots of Pokemon! And lots of Spyro! Also Tony Hawk and Ratchet/Clank!&gt;I didn't finish Cagayan

I envy you for that.Abi-Maria is upset with somebody for some duration of time.Three things I'd love to see: 2-1-1 vote at final four; all votes but one Noneified by Idols; someone gives up Immunity but then plays an Idol.It's a real shame for Tony to lose to as few as 6 other people from Cagayan.:( @ him not being wildcarded.

&gt;they showed us multiple times was playing in a way only he could get away with.

My problem is *we absolutely never saw how or why he could get away with any of it, ever.* Like, technically not NEVER because we saw roughly four seconds of him talking to Spencer about being a cop in a scene that was entirely focused on other stuff, but mostly it was just "Here is a spaz who betrays everyone with no remorse. Oh, but he wins because... uh... Big Moves I guess."

That said I completely agree with absolutely every word of the second comment.Oh those were three separate things. I'll make it a list to make that clearer.Yeah the first time reading through the series, Jojen and Meera are so neat! Howland is the cool guy that saved Ned! So when I hear people in the series talking shit about how the crannogmen fight, I feel like it's just prejudice against the "frog-eaters." But then you read that and... yikes.I think Tocantins might be the closest we've come. If Stephen or Erinn had won that challenge, they would have voted for JT while convincing him they were voting for Taj, so it'd be 2 on JT and 1 on Taj. Taj can't vote for herself, so *maybe* Stephen/Erinn tell her the vote is JT... but they have no reason to do so: that risks a 2-2 firemaking challenge in which JT would slaughter either Stephen or Erinn. So most likely Stephen/Erinn keep it safe from Taj so Taj votes for whichever of Stephen/Erinn didn't win Immunity, JT votes for her, and Stephen/Erinn vote for him, and he goes home 2-1-1.

If Taj wins, then it's probably 2-2 between JT and Erinn, and if JT wins, it's the 3-1 we got, but I think Stephen/Erinn winning turns it into a 2-1-1 vote, unless they decide to tell Taj, but I don't think they have any reason to do so.

Definitely would have been exciting. I can't think of any other season in which we came close.Yeah there aren't exact eras but I think these ones are pretty much as on point as possible, but of course even within 1-8 you have a lot of really different stuff going on.

Also to OP I really wouldn't say 21 is in with 22-24 at all.Eating a candy bar.&gt;he really did seem to be genuinely trying to help Anthony out, albeit in the worst and least effective way possible

No, he wasn't. The second Anthony took Rocky's "advice" and started openly defending himself, Rocky just got even angrier and yelled over him. Rocky was just a douche who wanted to be a douche but decided to put up some flimsy pretense of "tryin' to help you out, bro" to make himself look marginally less repulsive than he blatantly was, which is clear in his actual actions.The thing is I don't view Terry in Panama as an amazing underdog. I view him as an annoyance that I want to go away. Casaya Pagonging La Mina is a surreally amazing way for a season to play out for me.Totally with you on HvV Hantz. He himself is repulsive but it gives us the great Sandra win and he's built up as a villain like he finally should be in the later stages... but he's still kind of an anti-hero given undue credit/air time in the early episode so I dunno.

NaOnka is like two separate contestants in one to me. I can't stand Confessional NaOnka where she's just randomly mean-spirited and says gross shit about Kelly Bruno, but TC NaOnka is fucking amazing and hilarious.

I really like Tony as a casting choice and want to be a fan of him but I hate how his story played out in Cagayan in particular. I hate the Tony we got but I think Tony Vlachos the guy is generally entertaining.

Brandon in South Pacific theoretically brings a lot of interesting stuff - his backstory about being in a gang and how he found Jesus and all that and the tragic way it blows up at the end is on its own some of the best shit ever on Survivor - but then he also gets an edit that makes it hard to say I like him as a character when I hate what the show's doing to him, and he himself is just a big ol' cock most of the time, and so much of his air time is devoted to Hantz. So I have no idea how to feel about him because I WANT to like him but at the end of the day he just makes the season ickier for me to think about.That'd be a mess, haha, but if he'd somehow managed to come up with it and orchestrate it on Day 38 he'd be a fucking genius. Both of them voting for Lisa wouldn't happen because it doesn't benefit either of them, but convincing her to vote out Lisa then voting for her would be, like, inhumanly beautiful. I don't think anything like that has happened, someone telling someone else to throw a vote just to take them out. The edit kind of made it look like Russell did that sort of thing to Tyson in HvV but post-game stuff all says Russell didn't do it which honestly is clear if you critically examine even the episode itself. So I can't think of an example of something like what you're saying.As far as my first live reaction goes, definitely Fabio. Others from when I've watched live are HvV Sandra, Bob, Nat White in retrospect, and Denise.I don't know that I'd call myself obviously the best poster, but thank you!

But yeah, diehard Suckster. I'm more active on Reddit recently because my own thread has been so dead but Sucks is my one True love and I'll definitely revive my presence there, hopefully sooner rather than later.Spencer or Stephen go home and Kimmi/Monica/Ciera all get multiple confessionals. Really don't want Angkor to lose again since there's no way Tasha would go home right now and I'd haaate to lose any of the others.Yup!RC? Is that you?Yeah, some other friends told me that it starts off pretty weak and is episodic enough that I can start in the middle of season 2 or some other place, so I probably won't watch it fully in order. I did want to start with the first episode just to see how shit is initially set up and introduced. From there I'll either keep going in order and if it sucks just know it's supposed to improve, or I'll just move on to better stuff. Or probably I'll go in order and I can move on later if it sucks, I don't know.Hmm. I agree that maybe it's not out of nowhere but, if not, I think it's more likely because he finally didn't have to talk to people or think about votes anymore so he was able to become decent.I don't know why we'd see tonight over other nights. One loss or victory doesn't change the pattern of challenge results. And also there can be multiple problems.F2.

I would also really like to see them try some seasons without Hidden Immunity Idols. I think they can soak up air time, make the show repetitive and boring, and take a lot of the emotion out of the show. Not saying to never include them at all ever, but *some* seasons without them couldn't hurt. I'd rather they be an occasional (or even frequent) "twist" than a fundamental part of the game of every season.Previously On segment looks great for a Ta Keo winner.

If only I could remember who's actually on Ta Keo.I hate that Jeff is out but I'm so happy that Woo is in. &lt;3"The decision was up to me" um and the woo/savage/tasha majority lolJon/Burton/LillianOh I thought she was on Bayon still.

Now with this scene it looks like Spencer/Monica are on Bayon, I thought they were on Ta Keo. I don't know.Cut immediately from a confessional about women to talking about clams...Oh my god FINALLY a Kimmi confessional like this. &lt;3Separate reward challenges pre-merge are such a waste of timefuck off probstOh yeah I forgot Keith is randomly great at carnival games.

And also is on the season.Jeremy, you already have him surrounded. Now just throw him over the edge...oof abioh my god

abi

that is the worst False equivalence since dan foley's "i'm adopted"

quit while you're... not ahead, but only as far behind as you are nowWait, so she's totally volatile and hard to manage, but her keeping you in the game is her selling point... but *getting rid of* her would be the emotional decision? That's.. different.This challenge would be better if instead of bags they were water balloons and instead of targets they were clones of CarynHoly fuck that makes his fucking avocado cutting look competent oh my god Stephenlol if angkor winning a thing is only because the fish flopped so hardMonica no

Never say thatHow the hell is it between Kelly and Spencer when the episode is *so* Monica going home?

Will she interfere to save Kelly to try to rally the girls and it'll backfire? Or maybe it really is just one of Kelly/Spencer. I'll fucking love if it's somehow Spencer.That whole "Monica isn't playing for Bayon, Monica's playing for Monica" confessional sounded like one Monica would have given in BvW.Kimmi nuuu :(Does literally anyone in this thread think Monica even might survive this vote orIt'll be the most meta subversion ever if she miraculously survivesThat Stephen answer made me happy.Okay props to Spencer for dropping that obscure reality TV trivia.:(((((Typically if you're, like, LJ or something you can probably figure out how/why you got blindsided, but I wonder if Monica has any freaking idea whatsoever. While it was pretty telegraphed to the viewers, that sequence of events on the island was pretty nuts.I love Monica and hate to lose her but maaaan Kimmi was great this episode.I love that man.okay i get woo's face is pretty but did you really have to fill an entire post with it over and overOh that's fucking excellentThere's no reason not to show her. In a season like Vanuatu, Chad and Leann aren't the most interesting, but they still get at least one or two confessionals virtually every week because it's not hard to throw in five seconds of narration like that. We could have really easily gotten a Kelly confessional about losing the challenge or something. Even just those few seconds would have made a difference.Every single word of it is amazing reallyI suddenly want to see you running the path to Jed in Tree Tops...Yeah unfortunately I agree. In one interview, Probst named "Try one more season without Hidden Immunity Idols!" as proof that they can't always listen to fans... like, apparently out of every single thing he's ever heard a fan suggest, the one suggestion *soooooo* absurd compared to *all* the others, and *so* baseless that he doesn't even have to explain *why* it's absurd, is trying a season without Hidden Immunity Idols.

Maybe it's just because [I'm the one who suggested another Idol-less season in his AMA and his reasoning there was vague and didn't really add up](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25yojp/jeff_probst_here_host_of_survivor_ama/chlz42q), but honestly that quote about how *no* suggestion's as absurd as "Try removing Idols for one season, like the first ten seasons" irked me enough that I kind of want to apply to Survivor *just* to eventually see him in casting and debate it with him, haha. (Also would obviously want to tell him how wrong he is about Samoa and explain the rewatch potential of Survivor + why his Marquesas rating is mad silliness.)Oh there's no way I'd cave. \^_\^ That'd be fun, though. Maybe some day if I apply and get far enough.*Back-To-The-Server*I was so torn. Monica creating a women's alliance would be amazing but all of Kimmi's content was great, too.

I have no idea how Sucks is possibly reacting to this, especially when it comes just weeks after Abi-Maria voted out Peih-Gee.That's an understatement.Yeah the Monica vote was way predictable, but I don't think it was for the worse. It didn't make the episode boring or repetitive or anything. It just gave us an episode that felt like very standard Survivor, which to me honestly felt kind of refreshing since we haven't had that yet this season. Episode 1 it felt like we didn't really see why Vytas went, episode 2 had a lot of references to past seasons, episodes 3/4 were more suspense-based, so having an episode that just gave us a clear story tied to this season without suspense... it was a really cookie-cutter Survivor episode but that just makes me feel like I'm watching Survivor. And while I need to rewatch I feel like it blended character/strategy decently, too, since Kimmi/Monica brought their own personalities into their strategy and their dynamic was exposed in a camp life scene early on.

I'm surprised people had much of a problem with this episode. Monica was one of my favorites and I hated to see her go but I still thought it was a fine week of Survivor.&gt;The editors could have done that if they wanted to but that would mean intentionally leaving out what we saw and distorting the story to make us think Kelly was going. THAT would have pissed me off.

Yup I agree. Manufactured doubt gets way old and is randomly inserted way too much, especially last season ("WILL SIERRA FLIP??????" nope.) Happy this one seems so far to be moving away from it.

I *do* wish Kelly got more air time though. Even if her confessionals are boring, show us like ten seconds of her talking so we can decide for ourselves and that makes the episode so much more complete. But that's a different issue.Or maybe people didn't find those episode as stellar as you do. I mean I'm loving this season and episode 3 has been the only sort of low point for me, so I'm not one of them, but that doesn't mean people can't just disagree and like things less than you might have.On the other hand, we've had many suspense-driven episode so far, and episodes like this that that focus on *how* it happened rather than *what will happen?* are what make rewatches possible. (The most consistently strong episodes, of course, are those that manage to focus on both.)I like the idea of using this for the next one.Aww. You just made cockroaches kind of adorable.You just made me look at the ceiling.

I've always been afraid that that'll happen with some other bug (never encountered a roach) while in the shower.I love how he says "get this out of the way." Like it was something that just *had* to be addressed so Shannon's doing everyone a favor by dealing with it now instead of later.Ooooooooooooooooooh fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck yup. Thaaaat's it right there.

The way she brought up her boob job at the reunion was also awful but if we factor in reunion shows that gives us like a billion other options. Pre-reunion... yeah the cringe is never as strong as it is there. What the *fuck* Kat.**ALLLL-STAAAAAAAR!**Hero challenge maybe?Ohhh you meant the most recent episode. In that case yeah I have no idea.You're welcome!Mark Burnett's book about the first season costs one cent on Amazon.I would so watch The Amazing Race if they cast Cliff/Woo.Haunted Towers!NANA NANA NANA NANANANA NANA NANA NANA NANANANA
I think Jan would have beaten Clay but it's hard to say. We really saw almost nothing of what the other contestants thought of her... and Clay certainly wasn't well-liked either. Helen probably would have regretted not having a gun with that F2, haha.

I don't think Ted's vote was ever up for grabs at that point. Helen just needed to hear "I'm sorry" from Brian, Jake was fine with Brian, so.. hmm. I'd like to think Clay could have won over one of Ted/Helen/Jan if he'd REALLY reamed into Brian but I'm not sure.Oh man. I have a friend I make fun of the show with, we tend to say stupid shit we can see the show doing, and this is, like, exactly something we'd come up with.Tied with one other Springsten song for my absolute favorite song ever. Just... fucking unbelievable.^^Confession: ^^I've ^^never ^^actually ^^seen ^^this ^^movie.&gt;"I wanted to make the greatest rock record that I'd ever heard. I wanted it to sound enormous, to grab you by your throat and insist that you take that ride, insist that you pay attention - not just to the music, but to life, to being alive."The two songs that are tied for my absolute favorite.. though the title track off this album might be right up there next to them, too.. either way, those three are fucking amazing - truly *amazing* songs that outclass, just... everything I've heard, ever. And they both are on the same album and fit this theme. Listening to this one again just now, even after hearing it countless times before, it still almost brought me to tears just for the sheer fucking... intensity and excellence of it.Great theme.Niiiiiiiiiiiice submission. Always one of my absolute favorite favorite *favorites* by them, my favorite off this album next to Famous Last Words, and I might even prefer it to that one even if the latter is better. Criminally underrated, no other MCR fans I know care about this one and I don't get that at all, it's so amazing.Really pretty song. I like this one a lot. Nice submission.AccurateGreat song by one of my all-time favorite bands.Yess, it so is. And I love what an incredibly fucking *big* song it is while also being so desolate... amazing. Seriously one of the best things they ever put out, maybe top 2 or 3 of their whole discography for me, but definitely one of the best at least.If you just beat the Elite Four 365 times and then talk to Bill, he'll tell you the S.S. Anne has come back and he wants you to take his ticket again. If you go for him, beat it, then come back, he'll let you into the Secret Garden behind his house where you can catch Pikablu and all the other Pok\u00e9Gods!Dried paint is the shit. When I was eleven and we were painting the walls in my new bedroom, some of the paint was left out in a little container on the floor. I was laying on the floor watching TV and started poking at it absent-mindedly with my big toe, and I ended up poking through it to the wet paint below, and I got paint all over my toes but didn't even care because it felt soooo good. Just imagine poking through that stuff in this gif to a bunch of cool liquid underneath. Fucking awesome.Oh fuuck I forgot sticky notes like that were a thing. They were hot shit in middle school iirc.Hanging a childI don't think he's boring. Just irrelevant. He doesn't show up enough to bore me.

And he has cool feathers.Oh man does he? I made a post recently about her being one of the weakest characters and wish I'd remembered that. What bugs me most is how she never gets a single line of dialogue throughout the entire series....both. :(To them those weren't mistakes. The vaaaast majority of viewers don't know the winner can be obvious and don't care about an edit like his.We did get less of that this week once she wasn't at the center of a vote.I'd like to lose Joe. I don't mind him but he isn't really adding anything *good,* so it'd keep my favorites around a little longer. I'd be okay with losing Stephen, loved him in Tocantins but his second iteration has way disappointed me, and I'd *love* to lose Spencer who still does nothing for me despite all his air time. I mean when it came time to emotionally open up to a tribemate, the only thing Spencer had in his tank was "I don't really get emotional."Ooh, that is another excellent point.

On /r/HPRankdown a few other fans and I are going through and eliminating/writing about characters one at a time to make a list of which ones we think are the best. Marietta was the first one I cut, [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/3g7tp2/marietta_edgecombe/)If I tried to start a \#Gays4Savage hashtag, I wonder whether that would catch on at all...Just the Reddit username of one of the other rankers in that project.Thank you very much! Strategy isn't why I watch but I do like analyzing shit. But it's never really what I look for in a contestant or a season.Really chill German song with a neat video. First heard it in middle school and had a big adolescent crush on the singer.At the part near the bottom of the weekly update where you say what % are still standing, I'd be interested in also knowing which % of pre-premiere or post-premiere are still standing.Composed for the soundtrack to the fucking awesome 1998 PlayStation game Spyro the Dragon. It appears in a fantasy world, so it does sound fairly whimsical - but that world is the penultimate one of the game, and it plays during the level that ends in a boss fight, so it also feels kind of imposing and adventurous, since it's at such a convoluted and challenging level so close to the end of the game. Really captures the spirit of the level perfectly.

He later released it under the title "Rain" - but that's one word, too!Whoa. This is fucking incredible.

I stumbled upon one song of theirs a few months ago, Carolyn's Fingers, and loved it. This one was unexpectedly heavier and was also amazing.

I don't know anything else that sounds quite like them. This is really good stuff.Oh wow, I'm really surprised to see Nagini out this early, actually, and I'm disappointed. Not Stone level disappointed because she doesn't belong more than ~50 places either way, but I think she's a really memorable quasi-antagonist, she adds a lot to Voldy and is just generally more effective than I'd expect a possibly cliche giant-ass evil snake to be. I always kinda liked Nagini and I think she's way cool and fairly integral to the story so I wish she'd gone a little further. A little.Yeah that's another thing that makes me wish Nagini had stayed a little longer. She's a vehicle for some really important Harry stuff. His early OotP angst is annoying and just him being 15, but when you get to shit like that it's a lot more intense and I feel really bad for him dealing with all that. I would like to use my Invisibility Cloak on smilesbotWould have been my next cut. Does her job well and it's a pretty excellent job, but it's a very very short-lived and inconsequential one. She adds to the story by showing that the entire wizarding populace aren't all buying the Ministry's stuff and showing there's resistance even outside the Order or D.A., and I admire her for that on a personal level as well, but she's so minor that she doesn't need to last longer. Her name very clearly stands out as a minor character so I feared she might go early. I'm happy she made it this far for her contributions, however small they may have been.Do we know canonically that the Carrows were OG Death Eaters? It's possible they only joined moldy Voldy during the second War.

Good points that he appears sort of out of thin air and I can't really imagine what he'd have done before, though. It would have been neat to have him as a minor character somehow in the first few books.

That said, while the Carrows were on my list in the near future, I thought a lot about cutting them before and decided against it, and I wish they'd maybe gone a teeensy bit further. One-dimensional, sure, but I reaaally dig their dimension. The Carrows' reign of terror at Hogwarts was one of the most shocking and evocative parts of the series for me, and I think it's as low as things ever get throughout all seven books. I mean, it's *Hogwarts.* The magical land of moving staircases and funny talking paintings and giant squids and funny wizard classes that we all fell in love with and found so charming as kids (or at least most of us were probably kids.) It's such an OTTP land of innocence and, above all else, *security,* which is established even more throughout the series. We're told there's no safer place than Hogwarts, that no matter what happens the bad guys can't get into *Hogwarts.* It feels like a second home for me and probably a bunch of other readers.

And then the Carrows completely twist and warp that. I mean they fucking *torture children.* At *Hogwarts.* Hogwarts was always a place with at least some security, that was established for nearly six books (even when Umbridge is there and corrupts Hogwarts in her own way, she at least isn't a Death Eater doing it, just an awful person; Hogwarts still remains safe from Voldy et al.), but the Carrows completely smash that security into the tiniest little pieces and stomp it into the dirt. It's horrific, wonderfully awfully horrific.

And it's very important that they exist: after Dumbledore dies, we can't just go back to pretending Hogwarts is all happy and safe. We *need* fallout like the Carrows for Dumbledore's death to mean as much as it does and exist as a complete game-changer rather than just a big moment; things can't just shift to other Order members taking control and teaching the same classes - things need to go awful, and it's hard to get more awful than the Carrows.

I don't object to the cut at this stage, since we don't really *see* any of this due to point of view limitations and since, as you pointed out, they really do appear out of nowhere. So I'm fine with losing both of the Carrows, and Amycus certainly had to go very soon after Alecto did, and none of this is to say the cut is wrong or anything - I'd probably have cut them myself in the very near future. But I do really appreciate the sickening twist they bring to the series and didn't want the emotional weight and necessity of the Carrows to go unnoticed in this project.

Never thought I'd be making a pro-Carrow comment. That's why this is fun!That's the one that protects the bot!Neckman probably would.Kimmi Kappenberg. What the actual fuck.Oh my gosh, the way he keeps saying "(if this is True)", and the way he corrects "I'd like to say" to "I'd **LOVE** to say." This video is greatHe says the soap is "doubloons" so I figured he meant not to drop them because they were valuable.Hells yeah.lol holy fuckMy friend and I still regularly quote "BE HOT, BE NAUGHTY, BE COURTEOUS" to each other.Oh yeah, me neither. Very surprising but a very pleasant surprise.Awesome, thanks! It says pre-premiere for both, though.Wow, that's fantastic. I'm amazed they posted it. Really happy they did, though, that's great.Steve saluting PhillipSO

FUCKING

EXCITING

HOLY SHIT

my heart rate increased just reading that commentMy opinion of Vytas is the exact same and I'm happy he was out first.["High on You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4m1_c_ZKGc) is utterly magical.[Goodbye Skupin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSP7kxuyYok) from Australia episode six is the only one I really know outside of Ancient Voices (my favorite iteration of which was def. Africa's.) Used brilliantly in the episode and great on its own. I put it on repeat after the Red Wedding. :("We were like legless chickens... running after sleek weasels..." oh my *god* ace shut up. I love him. I wouldn't want to see him back because I think he works best as a short-term character but my god what a surreal contestant I love him.Ashley Trainer, Cristina Coria, Clarence Black.Richard conveniently decided to tell everyone he was gay the night of the first Tribal Council. Stacey's alliance didn't want to take him out right after he'd opened up like that, so they switched the vote to Rudy. I think Sue would have voted with them to take out Rich otherwise and he'd have gone home, but it's possible she was always voting Souna, I don't know for sure.Wow how in the fuck did I type that many words about John Dawlish.

/u/AmEndevomTag u next xoxoYes it did!! well less that comment and more thinking about the whole thing, seeing the picture and thinking about the moment and watching it for the first time and everything &lt;3 It's exciting to think about someone watching that episode for the first time

Keep in mind that that is *by far* my favorite thing ever on the show ever, so like take all the enjoyment you get out of, like, 80% of all the things that have ever happened on the show then put it into one thing and that's how I feel about that episode.

Sometimes after a long day at work I just want to get excited about Survivor: Marquesas and that *is* how I relax is that so wrongIt can be both.

Production's goal is to make (what they consider) the best TV show they can make, nothing else. The candidates to go home were Spencer, a very popular contestant from a very recent season and open favorite of at least one executive producer; Kelly, another open production favorite and the very first person they called out at the reunion show, because she's a relic not only of when Survivor itself was a massive force in pop culture but of its *apex* (the first FTC + Sue's speech); and Monica, someone who got a small edit on a season near the middle of the show's history whom Probst openly didn't expect to see in the final cast.

When we have two contestants who are big favorites of the producers and whose victories would benefit the show (Spencer for being so popular and recent; Kelly for being so old from when Survivor was at its peak) and one whose victory would be much harder to market, and when they can ask as many leading questions as they want in the interviews without ever getting into trouble for it... what incentive do they have to *not* try and get rid of Monica? They care far more about the television product than they do about the "integrity" of the game, so frankly, I think they'd be stupid not to.

Maybe that's not why Monica went home, we really have no way of knowing, but the idea of it still makes sense regardless of whether she's upset.Rigging is a stronger word, I think. They can push for a particular outcome without outright rigging to ensure it (regardless of whether they did that.)Maybe she's right, maybe she's wrong, I don't know, I wasn't out there and I don't have an opinion either way - but we *are* watching a manufactured TV show and it's good to remember that, at least. And it's intriguing to see it brought up. I'd be interested in seeing her do another AMA, maybe after the season so she can talk about more events and potentially so emotions about the outcome could cool down a little bit, in case she might be willing to elaborate more by then. It'd be interesting to hear more details.Jonas kinda disappointed me on the rewatch. He was a lot more dull and I remembered.

But that was balanced out by almost everyone else being marginally less dull than I remembered.Keith couldn't make rice.Kel got caught with beef jerky.I think I want this played at my funeralYes, you should wait.It would kind of spoil Ozzy's. It also features the relative of a contestant from season 19/20.&gt;how she seizes Tyrion when it's clearly a BAD IDEA

I don't agree that it was, given the information she had. There's another post out there that provides a [good general overview](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/92245-catnapping-a-psa/) of it but considering Catelyn's belief in a Lannister conspiracy that would endanger her family - a belief that came from sources who we as readers with more information know were b.s.ing her but who *she* had every reason to trust - it was the best choice she could have made once Marillion called Tyrion and he recognized her. Obviously the ideal outcome is Tyrion never sees her, but once he did... she already had every reason to believe the Lannisters were a danger, and now one of them sees her out and about on incredibly covert business? That's nothing but bad news; all she can do is try to gain an upper hand.

Clearly a bad idea to us, but things were unclear to her, so from her perspective it was the right call after he recognized her.Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think Catelyn made the moon tea connection herself, and I'm certain she didn't make the Lysa connection because that's totally new to us in the fucking trip that is ASOS Sansa VII.Jon will be resurrected by Melisandre then killed again the exact same way and his second death will end the series&gt;Rhaegar snapped out of his daydream; he had being staring at the Northern girl. "Best stay away from that one." He muttered.

Snow castle -&gt; LF being a creep -&gt; castle destroyed -&gt; fantaaastic rising tension w/ Sansa + Lysa -&gt; tons of backstory -&gt; **FUCKING JON ARRYN REVEAL HOLY SHIT WHAT THE FUCK** -&gt; things start to calm down -&gt; "ONLY CAT" WHAT THE FUCK HE JUST FUCKING DID HE SERIOUSLY NO FUCKING WHAT -&gt; "This singer's just killed my lady wife" WHAAAT.

Chapter goes in a fucking insane amount of directions and all of them are perfect.Yup, it's a *perfect* final sentence. Shows us how unbelievably cold LF is, but it's also Marillion getting his much-needed comeuppance, which makes LF's coldness hilarious.An autobiography is different since that's something they're profiting from. Monica probably wouldn't be supposed to go into a ton of depth in an AMA, but maybe she could go into more than in this higher profile exit interview, or maybe she'd say "screw it" and go into depth anyway - I mean, Luara from her first season constantly posted blogs saying that Hantz had Idols handed to him in Samoa, and they brought her back after it, so who knows how strictly they enforce some of that stuff. Probably depends how extreme it is and how much truth to it there is I guess.Did he sing about his chocolate salty balls?I really, really disagree honestly. Not just because of "Your sister" but splitting up the reveal and Lysa death takes so much weight away from it, removing the scapegoat makes Littlefinger a tooootal idiot, and the whole thing just felt so rushed. I was really disappointed by the whole thing. It barely felt like a big thing at all, whereas in the books it was, like, the biggest of all the big things.Yup, the implications re: Sansa are chilling and the whole thing is just an unparalleled mindfuck that makes you need to re-read the whole series (and then you realize how many hints there were all along.) The back end of ASOS is mindfuck after mindfuck after mindfuck after mindfuck, then that's the one to top them all.Yup, it starts off seeming kind of like Bran's final chapter in ACOK - a melancholy reflection on the fate of the Starks - but then it shoots in so many other directions as well.I actually basically dreamt that two nights ago, haha. My dream two nights ago consisted entirely of trying to listen to Downbound Train but perpetually getting interrupted and having to start over. I listened to it as soon as possible after waking up, maybe about 20 minutes after I woke up, and it was fucking heavenly.Top ten, definitely not, but I rank it a lot higher than I think most people do. I'm pretty sure a lot of people weren't crazy about that song, and it *is* a little weird as an opening track, but man I think it's awesome. I think its story is really effective and really enjoyable to listen to.

I'm a lot bigger on WOAD in general than I think most fans are, but it was also my second Bruce album (18 Tracks was my first) so maybe that's why, the whole upbeat playfulness of it really isn't jarring to me and I think it's a very solid album even if it's not *as* great as the other things he's put out over the years.They'd be more even but less accurate. Multiple Cagayan contestants all getting a solid amout of focus means Cagayan is getting more focus. This season does feel pretty Cagayan-heavy to me so I'm not surprised to see it represented there.OHMYGOSH THANK YOU YOU HAVE GIVEN ME AN AMAZING GIFT &gt;"This merge is going to be intense. Ogakor will be relieved. I think that they'll -- I mean, I think they're good people, and I think that they're gonna feel bad and sincerely have compassion for us and for Mike. But they weren't part of that, they didn't experience it, they didn't... hear it. And so that feeling of 'Oh my goodness' -- it's gonna have to be very quickly replaced with relief that we're merging together, 'cause we had them. We had 'em. They had to have been scared, they had to have been afraid. There was no way we were losing this challenge today -- no way. And... we're gonna.. we're gonna kill 'em. We're gonna eat 'em up, and we're gonna spit 'em up, and that's the way Mike would want it to be. It was the last thing he said to us before he left, and it's exactly what we're gonna do."

I checked out the [PlayStation Underground Jampack disc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwB7XSiOiMU&amp;t=2m47s) that I had as a kid but it featured different games than you mentioned and looked different, so unless your memories are way off, that isn't it.

Those are fun memories to have with your grandparents! I have some similar ones for other games. And of course many Spyro memories with other relatives.But I'm a Hufflepuff!&gt;Once people know you as a player, it is so much harder to not get voted off.

Looking at the Greatest Hits track listing (assuming it's [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Hits_(Bruce_Springsteen_album))) it already has two of the best songs off BTR, but it doesn't even have either of my two personal favorites. I would prioritize the hell out of BTR. And then Darkness very soon after that."Boring" is one of the last adjectives I'd ever expect to see used for Espada.Actually fucking applauded just now when I read this comment. FUCKING LOVE Wyman Manderly! Fuck yeah!!!!Fuck yeah! He's my second favorite in the entire series.Catelyn.Installed the Freeze Cheat after CrystalFissure's gif yesterday, and I tried a buuunch of convoluted stuff with that to airswim here.

None of that was fruitful, but after over an hour straight of all that, I thought of something much simpler: just use SpyroEdit's "Attraction" feature to bring Zoe over by the pool, and then use the same method as in Dino Mines or [this Summer Forest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aiRGQ5kTog), keeping her above ground but having her zap you while she's underwater.

The hardest part was getting her there, since the only Zoe here is right before the tall tower you glide from to get the orb, and there's a whirlwind taking up the entire width of the little tower you reach her from, and using the Attraction feature near it gets funky and can permanently trap you by the ceiling, while trying to Repel it away makes you fall down the tower with the whirlwind gone and no way to get back up (and if you die so you respawn, everything's position resets.) So what you have to do is attract Zoe over the edge of the wall, falling down to where you buy Shady Oasis from Moneybags, then go backwards through the hall (past Magma Cone, Fracture Hills, Scorch) to bring her outside. The Attraction Stare is helpful to get her following you without as many other things (though I still eventually picked up the Professor and couldn't get rid of his [rather fitting] "AHA! ....no....")

Teeny tiny obstacle by the set of ladders where you first climb into the castle: it's easier to have Attraction on instead of the Attraction Stare, but if you use that you'll end up attracting the portal to Summer Forest (and Winter Tundra if you've unlocked it.) So you need to turn off Attraction, jump down there, turn on Repulsion to get rid of the portals, then climb back up and Attract her.

I could try to post a video of it but it's pretty straightforward, albeit cumbersome. Just turn on Attraction and drag Zoe over to the pool, then turn it off and proceed as you would in Dino Mines, and make sure you repel the Forest/Tundra portals and bypass the whirlwind by going through the Moneybags/Shady Oasis area.

There are already a couple ways to swim in air in Autumn Plains, but here's another!I disagree, at least for the first part. If you remember the names of every contestant, you can still remember one's existence without knowing anything about them.I can't really defend One World as *good,* but I don't think it's *that* bad either. To me it's the portrait of mediocrity. It's the one season in the history of Survivor where I don't think the franchise really is better or worse off without it. I think the show's better with the seasons I rank above it (and even one I rank below it), I think it's weaker with most of the ones below, but One World? Eh, could take or leave it.

That isn't really a glowing endorsement but it's a lot less negative than most people on here feel towards it (because I *don't* feel negatively towards it; I feel, like, baaarely positive.) I think it has some pretty decent episodic stuff going on most of the time - though where it especially suffers for me is the total lack of long-term storylines or deep contestants to get invested in; it's a lot of weekly gamebotting that sets up that vote-off and nothing else. But still, I think those individual weeks often contain some good stuff. I think there's some alright content with the One World twist in the first few episodes, episode four does have some engaging dynamnics, the fallout around Jonas's boot is pretty fun, and after Mike/Jay are out, I get a solid amount of entertainment out of Troyzan perpetually pissing off everyone around him by being... well, Troy - because you also get the commentary of people like Sabrina. And I fucking hate Kat so it's fun to watch her get slaughtered.

I don't know, I'm already kind of bored of talking about it, and "Half the episodes are pretty okay" isn't high praise but it's better than I can give to a fair amount of other seasons. But I think Troyzan's pretty fun to laugh at, I love Bill for an early boot, and I think Sabrina/Chelsea are strong characters. Past them I pretty much mildly like most of the cast. Like I'm not really invested in Kim or Christina or Jay or Mike or Nina, but eh, I think they all brought *some* okay stuff. I can remember a few things I liked about most of the cast which really is more than I can say for other seasons.

It's still not great or really even particularly good, because Colton exists and the back to back Mike/Jay episodes are brutal, which makes like half of the season barely worth watching if at all. But I think the annoying stuff in half the episodes and mildly okay stuff in the other half of the episodes balance out to make it, like, not *bad.* But if you can't stand Troyzan then yeah there's probably virtually nothing there for you. I just like to laugh at him and that makes the post-merge sort of okay to me.Fiji. It has a lot of bad or boring stuff that drags it down for me, but I'm still happy it's a season that exists for Dreamz, Earl, and Yau-Man. Not totally worth it while watching but the bad stuff isn't *that* bad that it makes me wish the season weren't a thing.You're quite welcome, enjoy!Name who came in any place (1-16/18/19/20) for any season of Survivor (1-30).For Borneo, half of Pagong not getting any air time in the premiere.

Weird line from an otherwise fucking fantaaastic song and high point of an excellent album. This song just builds and builds into insanity.WYMAN FUCKING MANDERLY

Because the NORTH FUCKING REMEMBERS and will bake your deceptive ass into a fucking pie and serve you to your family.

Because he's the exact character you want to exist after the Red Wedding in the body of a morbidly obese man. Diehard Stark loyalism plus cannibalism plus talking like a fucking mob boss ("They infest my city like roaches...") plus so many chins you can't even cut his throat.

Because he's Wyman fucking Manderly. It doesn't need more explanation than that.I see it as kind of a grey thing, where she's an underdog but she's only an underdog because her alliance sucked so hard.Edmure is such an adorable MagikarpYes, he took his time while they were holding his son hostage after murdering his other one *and* his king at the Red Wedding. I'm not sure what you wish he had done differently.&gt;he's probably the most "one of us" out of any winner there ever was.

That doesn't mean you have to root for him. I just go off someone's character on the show and I didn't like his. I don't know why, with Cochran in particular out of every contestant in the show's history, people who don't dislike him always feel the need to say "Oh it's just jealousy" and act like people's actual explanations of their problems with him are "excuses." It doesn't happen with basically any other contestant, definitely not on the same level. Maybe people just did not like the same traits in him that you liked.If you're hating him as an edited TV character and not a human being, then yeah that's totally valid.Oh man this should be a fun account&gt;He has made so many great plays, flipped so many votes, dominated so many "better" players.

The crux of the "Russell outright sucks" argument, whether you agree with it or not, is that those things don't matter if his shot at winning the jury vote is 0. Not making that argument here but that's what that argument *is,* so bringing up those things isn't totally relevant.

Also not really cool to say people who disagree with you are completely unfair fools.&gt;it introduced us to so many returning players

That has literally nothing to do with the quality of the season and everything to do with who producers wanted back. If those contestants were good in Cook Islands, that stands based on Cook Islands alone, not based off of future seasons.I never got why people hated Missy/Baylor so much but I think it's subsided since then. I'm not really sure why Lisa Whelchel is so reviled and I thought her personal story was the best post-Matsing part of Philippines, and I think people really don't give enough credit to Lillian for shaping Pearl Islands into what it was. It's hard to say someone *shouldn't* be hated since different people watch for different things, but I never *got* the Baylor/Missy/Lisa hatred, and Lill is someone I think is frequently misunderstood.I mean look how easy it is to turn this around though:

&gt;I am not saying that if you disagree with me you are a fool, I am saying that if you think Russell is one of the top 50 players ever than you are a fool. There have been so, so few worse players than Russell to play the game. I am not saying he is the worst by any means but he is so far from the best that it really illuminates either extreme bias or a serious lack of intelligence to think he is a top tier player.
 
Diving into "You're an unintelligent, extremely biased, unfair, complete fool" doesn't really get us anywhere or prove you right in any way. That comment says nothing other than that you don't respect people who have an opinion you don't have about a reality TV contestant, which seems a little harsh.Thank you!Missy's religious or political beliefs and Lisa's political beliefs never came up on the show, and people don't seem to old that against Ciera, Luara, Kimmi... even Frank, whose political beliefs certainly came up on the show.But you seem to imply that not doing so means people are jealous.Hmm. How?Yeah I dunno. I guess I thought she was a good narrator with good content so it resonated differently with us, which is fair. I didn't know if she had any particular traits that actively bugged you or anything so I guess she just landed with me more than with you.I honestly love the design of this sub. It's simple but it still feels effective and distinct from other subs in a sort of Spyro-y way. So yeah I'm all for simple changes.I'm gonna just exit this conversation I guess, because I'm really not sure how to talk to someone who's convinced that their individual view of things is "objective reality" and it's absolutely impossible for anyone to see it differently. Different people have different takes on him as a player, and disagreeing is one thing but saying "I *am* right, this *is* reality, and if you think anything different, you're a blind and biased fool!" seems like a very stubborn and arrogant approach that I don't know how to engage with.No yeah I definitely agree he did some good stuff and some stuff that wasn't bad. But I do not think that those things are relevant if he was still not going to win any jury vote in any universe, as I believe to be the case, as far as we can possibly tell. But I'm not really interested in who the definitive worst player is because I don't think we can possibly know, since ultimately that would mean having to debate the merits of Chicken vs. Michelle vs. Carolina. Basically the one player I think you could concretely argue *is* the worst is Sleckman, because she's physically unable to win Survivor for medical reasons and should never have been on the show in the first place, but other than that total anomaly I don't see much purpose in looking for "the worst player ever"; I just think Hantz is as good a candidate as any other because delaying a loss is meaningless to me if it doesn't actually improve your odds of winning.It's just kind of a pet peeve of mine, because it comes up a *lot* in Cochran conversations and I don't really get why people often jump to it. I don't know what people say or do that suggests they're jealous of him. But for my personal reasoning, to provide an alternative, in South Pacific:

* It seemed like he felt entitled right off the bat to success or special treatment because he was a big fan. Wanting to do well because you're a fan is one thing, but he seemed affronted that people would target him for being a physical detriment to the tribe, something he should have expected rather than taking personally.

* Gave a pretty sexist confessional about how being male apparently makes him stronger in challenges than women.

* Passing the time with stories about creepy voicemails he left girls in his class about semen, crapping his pants, and herpes. That's three different times in a few episodes where he tried to be funny with things that were just weird and gross.

* The confessional where he tried to do an impression of a gangster.

* The confessional where he said "I'm a mastermind, but not an *evil* mastermind."

* Then after all of this... he flips to avoid a rock and it backfires in the most predictable fashion imaginable. Making a bad strategic move doesn't really make him likable or unlikable - but when he acts like a gangster, calls himself a "mastermind", says he's "the most Survivor-savvy player EVER"... all of those things already feel pretty unfounded and annoying, but then he outright drops the ball on all of them by making one of the most elementary mistakes possible.

* Complained at FTC about how there would probably be a "bitter jury."

So he talked himself up and presented him as *the most savvy mastermind in Survivor history* (in his words, not mine), then within one episode was taking it personally that people didn't view him the same way he viewed himself, and then after talking himself up, he completely floundered. He seemed like someone who hyped himself up based on very little and then failed to live up to his own self-constructed image.

...and also said women are weak, "bitter juries" suck, and jokes about semen, herpes, and feces.

If he was built up as more of a villain, then maybe it could have worked. It could have been conceptually interesting to see someone who should have it all put together on paper but then watch as all of that is totally deconstructed in reality, and I kind of want to appreciate him in that light.. but the stance the edit instead took was that we were supposed to agree with his baseless hype and pump our fists at his awful move because nothing makes you more of a victim than strangers not responding well to your jizz stories.

In Caramoan, he bugged me a lotttt less and I actually liked him as a background confessionalist during the pre-merge, but in the latter stages of the game it once again felt like he was buying into his own hype and, in any case, the constant praise and hype of the edit and imbalance of the screen time got incredibly annoying.

So I hope this maybe helps you understand where I am coming from on this. He irked me a lot for two seasons so seeing people just go "People who dislike Cochran are probably jealous" is very annoying because, no, it's that entire list of reasons. Buuut probably I should have opened with those reasons to begin with, and I overlooked the part of your post where you said you weren't sure why people have such a problem with him, and it makes sense you might go to othe things if you didn't mind Cochran and haven't seen people really explain why they did. So hopefully this helped. &lt;3Yeah I don't like the money thing at all because that's irrelevant to the actual game with its goal of winning. I don't think what cash prizes the producers choose to give out really have any relevance to skill in the game itself. So to me someone who goes out early and someone who makes it far but are never going to win are even, at least as far as we can possibly know unless we bring back Chicken Morris to see whether it's possible for him to be a jury threat, but let's not do that.

But early boots and pre-mergers could maybe get pushed forward by a strong tribe like Katie or Caryn (who turned out to also suck socially, but that's beside the point.) People who will always be targeted in the endgame like Cirie could get a final challenge or two that play to their strengths. But there is no way to work around just being an unlikable dickweed who won't get the jury votes, short of lightning striking the other two contestants.Yeah, different strokes n stuff. People outright *hating* her is what I don't get quite as much.That's fair and that ties more to CI, then. The fact that they returned is different than the fact that they were in your opinion good characters who deserved to return. Which might be semantics but if they suddenly brought back all of Ometepe that doesn't mean RI is retroactively a good season, Monica Culpepper isn't a bigger or better character than John Carroll, etc.Eliminating them would be silly but I wouldn't mind seeing them shortened a little to make room for more character development.I like this live version better than the original album version. Fun song. Big, dumb, fun song. Basically what I'd expect or want from KISS.Oops. Didn't even realize he was still in. Yeah, necessary character so Ginny dates someone else, but definitley should not have made it this far.Hestia Jones meets Tom the Barman. Appropriate placement and write-up.John Kenney, maybe.Yeah I think a lot of it is just that one weird, obnoxious guy who doesn't change his flair and posts too much.Get revenge on them by burning the shelter down and, when interviewed about it, giving responses so dry they make Carter look like Chris.Will only do it for seasons I'm comfortable answering it about, and will try to keep it as spoiler-free as possible.

**Australia:** Trial by Fire, E6/F11. Every single scene adds something excellent to the episode, even before the climax. I mean, this is also the episode with Jerri and Amber's chocolate orgasms. Basically every time I watch it I get some surprise of "Oh my god, I forgot *that* was also in this episode! Hell yeah!" Every scene is great, including probably the single best Reward Challenge in Survivor history. And *then* you get to the last ~25% of this episode, and an already fantastic episode just skyrockets into unbelievable territory with some of the most indescribable, shocking, powerful content in the history of the show, which was set up SO unbelievably well in the wider story of the episode, too. Survivor storytelling at its absolute best and a climax that's among the 2 or 3 best moments in Survivor history make this an absolute top-tier episode; the fact that every other scene is also wildly entertaining with an all-time great Reward Challenge make it the single best episode in the history of the show, bar none.

**Marquesas:** Jury's Out, E8/F9. The climax of the single greatest storyline in Survivor history, and really of an inter-season storyline that goes all the way back to the very first individual TC. This is the episode everybody wanted from Rattana's first vote reveal, this is the ultimate game-changer in the entire history of post-Borneo Survivor, and within just this season and episode it's still set up utterly perfectly. Very honorable mentions for No Pain, No Gain (ep.3), True Lies (ep.7), A Tale of Two Cities (F5), and The Sole Survivor (F4).

**Thailand:** Probably Sleeping With The Enemy, E8/F9. Really weird situation for an episode after the F10 twist and some really beautiful, emotional post-IC content. But there are valid complaints that they didn't really explain the vote at *all* and some people think the emotional content suffers from the lack of focus those contestants got previously (on that point I disagree, at least as far as an evaluation of *this* episode is concerned), so I'd also throw in Assumptions, E9/F10. Weird-ass anomaly of an episode but an incredibly entertaining one that tells its isolated story very well. The producers got playful in this season and nowhere more than there. One of my favorite twists ever.

**Pearl Islands:** Basically the entire fucking season

**All-Stars:** Shark Attack, E3. Kind of a weird outcome to the episode in theory but in practice the producers handled it so well and so delicately that I think it's great, evocative television, and prior to all that you have some fucking hilarious stuff that basically fit into exactly what the season was supposed to be.

**Vanuatu:** Surprise and... Surprise Again!, F7. Vanuatu is a fantastic season that blends character, story, and strategy brilliantly - the game is complex, but it arises from actual conflicts between the contestants based on their individual personalities and values - and that's at its best here in an *incredibly* satisfying episode. Probably even better on a second viewing, which I think I'd also say for Jury's Out and Trial By Fire, come to think of it.

**Palau:** The Ultimate Shock, finale. Everything I would ever want Survivor to be. Can't even begin to explain without spoiling. If you haven't seen this and especially if you have not heard how Palau ends, watch this shit. Palau is amazing and every second of it is building up to this. Big honorable mentions for Exile Island, F8, and... gah, I can't remember the name of the F6 episode, but that one. 

**Panama:** For Cod's Sake!!!, episode 5. Casaya &lt;3

**China:** That's Love, Baby! Make You Strong!, episode 6. Can't say as much here because I'm not quite as invested in China or this episode as some of the others on the list, but last time I watched China I remembered this as a defffffinite highlight. This episode has an excellent story that builds and builds perfectly to a marvelous Immunity Challenge with pretty big implications for the season going forward. Actually the only episode in Survivor that's ever made me hesitate and wonder if the show is scripted just because it plays out so freaking well.

**Micronesia:** The whole post-merge is pretty fucking fantastic up to the finale but my top pick, which is exceptionally hard to discuss without spoiling, is that episode. *That* one. You know the one I mean. (...if you don't, because this post-merge is so good, I mean [this one.](http://static.tvtome.com/images/genie_images/story/Erik1.jpg))

**Gabon:** Apple in the Garden of Eden, E7/F10. Legendary episode for meta fanbase reasons, but even aside from that, it's pretty damn surprising on a first viewing, it's hilarious, it's immensely satisfying. One of my absolute favorite outcomes to an episode, especially for the latter half of this show's run.

**Tocantins:** The Martyr Approach, F5. See title. \*eagle screeches\*

**Heroes vs. Villains:** Slay Everyone, Trust No One, premiere. Actually even better than I expected on a rewatch because god damn there's some foreshadowing out the ass for the rest of the season here, but it's also just a hella entertaining collection of interactions between entertaining and familiar faces. Great example of everything returning player seasons should be. I like to say that in Pearl Islands, the producers and contestants seemingly worked together to create the best damn collection of episodes possible (and succeeded wildly); here, it feels like they worked together to create one of the best premieres ever. That opening sets up the season to be SO fantastically big, and the rest of the episode delivers wildly due to the cast.

**Nicaragua:** Maybe an unpopular pick but I think You Started, You're Finishing, F9, was a really, really dramatic and satisfying episode. Totally a weird anomaly of an episode, not just in this season but really in much of Survivor history ("Exile Island" from Palau is the only thing that can compare to it), but I think that its sort of weird structure and narrow focus allow a LOT of care to be crafted to that one story, and I feel incredibly satisfied walking away from this episode. ...Actually, wait, I just remembered the second episode exists, and I'm going to change my answer to that because holylol fucking Nicaragua &lt;3

**Philippines:** Create A Little Chaos, E4. There's like 0 competition here, this episode blows almost all of post-HvV Survivor completely out of the fucking water, let alone this season. Absolutely stellar and beautiful cold open that builds perfectly to probably my all-time favorite tribal Immunity Challenge in the entire history of the show. Like Trial By Fire, all three tribes are at their best here with consistently engaging content, but then that climax just shaaaaatters everything else to where I forget how fun the rest of it actually was, too.

**Pearl Islands:** The whole fucking season. It needs to be said twice. My god Pearl Islands is fucking amazing. &lt;333

**Cagayan:** Hot Girl With A Grudge, pt.2, because... my god. Just.. fucking hilarious. The merge episode is a great pick, they're probably about even for me but I'd give the second half of the premiere the edge because I am just so in love with all the batshit fucking shenanigans that go down there. I feel like Hot Girl is sort of 2 episodes that just have one title, but if you want to view it all as one episode then it's still my pick because the first hour was also pretty fun. But the second hour is fantastic.

**Worlds Apart:** We're Finally Playing Some Survivor, E5. Worlds Apart reaaally didn't land with me a lot of the time, but this? This was a beautiful, hilarious hour of television. It felt almost like something out of Nicaragua. &lt;3Probst visits Ta Keo because the production camp was struck by lightning and burned down, so they need Joe to make another. He builds the producers a 5-star resort in roughly four and a half minutes using nothing but three toothpicks and a foot of dental floss, and those first four minutes were just him doing Joega to wake himself up.I've never seen it so I'm neither for nor against."bi" means 2 and "pan" means all. Pansexual specifically means that you're also attracted to people who are transgender, genderqueer, etc.

I'm just a dude who likes dudes that have dudebodies. It is a very simple life. But other people's orientations might be less simple, so different, less common terms may be right for them, and it don't hurt me any what label they feel fits them best, so I don't really care what they identify as, and they certainly know their own feelings better than I do so I wouldn't say that they're "trying to make [themselves] feel different."Romantic and sexual orientation aren't always the same, so you could totally be panromantic heterosexual or something. For almost everyone they're aligned and synonymous, though, myself included.The only sexual orientation that also makes you a member of KISS.It's pretty common, at least as far as I can tell from the two asexual people I'm friends with.&gt;I love that I have a label for myself, and I'm happy you have one for you too.

I wish more people took this approach to things.Springsteen. Lots of *The River* earlier, just now listened through *Working on a Dream* but it just finished so now it's time for bed, because if I don't stop myself now I'll be awake for another, like, 45 minutes just so I can keep listening to Springsteen. Especially since there's so much better Springsteen than those two albums and it's been, like, 4 or 5 days since I've heard most of *Darkness on the Edge of Town*, which is way too long... Yeah I need to go to bed right this second or I'll end up listening through *Darkness*.Hopefully a factory-sealed copy of the first Spyro the Dragon, if I'm lucky and one turns up...Lately, "I want to go to bed but I don't want to stop listening to Springsteen"SJDS has so many high points I didn't even know which one to pick. Those two and the first jury ep all came to mind. And episode four.Hells yeah!! I'd been busy lately so I hadn't had time to work on a write-up for this so sorry on it all falling on you. I will contribute my thoughts more later.The name "Nicolas Flamel" as a part of the story is kind of a nostalgic book 1 thing and he fits his non-existent role there pretty well but clearly didn't need to stay. Alongside Tom the Barman, Griselda Marchbanks, Trevor, Dedalus, etc., he's a great cut to finish up this month.Once or twice I thought to myself, "What would South Pacific have been like without Sophie?" And then I feel empty and cold and clammy all over as all my hot blood runs and flees from my body at such a cold, dark thought.Yes! Those druids are the first ones I thought of. They're incredibly unique and challenging, the way they make part of the level their own and use the map itself to screw with you... like you say, their laughter also gives them way more character than a lot of the enemies have, and between warping the map, laughing at you, and specifically being called out by one of the Magic Crafters dragons, they felt like a much bigger and more serious (and annoying) presence as a kid than any of the other enemies.Via the freeze cheat!To be fair that thread outright suggests creative and not-so-serious comments. Having some humorous responses is part of the post's purpose.Neckman's been on this sub a lot longer than a few weeks.Analyzing things based on screen time is how some people enjoy the show. It's not wrong to do it or to not do it. Like how some people enjoy Pokemon by breeding forever til they get perfect IVs, that doesn't mean they're not having fun playing the game, they're just doing it in a different way.Yeah they haven't even been a thing in here for a month or two at the very least. I don't know where on here people think they're seeing such an influx of new Worlds Apart content.Even in this season she was consistently getting more focus than Keith and Kimmi. I think that part of people jumping to her as "the purple one" was her demographic. (She's younger and cuter and has a better body and for some reason that's like a huge issue with Survivor fans.)Goddess was but I don't think "r.obbed" is really a thing there.Everyone always forgets CST... :(It holds up better when you're not screwing around with things like the freeze cheat, haha. This animation looks much better from a distance.Isn't that just a spoiler being wrong, then? Not anything where the vote was "supposed" to be different or anything that matters game-wise.They also feel so rushed. No closing statements is a bummer, but no opening ones either? The winner reveal is what most of the season is building towards. You think you'd want the Q&amp;A session preceding it to be one of the biggest parts of the show, not something you wedge into as little space as possible for another challenge.Sue's was the original. She outright said "I plead to the jury tonight" to vote a certain way. Erik doesn't totally fit in with the others since he didn't tell or even ask the rest of the jury to vote a certain way. He just emphatically explained his vote and said he hoped the others agreed.I don't think anyone is looking for an "empirically proven winner's edit." There's very clearly no edit received by every winner. I also don't see really anyone going just off confessional counts for winner speculation. And m4milo is the big confessional counter but he's not a "slave"; he's doing it because he wants to create an archive to help people make thier own charts for those who do enjoy the trivia of confessional counts.Yeah well that wouldn't happen if the fucking idiots on this sub weren't so biased that they think Russell (SHOULD/SHOULDN'T - PICK WHICHEVER YOU DISAGREE WITH) have won.Yeah that just makes me love it even more. Sue said she wanted to be the one vote that made Kelly lose the money, and thanks to her speech, she was... but that's probably not the way she wanted her speech to swing it, haha.Needs more Tully. :(Wow, never knew Jesus Christ had such wicked bedroom eyesAndrew Savage is so amazing and I want to bathe in his thousand privileges and I hope he steamrolls the competition yet again tonight to set up his eventual strategic curb-stomping of Stephen FishbachI miss Monica. :(A victory for Savage would be a victory for all of us with courage and valuesProbst said "Terry", not "Deitz." That's when you know it'll be personal.Back in the premiere, the very first words we saw come out of Terry's mouth were about his son preparing him for the returning players... :(Merge?WTF? The one thing I liked about the three tribes was the idea of them merging with 3. Will they ever carry 3 to the merge? It'd be fucking awesome.OMG SPENCER/KASS IS FINALLY A THING NVM I LOVE THIS SWAP NOWSee, Rocky? That's how you actually encourage someone instead of just being a douchefuck.Mom's spaghettiI love how it showed Savage when Probst said "You don't have to do anything but sit there and enjoy it." Like Savage's thousand privileges &lt;333I love how Savage pauses in the middle of his sentences, often before qualifying them. "One of the best moments in my life... Absolutely."Ciera hoooold up you're Finchering this shit hard2-&gt;3-&gt;2 tribes = fucking messOkay I reaaaally hope Bayon loses. After that confessional, I have no idea how it'd go if they lose, but it'd definitely be amazing.KIMMI MADE IT TO THE GROSS FOODKimmi &lt;3Mike would love this round.Damn this doesn't bode well for Savage
I missed it what'd Jeremy do on the way out that made Probst be all "really?"My god I hope Spencer goes home but I am so worried with the edit it'll be Savage or Kass :(Okay that Woo confessional will soften the blow if this doesn't work outciera ffs nonnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooo all my dreamsI'd bet money we get the \#ChaosKass hashtag again tonight no matter how it goesLITTLE DEVIL PLEASE WINKass is fucking amazingspencer going home at this time in THIS WAY would be so unbelievably godlySurviiiiiiiiiivor bluuuuue ballsThere's often a preconception that women are weaker in challenges so sometimes it's advantageous or necessary for them to team up.Blehhh. :( Good episode but it could have been *so much better* if Kass had taken out Spencer. I don't think anything in this season could have pleased me more than Kass and Savage taking him out together. So this is a bit hard to take.Way too early to really even begin to say. We have no idea where the stories we've seen building are headed so it's pretty much impossible to analyze the season as a whole. It can't "already" surpass something because it is still a greatly incomplete product. I can't imagine it ranking below RI/Caramoan but that's not saying virtually anything, who knows how it'll go.&gt;Chaos Kass is back!
&gt;
&gt;Kass saving Spencer despite her wounds.

These really took a bunch of impact out of the episode for me. It was still fun but maaan that TC was disappointing.A quit. He voluntarily exited the game. If it seems like the connotations are wrong, then the problem is with the connotations. Terry chose to leave.I mean, were they going to force Terry onto the boat if he said he wanted to stay? Terry said that he didn't even think about it and knew he had to go. That's his decision.Because it was clear which decision Terry would make.Ooh. That's a good point and that makes it distinct from Jenna. If you're right that Terry legally had to be there, then yeah, I'd say he was pulled.If production would have insisted that Terry leave for any reason, legally or their own decision or whatever, then yeah I would call it a pull and quit because of what you're saying. I was thinking production would have let him stay.Kass's angel/devil confessional maybeI hope you're right but I think Spencer is far and away the best winner contender right now.&gt;Kelly: 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
&gt;
&gt;Kimmi: 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0

:|Natalie wasn't invisible at any point during the pre-merge, or even close to it. She got well-crafted, decent content every week, especially for someone who only attended one TC (enough so that Edgic had her pegged as the most likely winner candidate in episode 6.) She only fell off briefly during the immediate merge.lol @ [the only two comments in this thread right now](http://i.imgur.com/6DtpAfp.png)I was way bummed about the outcome. :(Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. I think they just don't like each other.Hahaha this is my new favorite gif&gt;being dealt the shittiest of hands

But he entered the Cagayan merge in a majority. He had an excellent hand there but failed to keep it; a member of his alliance flipping is on him for not managing her well enough. (Especially when she's said it was because he very visibly had an F3 pact that didn't include her, but it still stands even if that's not the case.)It didn't seem to happen to the alliance she voted with at the merge. It's absolutely a legit flaw that Spencer gave Kass 0 reason to think she had a future in his alliance.She said post-game that she flipped because of a visible Spencer/Tasha/Sarah F3 alliance she wasn't in on, but even if it *were* just against Sarah, that just means Spencer failed to recognize a crack in his alliance and/or was so unable to convince Kass he was worthwhile that she didn't mind bombing his game to take out someone else.I feel like the edit's setting up Stephen with that confessional this week and the Savage/Stephen storyline needing a quick resolution. If it's not Stephen then maybe he'll manage to actually take out Savage or Joe.Per Terry's exit interviews, Danny's heart seems to be working fine, but he still needs to go to the hospital 1-2 times a week to make sure his body isn't rejecting it, and his immune system was absolutely wrecked so they need to take special care that he doesn't get sick right now. So once we know his other organs are cool with their new roommate and his immune system repairs itself, then he'd be good, but that'll be a little bit away. He's not even going to school right now, let alone an island on the other side of the world.boooooooJoe got oily so that's probably enough for them to put it in their top 5How do you get that from him joking around in one of his power rankings?It isn't a distraction if you don't open the threads about their social media posts.

Honest question: Do we know what Max's attitude was before he lost the game? He was semi-active in the fanbase but not really on here or anything. He clearly really liked the show, but that's different from never joking about it.

And if his attitude did change, maybe there actually was something he did see in being on the show that he didn't see before. He would not be the first contestant to say that.&gt;(some "Survivor expert" he is psssssh, those students should get a refund)

It was a class about reality television as a part of pop culture. I do not believe he ever attempted to teach students how to play Survivor well (but correct me if I'm wrong because that certainly would be silly of him.)But Max and Jenn aren't even on the show. How can they ruin the integrity of something they're not a part of?Has Jenn ever taken anything seriously, though? Her attitude towards the power rankings has been completely in line with her attitude towards everything ever from day one of filming when she laughed about choosing the tribe leader based on sandwiches. That doesn't mean you have to find it funny or anything, but with Jenn you always know exactly what you're getting, so if you think power rankings should be more serious, it might make more sense to direct that annoyance at the person who selected her to write them.I think the people upvoting "Max is annoying and has a GROSS FACE" and downvoting Max's comment where he literally just said "This is what the joke was" - he wasn't even defending it or saying it was funny or anything, just providing context for people who didn't read it - are up in arms.

The joke falling flat or not being funny is one thing, but extending that to bold things like "ruins the integrity of the show", going to entirely personal attacks, and rage-downvoting whatever he posts into oblivion is different.For reference, here are the 35 levels in their order in the game (which, again, has no bearing either way on their order in the link; that was determined entirely at random):

* Artisans Homeworld

* Stone Hill

* Dark Hollow

* Town Square

* Toasty

* Sunny Flight

* Peace Keepers Homeworld

* Dry Canyon

* Cliff Town

* Ice Cavern

* Doctor Shemp

* Night Flight

* Magic Crafters Homeworld

* Alpine Ridge

* High Caves

* Wizard Peak

* Blowhard

* Crystal Flight

* Beast Makers Homeworld

* Terrace Village

* Misty Bog

* Tree Tops

* Metalhead

* Wild Flight

* Dream Weavers Homeworld

* Dark Passage

* Lofty Castle

* Haunted Towers

* Jacques

* Icy Flight

* Gnorc Gnexus

* Gnorc Cove

* Twilight Harbor

* Gnasty Gnorc

* Gnasty's Loot

Each of those 35 is used once and only once.That's excellent!Impossible to say. We have no idea what most of those episodes were building towards or what the big-picture storylines of the season are.If only to destroy EdgicWaterway on the edge of Autumn Plains? That's interesting.

Why would they remove rolling ;~;Game of Thrones, because a lot of the deviations they made really disappointed me and I lost interest.

Heroes, because Heroes.I feel like it's him or Spencer, so go Jeremy!Different sort of fear: anxious fear that an SO is being dishonest.

&gt;Well I've tried so hard baby
&gt;
&gt;But I just can't see
&gt;
&gt;What a woman like you
&gt;
&gt;Is doing with me
&gt;
&gt;So tell me who I see
&gt;
&gt;When I look in your eyes:
&gt;
&gt;Is that you, baby,
&gt;
&gt;Or just a brilliant disguise?

Maybe the best song off this album (1987's *Tunnel of Love*, one of his more forgotten albums.) Not as mind-blowingly awesome as a lot of his stuff but a really strong pop rock song with some pretty strong and sad lyrics. "God have mercy on the man who doubts what he's sure of" is a great line.Voting out Garrett was unequivocally in her best interest.

I don't really think either of them flipped for attention. According to both Kass and Sarah, it was as a direct result of the transparency of a trio that included Spencer, not just of something Sarah did after the merge. That doesn't make him an awful player, but it does mean he lost control of his ally and assumed they'd be loyal while giving them no reason to be, which was a flaw in his game.If there was an obvious, implied reason to be loyal, that just tells me that her *still* feeling so little desire to remain loyal reflects even worse on the person who was with her for half the game. If in 19 days Spencer couldn't create a bond with Kass that would even prevent her from doing something so obviously wrong, that reflects poorly on Spencer as a player. Which, again, isn't to say that he's awful... but that he's not *literally infallible* either and that he could have managed her better. I'm also not saying it's *just* him at all, but it's him as much as almost anyone else.

I don't see how it's "obvious" that Kass did it for attention when both Kass and Sarah say it was because of Kass's feelings on the three-person crew of Sarah/Tasha/Spencer. Both Kass and Sarah say it was because of that trio's formation, so I don't think I'm the one "extremely cherrypicking."I don't think Spencer was hopeless. I think he could have promised more to Kass by saying "Hey, we're spending time with Sarah, but it's Luzon to the end" or at least making his new alliance with Tasha/Sarah less obvious. As far as I am aware, he did not make any effort to conceal her outsider position on that tribe.

I think even Spencer himself probably owns this as a flaw, since it lines up pretty much exactly with "I should have cared more about people's emotions instead of expecting everyone to make the most rational move at every time." The failure of NuAparri's core to make Kass feel like an integral part of the tribe is the foremost example of the exact thing Spencer has repeatedly said was his biggest problem in Cagayan.It was playing in my heart when I found out he was goneThe entire [S5E8](#s "Tyrion/Dany") scene was really pointless and underwhelming to me, too. It felt like they wanted to see those two interact so they just made it happen even though there was really no reason for it and nothing to take away, and it showed.

I was also mildly irked by [S5E8](#s "the change from 'Cat of the Canals' to 'Lana' or whatever. It's not a major change or anything but it's the kind of minor one that feels utterly pointless; all it does is take away that bit of emotion from Arya's arc. Going by 'Cat' is really emotional and while removing it doesn't fuck up the story or anything, it also just makes the story that much *less* powerful for no real gain and leaves me scratching my head about why they bothered changing it.")How Can Capital Letters Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't RealWhoops, fixed. Thanks.What on Planetos are you so upset about..? I'm not "pretending" anything so making assumptions like that is weird, and swearing at me, making it personal, and calling other people's opinions "pointless"/"pathetic"/"annoying"/"stuck-up" is really unnecessary and disrespectful.

There are plenty of changes I didn't mind or even liked, including ones that lots of other people hated. That was not one of them... and even in my comment, I heavily emphasized that it was a *minor* thing that *mildly* irked me, because I had a feeling it'd be met with some "Fuck off book purist get over it" comment, though I didn't expect anything as random and strong as yours. I have no idea where you're coming from with... any of that, really. I don't know why someone disliking a deviation in a TV adaption is such a sensitive and upsetting thing to you.

For just two examples off the top of my head of deviations I didn't mind that other people did, I mostly liked the [S4](#s "Craster's keep") storyline in S4 (I think the antagonist could have been a little less over-the-top, but in general I thought it was effective and I thought it was a smart, creative addition while virtually everyone else who read the books seemed to hate it), and I always feel like I'm in the minority because I think it was smart for them to change Asha's name to Yara and don't get why people are upset about it.I wish we'd had senior quotes. Mine would have been "Be nice. Play fair." Possibly would have worked Colby's "Hopefully in the end, you wore a white hat more of the time than you did a black hat." in, too.\- Michael Scottlol forever @ Janet "Scout Cloud Lee" Spencer telling Julie to get in touch with her rootsReally wish people brought up Cochran more often.Because they have not yet cast the MORP g.oddess of the Imagination MoversHaha, so he comes to the exact conclusion I come to, and the one I expected: "Who the fuck knows? Coldhands is weird as shit, fuck if I know."Become close friends with Mark Burnett and Jeff Probst so they will put you on 4 of 19 seasons and openly celebrate the fact that you "finally won"

(Or, for a more serious answer: Play to your strengths so they cover your weaknesses, whatever those happen to be, and be whatever your cast wants you to be. Know yourself, know your opponents, and adapt; there is no one "way" to win Survivor, and that mindset is actually the opposite of a good idea. Tom could never have won how Natalie White won.)So your "Spoilers Ep. 7" tag applies to two shows now. :PAww your dog is really cute. &lt;33This sounds fantastic. I don't drink but I look forward to seeing other people's when you post them. And showing it to my sister who definitely drinks.omg hi!Imagination Movers is the shit, yo. I watched it religiously for like three days once.

Nina is their, like, neighbor or whatever. The girl. The mouse is just named "Warehouse Mouse" (and is *clearly* OTTP.)It's basically another Cochran path, haha. The first season the guy himself is annoying and he gets an annoying, b.s. edit; the second time the guy himself is better, but you can hardly care enough to like him when it's being presented in such a masturbatory way.Only because Lex outlasting anyone besides Brandon is. \^_\^Othello gave the job to another dude, actually.Didn't this happen with Kyle in a South Park episode?Haha, I never got the "Sanders" chicken joke til just now.Thank you!Haha, I wonder now if maybe I made it *too* hard, and here I was worried it was too easy... It should still be going!I'd like to do one for all three of the games, if there is interest!She absolutely deserved to win over Russell. She formed personal relationships that she knew would benefit her at that exact FTC.My fourth favorite. The location is absolutely stunning and provides a viewing experience wildly different from any other in the history of the show, especially with such a diverse and colorful cast.Haha, I was going more for self-parody on this one.The story is what's created by the editing. I agree that the events that played out could have been good, but what we get is what was presented.I've heard Cochran was a recruit but don't know if that's True. Erinn was recruited and had seen every episode from the beginning, her whole family were big on Survivor. I think Cassandra was a big fan.^^^^erinnamaplzSurvivor: NicaraguaYeah to me this wasn't foreshadowing, just great symbolism that furthers the themes of knighthood being b.s. and so forth.Savage &lt;3

Thanks for the submission! Hope to see you around more!Gee whiz, thanks!He does an excellent job of remaining a good sport about his sudden, twist-induced (again!) loss even while being stunned. Passionate about the game but always respectful of his competitors, he really is a role model for anyone who would involve themselves in Survivor or any other competition! I bet it comes from his background in college sports.A finger can be worth a thousand words! Welcome aboard - hope to see ya around more in the future!I respectfully disagree.One of the best challenges ever. Little Jon's game was wrecked the day he decided to crawl over to Morgan a pissant.

Thanks for the reminder and welcome to the sub!&lt;333 What a heartwarming photo!I've been wondering the same ever since that epic ep.2 confessional about Stephen, but last night I got too into a Springsteen song and accidentally pinched myself on the fingertip with a nail clipper, and I did not wake up, so I think I can confirm that it is.Done!oh my god i didn't know until just now that "wimpy little non-leader" was actually a thing he said

God bless him &lt;3&gt;He is most proud of the fact that he met and married his soul mate and fathered two angelic girls [...] His hero is Nelson Mandela because he feels he is the Truest sole survivor. In Savage's words, "President Mandela outwitted, outplayed and outlasted a troubled nation"

How could anyone dislike this guy? He's a gem.

I hadn't seen this even as a proud Savage fan, so thanks for sharing! Welcome to the sub and I hope to see ya around more in the future!The face of undignified disloyalty if I ever saw it.Let it be known that I would do no such thing if there were an equivalent sub even for someone as deceptive as Fishbach, and I think the other members of Savageantu are the same. Actions speak for themselves, and whoever would downvote an innocent subreddit in support of a Survivor contestant says far more about themselves than about that contestant or their fans!Revisiting all this really drove home for me what an excellent, dramatic character and fierce competitor in the game Savage was. Fantastic casting choice.

I think a confessional ranking may be in order...If you look at the rules for /r/Savageantu, you will see that its scope is limited to posts about Andrew Savage, while the circlejerk subreddit has regular posts about unpopular onions, Sharnini, llamas, Grant, etc.

Also, Savage fandom is serious.&lt;3 Best-titled post in the sub so far. Welcome aboard, happy to have you here!"Taking the gloves off" is a reference to "Let's take the gloves off" from the same confessional as "pissant"! I thought about pissant, since it's up there with the all-time best Savage quotes, but I also thought people might not want to use it since it'd be like saying *they* were a pissant? Definitely could add it if it's wanted, though - and if I put it in quotes (so the flair would say "That little pissant", instead of just saying That little pissant), then it's clear you're supporting the Savage quote and not the pissant himself. That could work.Hahaha, I wish I'd had this .gif weeks ago while everything was still ongoing. \#shakeitoff Welcome aboard!To be more unambiguously serious for the span of one post: I'd say it isn't "another /r/survivorcirclejerk" because it is a different subreddit with different aims, a different scope, and different content. But it is for sure, unquestionably, another circlejerk subreddit based around Survivor - just a more *specialized* circlejerk, so I don't think it's redundant. It's another Survivor circlejerk subreddit - but not another /r/survivorcirclejerk. I wouldn't say it's satirical necessarily, since it's not sarcastically praising someone I actually hate, like if I made an over-the-top pro-Hantz sub or something. So by and large, it's kind of a non-serious expression and exaggeration of actual serious opinions (though it may also feature unironic praise of things I enjoy more ironically; like, do I actually think Stephen Fishbach lacks all courage as a human being? No - but I did enjoy the Savage confessional where he said that, so there I'll play it up like I agree.) I guess that that would be the best description of it I can come up with, as far as my posts go: mostly a non-serious portrayal of serious beliefs, with some stuff I don't seriously believe thrown in there too, and the lines between the two are intentionally blurred or even invisible.

But all of this, of course, only applies as far as *my* posts go - and I am not the only poster there! **Ultimately, I would say the best description of the subreddit is "Post positive things about Andrew Savage", and what exactly that means and where it falls on the spectra of "serious/circlejerk" and especially "sincere/sarcastic" may vary from redditor to redditor, or even from post to post,** and probably shouldn't be thought about too in-depth or for too long. \^_\^

Diplomatic conversation about Andrew Savage is totally something I'm capable of and fine with. But I get, and can continue to get, my fill of that on here. /r/Savageantu is a more light-hearted place where arguments that may get stressful are avoided altogether. It is absolutely a one-sided circlejerk and not so much a hub for legitimate and open Survivor discussion. There are lots of places for the later, /r/survivor included, but before today, there weren't any Savage-centric places for the former. Now there is! A wonderful oasis for all those who support un-wimpy leaders.

I hope this helped!

**tl;dr:** It is a highly serious circlejerk.We welcome Fish fans as well! However, /r/Savageantu is not the best forum in which to express Fish fandom - but Fish fans are totally welcome, provided they're willing to check the Fish fandom at the door and pick it up again on the way out.Hooray!That is a perfect quartet of nouns. I tried to think of more to add but you really hit it all. Excellent moment, excellent submission, welcome aboard.

I feel so... inspired. I want to invent something, or beat up a burglar.Andrew Savage. Not soon since we literally just saw him, but god damn the guy is a dynamic casting choice, I think he'd deliver like 10 times out of 10, and this is as someone who thought he was gonna be a really weak and boring casting choice going into this season.

Sabrina. Definitely would have had her over a few others in this cast, not many people seemed to be rooting for her during the voting and I was more focused on other people, but I think she'd be a bolder player on another season and she absolutely has the personality and wit to be a great character.

Cliff. I thought he was really likable but also showed signs of being a strong player. I think with the right group he could be like a more colorful JT.

Definitely want a Dr. Jill return but I know I've seen some other people say that, but she was an impressive player and fun on social media after the show, I can't wait til we get her on here for an AMA.

Oh probably the most obscure one would be Brooke Struck. Tooootal non-entity on the show but she seemed really fun in an interview I listened to and I think she could be a pleasant surprise on a returning player season, she seems like a way fun and charming character we just saw literally none of on the show before.

Tanya could also be a fun and obscure second chances pick.

...I think this list got less and less plausible as it went on.I'd love to see KShinn to do an AMA. She was open to it when I asked her on Facebook and it looks like people here would be more receptive than I feared they might be.Spoiler-tagged for people who haven't seen it since it's eaaaasily the best part of Fiji and for me (I'm not a fan of most of Fiji) retroactively makes the whole season worthwhile. Surreal, amazing turn of events in the last two episodes and one of the all-time best Survivor stories.

[At the final six, there was a core alliance of Earl, Yau-Man, Dreamz, and Cassandra, with Stacy/Boo as the bottom two. Yau won the car reward and told Dreamz - who wasn't well-off financially, grew up homeless, and didn't own a car - that he would give Dreamz the car if Dreamz, should he win Immunity at F4, would give it up to him. Dre agreed. He planned to honor the deal, but obviously it's best for him if he can keep Immunity, so he planned to blindside Yau that round to avoid breaking his word while also not locking himself into giving up a hypothetical endgame Immunity, but Stacy pulled the original "Stick to the plan" at Tribal Council, Yau figured out what was going on, and Stacy was Idol'd out. Yau won F5 Immunity so Boo was voted out as a physical threat on the bottom of the alliance, and then the Survivors found out that there would be 3 people facing the jury - *not* 2, as Yau and Dreamz both had expected when they made the deal. (The only other season before Fiji to feature an F3 was Cook Islands, but it hadn't finished airing before Fiji started filming, so none of the cast knew the F3 could be a thing.) Dre did end up winning the Final Immunity Challenge and knew that if he gave up the necklace, he'd be voted out - right before FTC. At Tribal Council, he decided in tears to keep Immunity, and Yau-Man was voted out unanimously. After the fact, Dreamz claimed he never considered giving up Immunity, but the episodes make it clear that this really isn't the case and he was changing his story.](/spoiler)

[History hasn't always been kind to Dreamz and a lot of people remember him negatively as someone who "stole a car" from Yau - which isn't helped by the fact that Dreamz was a confrontational, controversial character before that (and may not be helped by Dreamz being black), while Yau-Man was just an adorable old underdog who randomly turned out to be awesome at challenges with the power of science and one of the most popular contestants ever, especially on a relatively negative and unpopular season like Fiji. So for some people it's a really ugly moment in an already ugly season, but I absolutely defend Dreamz here; I'd go as far as to say that if anyone was being a cutthroat "villain" here, it was Yau-Man, trying to exploit Dreamz's socioeconomic status to benefit himself in a game - but, in any case, it was a deal Yau-Man proposed knowing full well how it might go and he himself said he didn't care for basically that exact reason. And as a TV moment I think it's one of the best and most complex things to ever come out of the show, and I do think that by now more people in the online fanbase view it as a compelling TV moment and highlight of the season than an ugly low point, but that definitely is not a unanimous consensus.](/spoiler)Caught in a Survivor ghetto, no escape from twists...Thank you very much! I'm happy you're enjoying it and happy your heart remains open to Savage. \^_\^Man, I was so confident about Jeff Varner's pre-game winner edit I felt as if I'd already been spoiled.Well, someone *did* quit just because Cliff was blindsided. Yeah, what we saw of him definitely wasn't quite JT level - but with the right cast I could see him pulling off a similar performance, having deals with everyone but being likable enough to get by and then winning challenges at the end to keep himself safe. I remember having seen some post-show stuff saying that Cliff was playing a way deeper and more alliance-based game than we saw on TV but can't remember where or who it was.Upvoted because I definitely can't imagine anyone else wanting a Mookie return.Yes!!! I always really liked Leann. I think she's a pretty solid character, not off-the-wall entertaining but definitely dynamic enough that her blindside feels well-earned, but despite being taken down in a big blindside in that season, I think she'd actually be someone most viewers would root for in most seasons. And she would probably destroy a returning player season since she'd have 0 target but clearly has skills. I've really liked her for a while but for some reason never thought of her in the context of a returning player season, but now that I have, I so want to see her come back and crush a second season.&gt;&gt;I'm not a fan of most of Fiji

&gt;YWIW

YWIWIt was in circlejerk mode before it was even created!Thank you very much! I was proud of that touch myself.&gt;Way to go editors, show Abi's thought process when her vote doesn't matter, but ignore her when it's her decision to shift the vote from her protector Savage to her archrival Woo!

Right?? This is one of the all-time weirdest editing choices.&gt;Erik being on Caramoan got me into the show.

I never thought I would ever read that ever.Erik is so adorable &lt;3Clay is a great nomination at this stage. Would have him below any of the pool besides Sugar.I have eaten spaghetti noodles less limpAgreed. As much as I like him, he never aspired to be more than a limp noodle. It crippled Morgan. :(Actually, Ms. Cloud Lee's real name is Janet Spencer, so her long-lost relative is Linda.I like and appreciate the idea, and welcome to the sub! But with how little dignity some of his enemies have, I don't want to risk a disgusting blindside of the subreddit, so I think I will keep mod space limited, at least for now..Yup! Makes Gulp and the first two rounds of Ripto absurdly easy since all you do is spam circle. A bunch of other stuff too. I think for years and years I've probably played through that game with the superflame far, far more than without it. Hell, maybe even overall, since I played that game a *lot* with the superflame in middle school.From Googling I don't see anything about it being fake other than YouTube comments. Do you know if that was proven anywhere? Or just speculated on?That, the NSFW tag, and "Tower of Flesh" made me know it was coming, but I only realized as the drums kicked in how the song tied into it. Well fucking worth it.&gt;5) I am not completely sure. Maybe Strong Belwas.

I didn't see how many questions liberationation asked, so I did a big double-take thinking this was your reply to "Who is Tysha?"If backing Varner is crazy I don't wanna be sane.^^^i'dmakethatfractionsmallerThank you! And we at Savageantu fucking love and welcome you, too.In other words, he's tired of maintaining the facade, and now he can do his Nebraskan accounting openly.&gt;It wasn\u2019t the game I intended to play, it was the game that ended up playing me. [...] If you forgive me, maybe I can forgive myself.

Chiiiills. It's only just hitting me how surreal it is that these lines weren't scripted but actually came out of the show naturally.. and not just out of the show, but out of *Twila.* Man, when this show's awesome it's *aweeeeeesome.*Personally I worry she wouldn't be as great to watch on a second chance, just because I think she pretty much hit every angle that she could in Vanuatu already. But she is definitely one of the absolute best one-time characters ever on the show.To put a more positive spin on it, I love his story at the reunion show about his wife's reaction to it. He seemed to exit in high spirits overall.

Which makes Philippines that more of a fucking gut punch holy hellClosest I've come is Matty's proposal, Coby/Janu at the Palau reunion, and Kathy's quitevac.Haha, now I kind of want to see someone try this on a season that actually ends up having a likable F3.

"Gotcha! I was just being a dick so I'd get dragged this far. It was all an act!"

"...okay but the other people sitting next to you weren't a dick ever."

"...shit"But if they mismanage it too badly then everyone dies and the season ends. There has to be a safety net.Excellent, excellent post. Thanks for it and welcome aboard!Great, great write-up. Man, after watching a season like Cambodia it's awesome to look back at something like Africa and see how much care was given even to an early boot antagonist like Lindsey, and I love that this show has a fanbase that still cares about that years later.

This:

&gt;But of course Lindsey does get one thing that Silas doesn't, something that can take a villain from the Hall of Fame to the stratosphere. She gets another episode after the downfall. Like Ami, Lindsey gets another episode to stick around that will dwell on just how hopeless her position is.

is a part of the write-up I especially liked that I will try to appreciate more on my next Vanuatu rewatch. I always thought the Leann blindside was a little less climactic because it's Leann and not Ami... but actually, that might make it even *better* in the moment since you know Ami's had her power ripped away but don't know what she'll do with her back up against the wall, and it means you get a full denouement of having her totally powerless, something that's definitely better with Ami than it'd be with Leann.Love this post. It's a very fair place for him and for Deena, and this reminded me of some great Clay gems I forgot. Reaffirmed my fandom for Clayngel.It might be because your question was slamming Sophie's appearance and objectifying Jefra all within the span of one sentence. That is a pretty high density of things it isn't necessarily worth responding to.Borneo, Marquesas, and Pearl Islands are pretty much tied. If I rewatched them back-to-back-to-back I could probably split hairs enough to outright say Borneo is my favorite, but they're all perfect. Borneo has a fantastic, rich story featuring what pretty much had to be the most diverse, developed, well-edited cast of characters in the history of the show. It has drama and shock and humor and intrigue and is generally amazing as hell.

Marq has probably the best and richest story of any season besides Borneo. Rewatching it with a friend, even I was struck by how any of the earliest episodes, I could be watching for any one of like six or seven different stories or dynamics that would all eventually come to a satisfying resolution, often in conjunction with one another. Almost everybody plays a part and gets their due in a season that features my all-time favorite Survivor moment, just about the craziest endgame in Survivor history, and a bunch of other stuff along the way.

And then Pearl Islands is Pearl Islands.Give him like twelve minutes and he can construct his own perfect replica of Tribal Council with nothing but a handful of Lincoln Logs.If Joe wins every single challenge of the season that would be so awesome and make me forgive this season for everything I haven't liked about it so far. I think Sugar might be the one contestant in all of Survivor where I really can't argue on any level with her ranking anywhere. I'd rank her, like, I don't know where numerically but some region of mild like, because I loved her sometimes but hated her sometimes. And if someone thought the whole experience was awesome and put her in their top 10 ever, awesome, she deserves it. If someone thought the whole experience was awful and puts her in their... well, okay, not below Will or Rocky or whatever but really really low, awesome, she deserves that too. She's such a weird character that I don't have any idea how to process but I'm definitely happy she was on our TV screens.I don't even get how someone could like him since he's just so thoroughly *ugh* any time he says or does anything. I dunno. Alex or whoever I can at least theoretically understand it but Rocky's just... such... a cock... always, on top of being utterly horribly sexist on so many levels.It's definitely multiple. And yeah I dunno, he doesn't make me laugh. He makes me angered, annoyed, massively uncomfortable, and borderline frightened.Ain't nothing wrong with some tomfoolery! I had to shovel the driveway today with the snowstorm, and I'm a little disappointed in myself for not taking advantage of the opportunity to channel Savage. Next time, I'll be sure to *lead* the shoveling - not be a wimp - and I'll be happy to do everything I can to help out my amazing, happy family.I certainly hope so.Season 7 is going to fuck your fucking mind. 10 is also nuts when all is said and done and I've enjoyed it more like every time I've seen it. Season 7, though...Oh my god, you nailed his mid-sentence pauses so perfectly.I would get this if I had an iPhone.Yeah I was just going for hyperbole because it's shorter than saying "then everyone finds themselves in a near-death situation forcing a removal by medical professionals and the season ends."What did you enjoy about Worlds Apart or the earlier seasons? That could help point you to future seasons that may appeal more specifically to you.I can't see more than 5 looking at the first link.Some people did not enjoy the content of that air time.

edit: This might have come off a little snippy since I didn't elaborate which wasn't my intention, just posted it quickly before getting offline. I could elaborate on why I am not a fan of Vytas if you are interested.Marquesas and Amazon contain some of the players you mentioned and are probably the two most important post-Borneo seasons in developing Survivor strategy. Amazon is more advanced but Marquesas is a stepping stone to it that definitely moves past what we saw in Borneo and Australia.I would like to see just one season in which Probst is replaced by a WatchogI think a better point to make is that even in those cases, some of their ancestors surely wanted to get laid.I love when I see "Shutupredneckman2 [comment score below threshold]" and don't know if it's going to be something totally reasonable/impersonal that shouldn't have gotten downvoted. or.. something like this. It's like I'm flipping a coin and every Neckman comment is a new Targaryen baby.It wasn't "pure vanity." She lost her teeth in a traumatic mugging and when she once again found herself alone without her teeth needing help, she flashed back to when she was mugged. If she'd quit there it would have been much more of a Sleckman-esque medevac than anything since that was straight-up post-traumatic stress.

I also don't know when Brenda "sacrificed her own game"; saying "Nah. You can just keep having a mental breakdown" would have been so short-sighted, evil, and idiotic that even Hantz wouldn't have done it, since then someone else would have just grabbed it anyway and then everyone knows Brenda as the person who didn't care about someone's mental breakdown. Brenda looking for Dawn's retainer (iirc after other people had already looked for it) might be the single easiest and least sacrificial decision anyone has ever made in the entire history of Survivor.Judd annoyed the bajeezus out of me. "Millimeters of a second" is one of the best things anyone's ever said, but other than that I thought he was just obnoxious - not in an ironically fun love-to-hate way, just in an "...oh. You're still here." way that for me works a lot better on paper than in practice for him. He was just this big force of negativity and anger that hung around making things unpleasant for way too long.

Really don't enjoy Spencer, Russell Hantz, Cochran, or Rodney, but those are more polarizing. And I really dislike Tony but more because of the way his story played out than him as a character himself most of the time.I don't think Fiji is an "early season." It came seven years into the show after 20-person casts, the final three, and Hidden Immunity Idols.Neither. Most contestants are neither.It seems like an unusual one but it actually worked pretty well I think. It flows surprisingly well as a standalone album, it has a lot of really catchy and energetic songs that are incredibly easy to get fully invested in, and it's pretty diverse. It's honestly still one of my favorites, I think it's a fantastic collection. I grabbed 18 Tracks and WOAD since it had just come out, then Born To Run and Magic, and Greetings/Darkness soon after that. USA was probably somewhere in those earlier stages too, I think it might have been alongside Greetings and before Darkness (since I already knew the title track and Dancing/Dark.) But yeah, my beginning was 18 Tracks and Working on a Dream - but it worked!

I've made some progress in Tracks! I'll be going through it slowly but surely.Good write-up, better than I probably could have given actually despite potentially liking her more. I'm fine with her lasting to this point because she's a fun part of the introduction to Hogwarts, and I may have had her over a *few* still in - but not many. It's fitting for her to rank one spot above Binns I think. She's a very effective minor character. Also really loved her actress. Actually her actress is the one member of the whole cast I can't separate from their character.&gt;Upon rereading Ogden's scene, I realized that he doesn't, as I previously thought, show absolutely no character trait or characterization that separates him from the mundane.

Of course he doesn't! Wouldn't be supporting him if he did.

...These double negatives are weird. But yeah he def has personality.

Good write-up. Ted is supplementary but he's still likable. I like that he's there instead of someone we know doing all of this, makes it more believable that we don't know all these relatives and Order members well. As a dude he's fucking tops, as a character this is a legit spot for him and I'd probably have him below a few that have been cut already.Word up yo. My thoughts on this post appear in the comments of the Mary post more or less. This is a really good spot for Reg and I'm happy he made it a little further, even if there's no real reason for him to rank above Mary. Cattermoles ranking just above Ted Tonks feels right.Yeah, Bertha is basically a plot point and would have been one of my very next cuts. I am very happy to see her out and wish she was a bit lower.Harry Potter's Ser Ilyn. I think he's memorable and kind of chilling, more than Yaxley and Rookwood and whoever, and I was worried he'd get cut alongside them. Quite pleasantly surprised he made it this far but he doesn't need to go further. Very very happy about this particular ranking.Yeah this headline says nothing and is blatant clickbait. I don't think "Law enforcement taking stuff" is bad in and of itself.

Even in the article itself, we see:

&gt;If you add up all the property stolen in 2014, from burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft and other means, you arrive at roughly $12.3 billion, according to the FBI. That's more than double the federal asset forfeiture haul.

&gt;One other point: Those asset forfeiture deposit amounts are not necessarily the best indicator of a rise in the use of forfeiture. "In a given year, one or two high-dollar cases may produce unusually large amounts of money \u2014 with a portion going back to victims \u2014 thereby telling a noisy story of year-to-year activity levels," the Institute for Justice explains. A big chunk of that 2014 deposit, for instance, was the $1.7 billion Bernie Madoff judgment, most of which flowed back to the victims.I don't think it's nitpicking. It's after tons and tons of complex development in both the show and the game, and I think "strategy", lying, and backstabbing were very fully established by season six or seven. I think by "early seasons without backstabbing" people mean the first ~5 seasons at the most. Survivor had moved far away from Australia long before Fiji and more things airing after Fiji doesn't change that.idk why i didn't reply to this for over a week lulz

But that's fair then. I don't really watch for unpredictability/plays so I guess that'd be a difference. As far as likable players, though, I do have kind of a hard time getting into pretty much anyone remaining.Shocking F4I'd definitely have both Gerv and Coolleen in. Borneo pretty much had to have a bunch of likable, entertaining, complex people, and it succeeded.I'm so happy Scout and Clanence made it so far &lt;3 These are very fair places for them to come up and I'm thrilled that they hit them as often forgotten gems of single-digit seasons.I'm totally good with this pool at this stage which shows how far along this is. I want to see Burton higher than the other four, though. But the others I could all lose around here and be fine.Hell there's barely even a song I don't *love.* I mean, okay, I "only" like track 2. But then the other seven are all among the absolute best things I've ever heard in my life, it's unbelievable. It's insane. I basically revere this album like nothing else I've ever heard.It's not as big as the others but it's still a great song. The lyrics are what make it and I think the melody is really pretty and matches them. And with all the other stuff on that album you need *one* to take the energy level down a little bit.Whoa, nice! I'd love to see a picture of that.Bruce is my favorite artist ever by so, so, so many miles but I've still not seen him live. I can't wait to change that.Excellent, excellent choice! Absolutely love Bruce and I agree that some of his best-known stuff isn't even representative of how great he can be. Born to Run is just *mind-blowing.* I don't have a turntable or anything and don't know if I plan on it (I just stumbled on this thread) but I *still* bought a copy of this just to own it and, like, feel and gaze in awe at the sleeve because god it's suuuch a fantastic album.This might be weird to say a week later to such a short comment but thank you for this sentence! Pretty much the only book series I've read are HP and ASOIAF. I last read HP a few years ago and have gotten into ASOIAF since then, and obviously it can be a lot more complex and gut-wrenching and whatnot than HP often is, so I've had a hard time going back to it. But for some reason this sentence and image helped me realize how it can still appeal to me - not by trying to view it the same way I view ASOIAF or getting the same things out of it, but just as something *comfortable* in whose familiarity I can lose myself. &lt;3Yeah if by early you meant earl*ier* than now then that's obviously True. I might have just been misinterpreting what you meant in that part of the comment. To me "early" vs. "earlier" are distinct but I was just misinterpreting, not trying to nitpick.All good and forgiven. Likewise, sorry if I came off as kind of nitpicky.

No worries, we're cool. (As if I could ever *not* be cool with someone with gold Kimmi flair &lt;3)Marvelous, thank you!To be fair, that bad record came about partially due to a medevac then a horribly executed tribe swap and critical injury.

Although I think they care more about entertainment anyway; by design, a bunch of people aren't going to make it far on every single season.I wouldn't have him this out myself but I wouldn't be too upset if he was out. He fell after my most recent Palau rewatch. I still love him but I love others more.Why? I haven't seen it in years and I'd love to like it more, or dislike it less, on my upcoming rewatch, because obviously the more Survivor I enjoy the better. But I don't really know what positive things to look for after episode 4/5 or so.Use something like "1)" or "1 - " instead.Dan &lt;3 Rupert &lt;3 Angie &lt;3Why Leann?He was just a littttle less outwardly colorful and a littttle more game-y than I remembered. I still rank him super high but just, like, low 20s/very very high 30s now as opposed to #11 or #12. So he still ranks super high.How did you compare them, exactly?

Also it sounds like Fleaa has good taste then.Damn I gotta check out more Bloc Party. I only know some of Weekend in the City, and Like Eating Glass from THAW, but that song was great.I'll go with the earliest seasons' format for the sake of simplicity. They take 16 people and put them on two teams ("tribes") that live on different beaches. Each tribe has an equal number of men and women. Each episode, the tribes compete in one challenge for a Reward (supplies to make a fire, food, shelter, etc.) and, more importantly, one for Immunity. Whichever tribe loses the Immunity Challenge goes to Tribal Council, and everybody privately votes for one member of the tribe (besides themselves.) Whoever receives the most votes is eliminated on the spot.

When ten contestants remain, the two tribes merge into one, and they compete for individual Rewards and Immunity. Every player attends Tribal Council and votes for anybody besides the winner of the Immunity Challenge. Again, whoever gets the most votes goes home. This is until the final two, when the Final Tribal Council is held. At the Final Tribal Council, the last seven contestants voted out (so everyone starting with the F9 - or everyone who made the merge except for the first person voted out after the merge) vote for a winner, after the F2 plead their case and the jurors get a chance to ask any questions they feel are necessary.

Whoever receives the most votes wins the title of Sole Survivor and $1,000,000.

Right now we're on season 31, and over the years, the focus of the show itself has shifted, with less focus on developing a dramatic narrative involving the Survivors and more focus on "the game" - contestants forming alliances with one another to not vote each other off, then remaining loyal to or breaking those alliances as they expect will benefit them, etc etc. A *lot* of twists have been introduced, too (seasons often have more than 16 people now, etc.), but the basic structure remains the same: a couple tribes compete against each other with the loser voting someone out, then it goes individual, everyone's at risk, and then a winner is chosen by the last few contestants voted out.

Very entertaining show for a number of reasons, although many different viewers have many very different reasons for watching it, so what exactly makes the show good depends on what season you're talking about and who you ask, but everyone here will agree that it is good and worth watching. (Although the current season might not be the best place to start, if you're interested, because its cast is made up entirely of contestants from previous seasons, and their previous seasons are mentioned basically every week.)

**tl;dr: People put into two teams, team that loses challenge votes someone out, eventually it's individual, winner is voted for by the last few people eliminated**&gt;"Alliances" are voting blocs

Shh, don't let Stephen hear you.Didn't he also tell whichever teachers/officers would listen that it was just a clock?I think S27 is like the least interesting one either way, so I would be interested in reading this and seeing how it could really evoke any strong emotions. It didn't do any good or bad for me, really.1m USD today still comes out to [over $700k (pre-taxes)](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=1%2C000%2C000.00&amp;year1=2015&amp;year2=2000) in 2000 dollars, though. So it has but it's still a bunch of money.Rob/Phillip/Natalie because Rob was clearly winning and told us like an episode into the merge that he wanted to be there with Phillip and Natalie, who both got really clear "I am losing a jury vote" edits.Ooh word. Do you have a list of what all I have in common with fleaa? Or any way of seeing easily who these rankers are the *least* like?

Thanks for all the organization and data and shit. It makes up for liking Rocky.Oh damn that sounds fun. Okay. Now I wish I hadn't watched, haha. But that'll be great.I think WOAD is way underrated. I mean it's not one of my absolute favorites by him, but I think it's pretty enjoyable throughout, and I am a big fan of both Supermarket and Pete. Definitely not his worst.Ggg"Baseball your sport?"

"Uh, no... makin' love is my sport. ...:D"

"Play often?"

"Not often enough."This is fucking beautifulYou're welcome!Laura needs to be on a second chance season. Put her on a tribe that wins more challenges and she would tear shit uppp.I've known **Born in the USA** (song, not album) for as long as I can remember, my dad would play it sometimes and I couldn't get enough of the synth at the beginning. When I was maybe 11 or 12, I heard **Dancing in the Dark** on the radio at a store and thought "Oh my god this song is so cool! That's even better than the other one!" I made a mental note to look up more by him, and it took me a little bit to get around to it since I perpetually have a few artists I want to grab more music by and didn't know what all I was missing with him. (At some point or another I think I also heard Glory Days and liked it more than I do now. Its storytelling was probably more straightforward for a 12-13 year old than some of the others, I guess.)

But after a year or two of thinking "Hey, that song was really, really good", I grabbed two albums from the library: **18 Tracks**, since I liked how straightforward the title was, and **Working on a Dream**, since it had just recently come out. Those were my first two full Bruce albums, and they definitely lived up to my hopes. Around the same time also grabbed Greatest Hits since that seemed like a good introduction, but for whatever weird reason I only listened to a random selection of tracks off it: Born to Run, Thunder Road, Streets of Philadelphia, and Human Touch. Fell in love with **Human Touch** instantly, but then as I really started focusing on **Born To Run/Thunder Road, that led me to that album...** and obviously from there it was history.

So yeah: Born in the USA was the first one I heard and liked, Dancing made me crave more, 18 Tracks/WOAD/Human Touch (song, not abum) satisfied that... but then BTR/Thunder Road made me realize I wasn't satisfied, and that album - obviously still my favorite album - escalated him from a neat curiosity to my all-time favorite artist.Replace The Rising with Dancing in the Dark and Human Touch and you pretty much have my exact introduction. Born in the USA was my first, a few others got me intrigued, but then BTR/Thunder Road just blew everything out of the water.I don't really have any strong vibes about anyone staying or going, but I would be pretty happy to see Stephen go.All the GoF stuff still characterizes Mad-Eye if it's accurate enough that all his lifelong friends were fooled.Good on both of them. Even if Moody isn't physically in a lot of the GoF scenes the stuff that's being done characterizes him just as much. It characterizes both of them at once.This thread will be hilarious if Stephen does quit.WHOA.

WHOA WHOA WHOA.

Fucking HYPE!!! I never thought they'd bring this one back! Fuck yeah!!!!!Coach is too deluded to ever be dilutedDenise Stapley.That is correct. Hell, I'd thought through parts of my Hantz write-up for days before the rankdown actually started.

I think this ranking could be better as far as the list goes but it's hard for me or any ranker in this one to say which one is more interesting to watch/participate in since nobody did that for both of them. I think I like the simplicity of the first one though.Okay now I'm pretty fucking hypedMarry Ciera just to see Luara Morett's reaction to her daughter marrying a homosexualIt depends on how they got there and how the jurors were eliminated.Hahaha oh my god, how do I not remember this?Gervase is aweeeesome. So charming and entertaining, I'd have him even higher honestly, I just love like 80% of what comes out of his mouth. Keith is a legit nom at this stage.Cirie. I still don't really know how she didn't make endgame in the first one even with an Idol. I thought she was a pretty standard top-tier character.I've watched it less than once.Hahaha, I knew she said something fun about Randy but didn't remember the exact comparison, and I totally forgot about the lost cruise ship passenger line. I don't know how we didn't get more of this on the show. Thanks for posting it. I hope we see Courtney again.Cirie is so fantastic in every way. &lt;3After rewatching Cagayan, I definitely wouldn't have Kass in the top 18. She's pretty fun but not as complex or consistent as most of the others here. Definitely a good casting choice but not the, like, shining beacon of post-Sandra Survivor that I saw her has at the time.I want to see a sitcom called "Oh, That Neckman!!" now.30-35 sounds perfect for Courtney Marit to me.I should bump Africa up in my rewatch schedule, because I'm starting to think maybe my "Lex is the male Ruth-Marie" opinion might be a little off the mark.Good cut and write-up, I especially like the contrast b/w her and Cambodia. I think I'd have Earl ranked around here, too. It's True that he doesn't have much of a storyline, but he's just wicked charismatic with a narration style, personality, sense of humor, and level of insight thaHOLY SHIT WE NEED AN EARL COLE AMAt really resonate with a lot of viewers. So I think this or slightly higher is a good spot for him, but not top 20 or anything and I wouldn't be upset to lose him now.

edit - I just found Earl's Twitter and it has the most Earl Cole sidebar description:

&gt;i build things, i survive things, i play things, i produce things, i share things, i consume things, i dream things, i do things.

(Also looked at Courtney's earlier today and it says she was "more participant than player" &lt;3)\u00af\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af I tried really hard to have an opinion of him the last time I watched all of Africa, but that was a few years ago, so maybe things will change this time.It's meant to deter ties. There were 4 deadlocked ties in Australia and Africa. When you constantly have people refusing to flip, things will likely be more static and it's harder to pitch the idea of all the Survivors needing to cannibalize each other when they can just stick together and let fate/a challenge/previous votes decide. If it were a rock draw between the people who got votes, we wouldn't have seen flips like Cochran's. (The only time we *have* gotten a rock draw since then, it was someone flipping *to* cause one while also having the safety net of RI if they draw the wrong one.)And meanwhile to me all of this is like Adam Gentry being the most complex human character of Cook Islands.

...I should lock my doors before Wilbur sees that sentence.Haha that is True.Agreed. I couldn't have cut him *much* earlier in RD1 when there was still my incredibly popular Terry/Judd/Brice/Lex/JT/Todd/Amanda string to take care of, but he should have been lower in both. Dog bar is fucking fantastic and deserves all the credit it gets and more, but it was one confessional out of the entire season. Most of the time he was just blah and MOR. That one confessional does make him waaay higher relative to the god-awful pointless Caramoan cast, but I think for a lot of people - myself maybe included, for him and for others - "He was GREAT as far as this cast goes!" can sometimes translate into thinking he was better in a vacuum than he really was.Zoe, Butch, and Jenn are really the only comparable characters for the first 10 seasons, but all of them still got more development than KShinn.&gt;The only other player from the first 24 seasons remaining is Stephen.

&gt;Abi passed Skupin

As always, thanks for compiling these!&gt;So I suddenly had this thought to make the most average season of Survivor ever.

[.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Survivor27logo.png)Yup, I don't have a lot of things sealed but it feels neat to have some. To know that it's one of the few copies that hasn't ever been opened and that it's made its way to me directly, that's intrinsically valuable to me for certain items....!!!

I am so jealous. Awesome, aweeeesome find.No worries, I love seeing these! And not many seasons can have this much little trivia extra week. Definitely appreciated, thanks for the posts!Oh hells yeah! \^_\^ I am a sucker for anything Pokemon; [here's](http://imgur.com/a/TORKt) the most recent album I've posted here of my collection. For the most part my collecting is limited to Pokemon, but I also have two copies of LSD Dream Emulator and a bit of a Spyro collection I've been meaning to post a picture of.It'd be fun to see a record broken and make the season more fun and memorable so I hope it happens. And we haven't had a good Immunity streak in a while other than Mike, but the edit made Mike way obvious, whereas with Joe I really don't know either way when he's going to inevitably go home.Deer antlers. He'd hit them together because the sound of deer fighting made him feel more competitive and he wanted to energize the tribe with it before challenges.Which song?Who are these posts even directed at? I haven't seen any "Look at me I'm so smart" things this week, or anyone saying they predicted something that it seems unreasonable for them to have predicted, but maybe I have just missed it.I'd like to see this so I can be jealous of another person tooHow is making a prediction the same thing as proclaiming yourself an expert?I don't think that's really relevant. Saying things like "self-proclaimed experts" is turning it into a personal thing about the person who is making the prediction, which comments like that aren't doing, and I feel like, by using the word "expert" four times in two posts, that's referring to some kind of "I'm such an *expert!*" smugness about getting it right that I didn't see. Predicting something on a television show and saying you're an expert on the show because of it aren't the same thing.

edit: And in general I think it is kind of weak to make a post like this that exists solely to mock other users but then try to make it look okay by not actually calling them out directly.I have a weirdly bad feeling that Kimmi will go home tonight. She has also started getting more visible in the past few weeks like Monica did before her departure... I don't know, a string of 0 confessionals, then 1, and then 1 with more insight, that doesn't look great and is identical to what Monica got earlier in the season. (Monica did get a confessional in the premiere, but it was also the bare minimum of what was received by anyone in the cast - they wanted to introduce everyone but she got the smallest introduction possible - so it was functionally 0, as much as anything really would be there.) On the other hand, game-wise I can't think of a possible reason for her to be eliminated, so maybe I just don't want to get my hopes up with how much I have disliked some of the other eliminations in recent weeks. I don't know.

It's a little hard to think about who might go home since some of the editing this season is so erratic, with people jumping from invisible to major or gone with really no gradient in between. Like, Kelly had no story of going home before last week, I don't think. So I sort of *feel* like Abi-Maria can't go home because I *feel* like they'd start building her up negatively again, but I really have no idea, especially with a double boot.

Hmm. Joe could be in there since he obviously doesn't have a great shot of surviving once he loses a challenge, but I also think he might keep beasting them; with how much this season is hyping up new and unprecedented evolutions in the game, tying such a big record would probably be one of those. (But also I'm just biased in favor of him winning challenges.) I feel like Joe/Stephen reaaaally has to be resolved soon, so I'm thinking we lose one of them tonight. A sudden Stephen boot isn't out of the question, because I really have no idea *what* his story is building to, so I guess a blindside tonight is as likely as anything? And Joe/Stephen going on the same night would be funny. If we lose a witch I expect it to be Ciera (I think Abi will get more content before she goes and Kelley feels like a more long-term character of the other two.)

I don't know, this is all really stream-of-consciousness, but I am going to guess that we lose two of Ciera, Kimmi, and Joe tonight. Ciera seems like she has the least story of those on the bottom (though I *could* see Abi taking her place - but I don't expect to lose two of them tonight, and I think Ciera's more likely), Kimmi's just building up in a way that worries me, and Joe/Stephen really needs to be resolved by the end of tonight with how long it's been going on, and I don't think Stephen would go home first when he has the vote twist and probably wouldn't even need it to take out Joe.

Definitely not quite so confident going into this episode as I was going into Monica and Savage's boot episodes, though.I definitely won't cut HvV Rupert.I just want to see Keith and Kimmi and I'll be happylol after that gif i can't unsee spencer's "diving"Previously On segment retconning Ciera into the leader of the Witches? InterestingJoe please win like 40 challengesBest part of Kelly's departure: We might start hearing "Kelley" instead of last names.I feel like Tasha is going to slit *someone's* throat and drink *someone's* blood eventually but I have no idea who or when and I'm so excited for itWhoa okay Angry Brooding Nighttime Joe is fucking sexy

It's like if Erik Huffman put on the locket of Slytherin for too longOh my god... if Keith wins we're going to see him confessionalizing from under a blanket in his winner montage.

Please, Survivor gods, let it happen!People! Humans! Emotionally! Those are things I like!\#blindside"Purple scores!"

Wait, Kelly's in this challenge?I want to see this challenge played by six Crystals

Or five Crystals and a Mike BorassiI just got back upstairs from getting food mid-Spencer confessional, did I miss anything? Thx in advanceHey, Ciera has emotions! I like this Ciera so, so, *sooo* much better.Thank you!Stephen getting blindsided with the vote-stealer in his pocket would be so fireFuck yeah that Kimmi confessional. &lt;33lol @ Joe being such a boss that it makes *Jeremy* low in the pack by comparisonOne side, two side, red side, blue sideJoe vs. Stephen is happening! Fuck yeah!Ooooooh that Stephen confessional... That looks pretty dang bad for him.Whoa whoa whoa. Fishevac???"It's Survivor, not let's make a deal! What happened to the old seasons?"

&gt;Season 2, Episode 10: Let's Make A DealCommercials for prescription drugs annoy me so much

I think my doctor would KNOW if Farxiga is right for me ffsI was hoping the cut after him needing a ray of light would be to Joe walking in with a glow around himOkay this episode is actually really freaking good thoughI am rooting so hard for Joe that I forgot about this twist also being a thing.I'm just kind of holding out on my certainty that they'll be banned eventually."Also, for the first time in a few *weeks,* Joe technically isn't immune right now!""...And you can hashtag that." hahaha. I'm kind of rooting against Stephen in the game but I definitely don't dislike him.My high school sociology teacher who uses Survivor in class is probably LOVING this shit right now"Huyopa" is probably close to the sounds Stephen was making throughout the nightThis is so awesome. Can something like this happen every season always? I have no idea what's about to happen I just know it's gonna be awesomeoh my god i have goosebumps. I did *not* expect that extreme an outcome - even with Keith's confessional earlier, they set this up so damn well! Go Joe and Keith!This is gonna be fucking great. I'm still pulling for Joe but if he has to lose, this is as epic a way as any. And the fact that it involves Keith makes the whole thing even more... I don't really know the adjective. Keith-y.Shameless plug for S[O]LITARY: If you think this challenge is tense, Solitary is basically this every single freaking episode. &lt;3HOLY SHIT

I SO THOUGHT KEITH WAS GOING TO WIN.

I gasped. Loudly and shrilly. It was unattractive. Also I clapped.

Fucking hell! Joe! What even... Joe!Seeing Darrell from The Office sing on a piano like this is really jarringStarting to think Joe may actually be a deity. \#JoesusI think I might start calling him that. Joesus of Nazareth &lt;3Imagine if a strong wind blew that flame towards their shelter and it caught fire and burned down right in front of themHey, an Abi confessional that isn't about receiving votes! Neat!So it's Ciera or Stephen? That's, like... my absolute favorite thing I could hear right now.So now the main thing I'm in suspense about this episode is whether Abi's going to write "poopy pants" on her ballot.I don't think there really is a "hero" or "villain." I think we're basically seeing everyone *fairly* neutrally.If Ciera goes home, after that confessional, the advantage is totally gonna fuck over one of these people.Jer gonna warn Stephen to use the advantage?"Yeah I have two idols, I'm as good at winning challenges as anyone but Joe, everyone likes me, and everyone trusts me - but I'd *also* really love to have my trustworthy ally with an unknown advantage!"

lol jeremy is such an indestructible tank right now.I will go on record predicting that Kimmi randomly goes home. The girls mentioned putting two votes on her or something. And we got, like, Idols and advantages and stuff, who knows. That'd be cray.Joe is such a damn fun presence because everyone knows he's fucked if he loses, and everyone knows everyone knows it. He has literally nothing to lose and his entire presence is this big middle finger to everyone. I'm so happy he's a part of this season. It's such a fun dynamic, and you could say that week by week it gets repetitive but imo it just gets more *unbelievable*, and I hope it continues for as long as possible.alol if drawing a rock is once again the pivotal moment in ciera's survivor storyLong wait. I think he's gonna pla-oh he just did OH SHITFirst mid-TC commercial since Tyson was Idol'd out of HvV, right? And maybe the second one in the show's history? (Panama had a mid-TC break of an entire week during the F4 tiebreaker)"Yeah, Jeff. Like hell anyone here is going to play an Idol."The commercial break is interesting because the most straightforward thing from here would just be "He plays it on Stephen, Ciera goes", which is still really fun but the commercial just breaks up the momentum. I still say it's Kimmi.It seems kiiiind of clear in hindsight because of course you don't want to risk being the *one* person who didn't give it up, but on the other hand, like, Joe is there. Yeah that was a way hard thing to predict either way and I loved it.Jeremy just trying to increase his paycheck by rattling off all these commercials right before his big Idol play. You'd think Jeff would have shut him up by now.Holy shit, this is telling *everyone* who his #1 is. Jeremy's position was so damn secure. I don't know if this is smart or not but I'm daaaamn sure it's *bold,* WAY bolder than I thought Jeremy would go since his position seemed so locked.lol did abi just draw excrement on her ballotOookay now that was pretty fucking satisfying.oh my god *spencer* had the crappy vote??See okay, in an ordinary episode, all the strategy-heavy "BIG MOVE" stuff tends to irk me, but in one like this I can't fault it. Now we actually are hitting the pretty fucking insane level of strategy to where it pretty much *has* to all be jammed in there. And yet we still got those few straight minutes of Stephen breaking down. Yeah this season's suddenly starting to swing back around for me.That was just such a bold freaking play. I have no idea where this season is headed and it is starting to live up to its own hype.Heh. So drawing a rock once again is the pivotal moment in Ciera's game.Ciera and Stephen made more sense on every rational level, Ciera over Stephen once the commercial hit, but high-risk-high-reward picks can be fun!Ooh thank you for reminding me how great a song ["Up Up Up" by GIVERS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hctJWj4ca14) is.OMG AND I FORGOT THIS CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE A THING.

This night is a good night. &lt;3MarquesasOh my god I've never gotten to see one of these live

I feel so peaceful hearing Probst tell this storyWe've never done this challenge with even *near* this many people before. Fun.I wish Savage were here to interject with how many football fields he's played on in his lifeOoh, they've never done this with more than two answers before.I don't know how I feel about it being utterly random like that. But at least even Kelley and the episode are openly saying it's luck.It is another Old-School throwback; those are the same bugs from Colleen Haskell's famous intro shot, come again for their \#SecondChanceWhat did Stephen do? My dog started barking and it distracted meHey good for him. I'm happy he won a thing.This is the first time Stephen has ever been described as being like a "Rock Star"I feel like we haven't seen a "Pick 1-2 people" thing in a while since they tend to draw for teams. That's also something that should be more common.Oh my gosh if Spencer finally does a thing of consequence and justifies all his hype that'd be fun.Ooh fun. I wish I'd caught that. Thanks!Jeremy's reaction when Stephen chose Tasha had me hoping Stephen wouldn't pick him, his tantrum-throwing side from SJDS ep.3 would come out, and he'd suddenly launch an emotional crusade against the person he just saved. I mean it never would have happened but that'd be fucking hilarious.Yup, we've seen entire seasons do 180s because of this. It's a huge part of why Sandra won. Hell, even Kim Spradlin almost put herself in jeopardy here (before she recovered from it because, well... Kim Spradlin.)This sub needs Farxiga flair. /u/vacalicious?I've seen people say this season that they think Kelley is hamming things up for TV to get more air time than before or whatever? But I don't see that at all. She seems really genuine to me. And we just saw her being just as expressive to someone outside of confessional about the challenge win. I'm not crazy about her but she's a kinda cute and quirky narrator and it seems real to me.I will now be listening very closely to see if any of these three say "mayhaps"Oh that music hit makes this seem like a very bad idea.

Oh my gosh WAIT! Evil Tasha still hasn't come out! Is she going to nuke Stephen's game after he brings her on the reward? And dethrone this lovely Know-It-All Fish out of water right when he seems to be gaining footing after being at the lowest of the low? Oh my GOD that'd be fun.I don't know what you mean by deep cut but if not, that's fine. The Circlejerk sub can probably work Farxiga in one way or the other..."MmmmmmmNO."

alol. That'll be fun to see on the Funny 115 v3.I hope Abi-Maria flips because she has decided "not throwing challenges to me" is a new definition o
