I see on your report the 34 is 2db louder than the HW30, which means just a little louder. I see others get up to 94 db, which is twice as loud. Both have great triggers, far better than the Walmart fare, although you may like one over the other. Keep trolling the Pyramid Air site, lots of good info. [Airguns of Arizona](http://www.airgunsofarizona.com/) also has a lot of good articles and reviews.So can I have the people at the Violence Policy Center arrested for producing bogus studies about guns? How about the non-profit industry? Where a for-profit puts its money in the hands of the owners, the non-profits are blowing it by padding their administrations to ridiculous extremes. How about we create an efficiency standard, and don't allow government money to be used for a college that doesn't meet it.FYI, that sales and marketing budget includes all the free drugs people can get either as samples at the doctor, the coupons you use to get cheaper drugs. These usually come through rep visits to doctors, which comprise the majority of the marketing budget. Marketing is actually line-itemed as "sales, general and administrative expenses", so it includes a lot more than marketing, such as general administrative salaries and lawyers. What we think of as marketing, ads directed at consumers, is actually a small portion of their whole marketing budget, much less than R&amp;D.

Interestingly, the bill also does nothing about marketing. I do like one part of it though, curbing how pharma companies try to keep their drugs expensive after the patents have expired. Sorry, patent's over, you got your money, develop another drug if you want to keep up profits. I believe that a pharma company should be rewarded quite generously for making a life-saving or disease-curing drug, but our patent system has a hard end date on that reward that should be honored.They are colluding with organizations to deny the rights of millions of Americans, and put lives at risk due to removing inability to defend themselves. So, yes, under your logic, arrest them. The HRC and its predecessor are jokes, and that's why we have historically refused to be on it. Obama put us on it, lending an air of credibility to it, and that was a bad move. That would matter if we chose the president by popular vote.Can we expect a repeat of his push for government access to all of our privately encrypted information? &gt;Donny, why did your family change their name from Drumpf to Trump on emigrating to the US?

Back then, immigrants usually wanted to assimilate into American culture, and thus changed their names to something more American to better fit in.

If Syrians want to come here and assimilate, that's great. The problem is most will probably try to turn America more like Syria -- the country they just escaped. We see it even within the US, people fleeing California, only to try to turn states like Colorado and Oregon into California. Your logic is a stretch, and you are proposing that people be arrested.Dearborn. Isn't that where the Muslims physically attacked the Christian protesters, and their Muslim police chief had the Christians arrested? When you're talking "criminal" the goal is an eventual arrest.The pharma companies have ways of getting around patent expiration. Probably the most acceptable thing they do is find a generic maker and get them up to speed for production before the patent expires, so they can have a chunk of the sales on the first wave of generics. After that, it's a lot of dirty tricks, which includes some bad crony capitalism leveraging the power of the FDA. This can delay unencumbered generics for many years, or even decades since in one case they had the FDA pull the generic after they came up with a newly-patented version of the same drug. 

"Mr. FDA, our drug is safe, please let us sell it. Oh, patent's about to expire, let's slightly modify it and patent the modification, and get it approved. Mr. FDA, that old drug is dangerous, you must outlaw it."&gt;Is that really how we want doctors to get information about new drugs?

They are doctors, they have the information to understand any sales pitch regarding drugs. Where else are they supposed to learn about new drugs, and new applications for old drugs? I'd say it's nicer to have someone visit and tell you everything (and leave around plenty of goodies and free samples), than have to leave to visit seminars and such. I've done entire runs of expensive antibiotics off of free samples before, pretty much everyone I know has gotten free sample drugs. I love free samples. Without the marketing budget, those don't exist.

&gt;hese reps are just the other side of the "ask your doctor about bonerzyte" coin.

I don't like those ads. I'm not a doctor, I don't understand shit about what the ad's saying, but I'm going to your doctor begging for a handful of bonerzyte because a commercial told me it would fix me? No. The doctor can listen to the pharma reps, do other research if necessary, and prescribe bonerzyte to you if he thinks that addresses the problem you came in with. Note all of those are variations of European culture, which we share. A lot assimilate. They can appreciate the guy who rides home from the bar drunk on his horse. They can appreciate kids being taught safe handling of guns in middle school, having rifles in their trucks from early-morning hunting, where a deer pelt is a nice gift for a teacher. The others want that outlawed when they see it.You'd have to provide specifics. Lying is a crime while under oath, when it's called perjury. And you have to prove actual knowing and material lie, not just disagreeing with the science. People are free to spread their beliefs, no matter how False they are. This is why we haven't locked up the Violence Policy Center people yet.

Still, you have a problem here, you want to criminalize general speech. This is not a good thing. Another interesting connection. Soon after she got on the board of TSMC, a major fabricator of chips for Apple. I wonder if that was another thing engineered by Jobs, letting her help him.&gt;Im not talking about Joe Blow simply saying he doesnt believe x.

Yes, you are. Free speech is free speech. You don't get to imprison your critics. That's a Soviet kind of thing. 

&gt;Lying when testifying to Congress is also a crime.

That's what I said, perjury. Of course, what you have is not lying or disagreement regarding science claims like the article is talking about, but perjury on who was where when answering specific questions before Congress. This perjury is unfortunately very rarely prosecuted. If we prosecuted all perjury cases, Eric Holder would be in jail by now on two convictions.As long as blacks overwhelmingly vote Democrat, they will be targeted because they vote Democrat, not because of their race. This wouldn't be happening if they voted Republican. Then the Democrats would be doing whatever possible to minimize their influence while the Republicans tried to increase it.

TL;DR: The parties care about power, not race.I'd bet the Palestinians were living in the shanty of their own accord, and Israelis decided to build a nice community up the street. Yep, if they hadn't tried to obliterate Israel the moment they declared independence, and then lost that war and two others, they would probably be in a much better situation than they are now. 

The main sorrow I feel for Palestinians is due to the surrounding Muslim nations. The locals are just pawns in the larger game to kick out Israel and maintain what they think should be complete Muslim dominance of the Middle East. When left to their own, isolated groups of Palestinians have shown they can live peacefully with Israelis. But in most cases someone has to start some shit, attack the Israelis, and are then surprised when the Israelis respond with overwhelming force.In general I'm okay with the concept of voter ID. But the slightest move to restrict IDs cannot be tolerated. &gt;In addition I think all US citizens should get a passport reminder to them on their 18th birthday with a fee waiver. 

I really like this idea.You register in a specific precinct, allowing you to vote in specific elections. General opt-out doesn't validate residence like opt-in does. That's the main problem. 

Germany, for example, doesn't have this problem. Whenever you move, you are required by law to immediately register your new address with the city. The government always knows where you live. This would technically fix the issue, but how many Americans want to take on this registration requirement? Most Americans cringe when I tell them about the mandatory registration. No, that was also about power. Race is just another factor in determining in general who will vote for whom, which can be used to engineer things to win races. The Democrats aren't against white Mormon males because Democrats are racist, sexist, anti-religious bigots. They are against them because that demographic overwhelmingly votes Republican. I worked a campground in school, all menial dirty work. They've probably hired illegals at half the wage by now. You took advantage of farmers, taking their money for labor (assuming you didn't goof off as much as possible) despite the fact you had no skills or experience. Dump a ton of poop on her doorstep with a dime buried somewhere inside.I think of this quote whenever I hear the terms "assault weapon ban" and "high-capacity magazine ban." That was just picking the most Republican voting block as a general example. As long as Democrats gerrymander according to race, which they do, they do the same thing as Republicans. And they don't do it for race, they do it for power. No sarcasm. I didn't have shit for skills when I took those early drudge jobs. Looking back, it's amazing that I got hired, and I'm happy I did.I remember stories of small schools and libraries getting enterprise-class routers costing tens of thousands of dollars because they had grant money to blow. These things are meant to handle thousands of active connections, and they sit there practically idle, and their IT budget needs to increase because that Cisco contractor is damn expensive whenever it needs to be configured.&gt;As I said, not an opportunity.

You needed money, you got paid. I don't see any taking advantage of here. 

&gt;I am amazed you got hired as well.

Campground menial labor, not a farm. I had one skill that made a ton of money on the side though, cleaning fish for the campers. I guess the campers were taking advantage of me?&gt;Gerrymandering is one thing. Creating laws that require an ID to vote and then shutting down the DMVs in black neighborhoods is another

Not really, it's all just part of the game to get votes for your side and depress votes for the other side. Both achieve the same result through different means. In the end it's still about power whatever the degree of the act is. If blacks voted mainly Republican, you would never see a Republican proposal that minimized the influence of black votes. Same for Democrats on their demographics.True, but it's the same concept, different names, pretty much irrelevant to the discussion. These were specific lies about what they did told during an investiagtion, not what they believe about climate change. You cannot expand specific punishments like this to the oppression of criticism and advancement of political agendas through speech. 

Or please do, I'd love to see the heads of the VPC do the perp walk. &gt; If they weren't racist they'd try to get some of the minority vote

They're working on it. They're even the only party running a black candidate right now (and they did last time too). But until they make significant inroads, votes against them need to be limited. 

That's just how the politics works. It's about power. They don't care what color you are, what gender you are. They care that they remain in power. If a Republican thought it were necessary to garner the gay vote in order to remain in power, he'd flip positions in a heartbeat. This is why if you throw a Democrat in a pro-gun district, all that standard Democrat anti-gun rhetoric gets toned down real quick. A politician lusting for power can certainly be racist, but political tactics designed to win races aren't necessarily racist just because race was a factor. If blacks didn't vote mainly Democrat we wouldn't even be talking about this.They do. It trips some kind of privacy thing. Most people have their address on their drivers license too with no problem, and most states require that address to be up to date. But the idea of having to go to city hall to register your address whenever you move just creeps out many for some reason. 

Of course, if we required this, you'd hear cries of "How are poor people supposed to make it to City Hall during business hours? Why do you hate the blacks? Why do you want to suppress the vote?"&gt;Why does the Democratic party get an overwhelming percentage of the black vote? 

Because in large part the historical party of the KKK keeps the slaves fed.

&gt;how do you think we got laws that targeted specific groups in the first place?

The Democrats wanted to stay in power, while the Republicans worked for equal rights for the blacks because they though that would put them in power.Stock buybacks are common in publicly traded companies. There's no problem here, no rebuttal of the facts I laid out. If blacks voted Republican, this would stop.Sorry for not wanting the US to skew in the direction of oppressive, sexist, bigoted countries that have no religious freedom. &gt; The Census happens every ten years

You don't remember all the privacy concerns about the last census?

&gt;and anyways, it would be trivially easy for a government employee to find out where you live through completely legal means.

I didn't say it was rational. It just is.I have a very hard time believing the Republicans gerrymander a district just because they hate one race.

&gt;Alternately, look up the Southern Strategy

The Southern Strategy is not a wand you can waive to erase the racism of the Democrats or attribute it to the Republicans. In fact, the Southern Strategy was all about winning an election, nothing more. &gt; Its the racism thats a problem.

Again, if blacks voted for Republicans, you wouldn't have things like this because Republicans wouldn't cut off their own power base. Thus it's not about race, but about who votes for whom. &gt;Of course. But dont pretend like all increased profit is going "to research"

It doesn't necessarily have to. It already costs about $10 billion for every drug that gets to market. I don't begrudge massive profit for the people who make the drugs that save our lives and cure our diseases. 

&gt;Every incentive is to give the bare minimum to research and as much as possible to themselves.

No research means no new drugs. No new drugs means no future profit. More research means more new drugs. More new drugs means more future profit. The incentive is to invest heavily in research.&gt;When you move, sign something with your landlord and/or realtor and have it be part of moving in

Yes, let's put the burden on the landlords, and have a process that's completely unaccountable. Plus just because you buy a home doesn't mean you live there. People showing up in person at City Hall with some proof of residency is the best way to ensure integrity of the system if we were to do it that way. It works very well in Germany. We could replace some of that with some good technology, but then you get the cries of "Poor people can't afford that..." It might work if we did it in a Democratic state though.

You see, there's nothing that can be done for voting in a Republican state that won't be protested. North Carolina cut early voting days from 17 to 10 days while keeping the same number of hours (people get later open polls, or more polls), keeping absolutely open absentee voting, and people screamed rights infringement. Meanwhile, in New York they have only one day to vote, and you need a valid excuse to vote absentee. Where are the screams of rights infringement? Oh yeah, Democrats run New York, so it's okay.They also count illegals, who can't vote, yet apportionment is done according to the census. The one circumstance that never changes is the desire for power. And we leave the non-profit scams to keep going?&gt;They also do not gerrymander just because they want power.

I see no evidence it's for race.

&gt;The Southern Strategy was about intentionally using racism to appeal to voters to win an election.

Ta-da! You got it! It's about winning elections -- power. If people are racist, play to it to gain power.

&gt;Millennials are far more likely to vote democrat, so where are all the attempts to block college students from voting?

Democrats tell me the Republicans tried it in Boone County, NC. That was again about both sides jockeying for a demographic to influence the votes -- the Democrats trying to pump up the numbers by catering to them, the Republicans trying to stop it. It's harder to do college graduates as geographic groups. With only certain exceptions, Asians are generally dispersed throughout the population too. 

&gt;Would it not be a more desirable end state to lower all drug therapy costs to the point where it's affordable

Would it no be a more desirable end state to lower all technology company costs to the point where your phone is more affordable? But they're not that expensive, because they aren't as heavily regulated by the government. It doesn't cost $10 billion to bring one phone to market, most of which is government-imposed cost. Apple doesn't spend near the percentage in R&amp;D that drug companies do, even though it's famously R&amp;D-oriented. Where's the complaining?

These are companies. They make a product, an extremely valued product that is very expensive to get through government approval and to market. If they profit, I see no issue. If doctors don't like the pharma reps, they can bar them from the premises, but they don't. Europe isn't always that great for public transportation. You have people there who live out in the boonies too.&gt;What's unaccountable?

You trust landlords? 

&gt;Personally I think adding regulation to a landlord's job isn't a big deal

That's what the said the last 100 times, and now how much regulation is there? 

But overall I just oppose the idea. If a person can't be bothered to make a reasonable effort to vote then I really don't think that person has any business voting. Here we are trying to dredge up the people who care the *least* about our system and asking them to have an influence on that very same system. If they couldn't be bothered to do anything before voting, the likelihood that they actually know what they are voting about is going to be very low. 

People complain about high campaign spending. You know what that's spent on? Trying to convince voters. Who would it have the most effect on? Exactly these people, who otherwise haven't bothered to learn anything about any issue or candidate. Universal registration and get-out-the-vote basically improves the effectiveness of campaign spending, perpetuating our problem. 

&gt;Also, re: New York:

Still one voting day, still restricted absentee voting. No problems, it's the Democrats, so it's okay. All that shows is that for-profit universities have become more popular, and people have no problem taking on debt in order to attend them. We learned at Newtown that they have people at the ready to take advantage of any such situation. Within minutes they had a fully coordinated publicity campaign going.Dear families, do not get sucked into a baseless lawsuit against the gun maker just to score political points for the anti-rights people. They'll leave you with the legal fees that will be awarded to the defendants. &gt;The trade off seems to be a little much for people against guns like me

The college was a gun-free zone. Your anti-gun laws certainly were effective against the psychopaths again, weren't they? You know what we need? More gun laws directed against normal gun owners, that'll fix it!It's called gerrymandering. Also, if you have an area with lots of blacks not voting, and lots of whites voting Republican, they want to get more blacks voting so they can win the election, not because they have some special affinity for blacks. I'm saying that if we are to impose any efficiency standard, it should be across the board. Non-profit universities shouldn't get a break on their skyrocketing tuition costs just because they're non-profit.&gt;Umm... who's Barack Obama, then?

The guy who won in 2012 after the Republican black candidate was forced out of the race. 

&gt;Black people don't avoid the GOP for no reason; they vastly object to GOP policy positions.

People often vote with their pockets, and the Democrats have been working to ensure blacks stay on the plantation. 

&gt;if only they were to modify their platform.

Self-reliance and personal responsibility aren't exactly popular terms to win elections among much of this demographic, but I don't think the Republicans want to change that part of the platform. Most marketing is to the doctors, who make informed decisions and maybe prescribe the advertised drug to their patients. They might even give you a free sample, which came from that marketing budget. The commercials and magazine ads are a small part of the marketing budget, much less than R&amp;D.The health industry is [number six](http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/) in lobby spending, and pharma companies are only a part of that, along with insurance and doctors.&gt;EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NOT MET YOU AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL, I VALUE THE LIVES YOU LOST MORE THAN I DO MY GUNS, AND I AM DEEPLY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

And I realize my guns have absolutely nothing to do with those lost lives, no more than my car has something to do with the people who got run over at SXSW.They also conflate public rampages like this with a guy going off the hook killing his family, or a gang shootout.A bunch of stuff that will just restrict regular gun owners and do nothing to address any real issues.That's a lie. We constantly collect data. The CDC is just prohibited from doing politically-oriented studies. With this restriction, they have decided to do no studies to avoid results that may not fit the anti-rights agenda.Fuck the ACLU, for if they did their job, there would be no reason for the NRA to be involved in politics.Because I believe, like George Washington did, that the parties will put their own power above everything else?When I was in printing, paper reps brought us paper, ink reps brought us ink. Did you know they make beer paper? I didn't learn that when I went to the trade shows.They've already had it for over a year, long enough for any tests. They get 45 *more* days. Whatever gives them the numbers they need.Passports can work essentially as national ID, good for everything, and not everybody has one.  A full passport (the little book) costs $110, but they also have a passport card (wallet size, only limited international use) that only cost $30. Everybody should at least get one free passport card.&gt;No pill should cost 1000s of dollars.

If it cost billions to develop and only has a limited market, meaning you may only sell some millions?Everybody does so to their benefit.Gerrymandering effectively disenfranchises voters by putting them in blocks where their vote is guaranteed to never result in a win. When Democrats create a majority-minority district, the white votes in it are Noneified.More people are killed without a weapon than are killed with "assault weapons." Everybody gets "subsidized" for their R&amp;D expenses, it's called a tax writeoff, and it's designed to encourage R&amp;D.

&gt;and favorable protectionist regulations

This is the one place where I will agree. There is crony capitalism involved here, the FDA helping to keep generics off the market, the FDA making developing new drugs so expensive that the barrier to entry for new competition is too high. But here your anger should be aimed at the government, the one you are depending on to fix the system right now.&gt;But republican voters don't care about black people.

I didn't say they did. I don't think the Democrats do either. It's a cynical view for sure, but I'm with Washington on the belief that the parties are self-serving and power hungry. I'm all for gun rights, and I know the Republicans would ban guns in a heartbeat if they thought it would put them in power. Welfare. Various incentives built into the system to encourage single moms and absent fathers, replacing the father with the state, perpetuating dependency.That does look like some expensive paper, two-sided full-color, and went through the folding machine. That was not a cheap job to produce unless they used some cast-offs. For example, we had some very nice covers for our commencement catalog (yes, that should be fancy). If there was enough paper left over, we'd make something else out of that, maybe nice bookmarks or something. You couldn't just save the paper, because it might not match what's available next year, plus environmentally-controlled storage costs money.

But I doubt that's your case. They probably just shelled out $$$. High fundraising expenses are the thing I like the least about some non-profits. The NRA is famously annoying about this. They both take in money and produce degrees. Degrees at different schools have different value in the job market. This is how it's always been.Several times I've been prescribed drugs, the doctor also handed me a coupon for a hefty chunk off the price. I've also just been handed the drugs free right there. Both of these come from the pharma reps.&gt;The thing is, these maps show that it's easier for well-off people to vote than poorer people.

No, they show that the well-off people bother to vote more than the poor people. 

&gt;If you truly think there should be an effort involved in voting

I'm not talking about serious hurdles or anything. If you're too lazy to inform the government that you'd like to vote, you really are too lazy to vote in general. It is not the responsibility of the state to overcome your pure sloth.

&gt;Universal registration still means more people voting.

It means we may pick up more of the least informed voters who don't really give a damn. On the other hand, if they can't be bothered to register, why would they bother to vote? Anybody who wants to vote can vote, if not prohibited by law due to conviction, citizenship status, or age.

&gt;And way to pick and choose your battles, re: New York.

New York was to show the hypocrisy. You only see people becoming irate over voting regulations in Republican states. They're suing in NC over shortening the early voting. Why aren't they suing in NY over no early voting? You'd think we'd concentrate on the worse offenders first.

&gt;If you truly think there should be an effort involved in voting, then let's get rid of more DL offices in white, affluent neighborhoods, so THEY can get off their asses and drive eight miles

Like how in Boone, NC, the Democrats put a polling place smack in the middle of the mostly white, young, Democratic university despite the main polling station being only a few blocks down the road, but left some rural Republican voters with at least a 20 minute drive to the polls?Love the cherry-picking car comparison. Pick a demographic where gun homicide has flatlined, and compare that to cars. Gun homicide is going down overall, but gang activity is keeping this demographic from enjoying that decline. Target the gangs, target the crime, and this will begin to drop again without passing one new gun law. CDC research on guns is perfectly legal. They're just not allowed to produce hit pieces designed to influence the political debate towards gun control. With this restriction, they've decided not to do neutral research in case it might have results they don't like. &gt;Preventing someone from voting removes that person's power entirely though which in my opinion makes it worse. 

Why? Either way, their will does not get counted. And in this case, all that's happened is that for some people they may have to drive a few more minutes (and that included a lot of whites too, but that's not worth mentioning). That's a lot less of a burden than knowing your vote won't matter at all.Dennis Kucinich wanted a complete ban on handguns, registration, ban on "assault weapons," etc. The biggest school massacre in our history was done with explosives. An ANFO bomb is quite easy to make from generally-available products. Steal a truck, fill up the back, drive it into the school lobby, boom. Forget 10 students, this takes out the whole building. Hell, school bombing was a plot point of the 1980s movie Heathers.None of our buyback programs have been shown to work. People generally turn in older rifles and pistols that weren't likely to be used in crimes anyway. Why do we concentrate on mass shootings? They make for great news, but in the end they are deaths like any other. Gun deaths were already going down in Australia before the buyback, and simply continued afterwards. In the US gun deaths have also been going down in correlation with more liberalized laws and more guns being in the population. 

In fact, look at the "great news" part. Long ago the psychos usually just offed themselves in their basements. Now they can be famous. The media turning these fuckwads into cult heroes is definitely a part of the problem. &gt;It is my feverent wish that no Democratic politician ever mention gun control. 

They don't call Obama America's greatest gun salesman for nothing. 

&gt;Ask a Republican, the Republicans own gun violence in the U.S.A. 

Much of our gun violence problem is centered around crime in our large cities, most of which are run by Democrats. If I had the time I'd make a web service that maintained a list of pejoratives, and another list of these psycho's names to be updated. Then I'd make a browser extension that replaced all mention of the names with the pejoratives when the extension finds other keywords in the web page, such as "mass shooting" or "school shooting." Ending drug prohibition would be a good start, replacing incarceration with treatment wherever the drugs themselves become a problem. That right there even saves a bunch of money up front, plus it allows the current police to focus on real crime. &gt; but in gerrymandering at least you can theoretically overcome the odds

The chances are extremely remote compared to simply having to drive a few minutes more to get an ID.

&gt;They're both highly undemocratic and need to end.

I'd love to see gerrymandering end. I'd love to see voter ID laws in every state, but implemented over the years, with grandfather clauses, in a fair way. There's nothing inherently wrong or undemocratic about voter ID, only in how it's being implemented in some places.&gt;Yes, and when was the last time that happened?

Guns are easier. Take away the guns and it will become more popular.

&gt; It also takes a good bit of money and moderate skill.

Anybody who knows how to read and isn't an idiot can do it for less than the cost of most new guns, especially "assault weapons." 

&gt;We regulate the hell out of the sale of potential explosives

It's fertilizer and diesel. You can buy ammonium nitrate fertilizer at your local garden shops or through Amazon, and if you live anywhere near rural, big bags are available at the farm coop. Diesel is at the gas station. Aluminum powder to pump it up is pretty cheap online too.It's True though. What is your exact problem? That they take in far more than they need to educate a student? Both do that. In the case of for-profits it goes to the owners. In the case of non-profits it goes to money wasted in bloated administration and other overspending.Using the inflated definition of mass shooting invented by the anti-gun people, and not the FBI's official definition, there have been 375 people killed in mass shootings throughout the entire country this year. In historically Democratic-controlled Chicago alone there have been 348 gun homicides this year, and 10 of those fall under the expanded definition of mass shooting across 13 incidents.

However, in the Chicago shootings the shooters were "unknown," which means they were gang shootings, and nobody's snitching to the police about who did it, not even the families of the victims.He asked for someone politically prominent, and that fits the definition. &gt;Blaming it on the media is like blaming it on video games and anyone doing this should be ashamed.

There's no comparison here. The only reason people do this is to go out in a big bang, make their mark on society where before they were anonymous, be famous forever. If you lessen the fame aspect, you lessen the main incentive.

&gt;The biggest school killing was in the 30s?

Yep, and almost nobody remembers it, and those who do don't remember the name. Today we have nicely compiled lists by gun rights opponents, detailing the names, the crimes, etc, with their rankings. Gotta make #1!You asked, I answered, you go off on a tangent. I have the facts, and they are not favorable to the ant-rights people. Just one Democratic-run city, one that has very strict gun laws, has almost as many killings as all mass shootings combined, even going by the expanded definition. Going by the official FBI definition, which means 151 deaths in 31 incidents, Chicago has a lot more. That is not a comfortable fact for you. 

And remember, my guns have killed fewer people than Ted Kennedy's car.&gt;the lengths some people have to go to get an ID currently.

The people who are actually having serious issues getting ID are quite rare. First, "gun safety," don't use it. Gun safety is programs teaching the actual safe handling and shooting of guns, which are promoted by the likes of the NRA and opposed by the anti-gun people. The anti-gun side does nothing regarding gun safety, it's just a catch phrase they generated to try to legitimize their program of rights suppression. 

But, Obama did order the CDC to produce a research report not long ago, and it wasn't the usual anti-gun hit piece, because the law prohibits them from doing one of those.&gt;Only because you can have a gun in 5 minutes and explosives takes more time than that.

People plan these attacks well in advance, the timing has nothing to do with it. 

&gt;Plus if you are caught with explosives, you're automatically in deep doo doo.

It won't be explosives until the day of the attack, when they combine the ingredients. 

&gt;If you had to make your own gun like you do with explosives

Explosives are a lot easier to make than guns. However the Sten submachine gun of WWII was designed to be made by the average bicycle shop using 1930s technology. It doesn't take much knowledge or equipment to make an effective gun. It won't be very accurate, and it won't last that long, but a mass shooter doesn't need either of those attributes. 3D printing is of course starting to make things much easier, and now the gun banners are starting to piss off otherwise sympathetic people by wanting to suppress free speech (the 3D print files). 

&gt;Maybe they'd be replaced with mass stabbings, but I doubt it.

China has a big mass stabbing problem.Make blacks dependent on them, keeps them in power.Again, I'd like such an investigation done on non-profits too. &gt; but it's because the NRA whipped up a False fury about him before he was ever sworn in

All indications in his record and statements were that he would have an anti-gun platform. There was nothing to think he'd be otherwise. He even sided with DC on the Heller case (personal right to keep and bear arms). Since then, Congress has stonewalled several of his attempts to restrict gun rights. His ATF even tried to ban the most popular ammo for AR rifles by calling it armor-piercing (it's not). He also deceptively conflates full-auto military weapons with civilian-available weapons in order to scare people into agreeing with an "assault weapon" ban. 

&gt;What has he actually done to restrict guns? Virtually nothing. 

Failure to do a bad thing despite best efforts to do it does not exonerate a person.Exactly. There are varying types of gun violence, and each has at its core different causes, and thus different solutions. But if you truly want to stop people from getting killed, concentrating on the problems in our Democratic-run big cities is far more effective than going after the occasional nut job. 

But saving people isn't the goal here, or they wouldn't be promoting things like "assault weapon" bans (they are rarely used to kill) and "high capacity magazine" bans (most murders are in less than ten rounds fired) which mainly serve to limit the rights of the general population. Think of this case, all it does is add a little distance for some of the people in the state. That's not really a serious issue, but it's being blown up as some mass rights violation.

However, I'm not on the side of the Republicans with this case. If you're going to require ID, any change in policy should be to make that ID easier to obtain, not harder in the slightest. &gt;They didn't do the R&amp;D behind those pills

True, but look what you just wrote:

&gt;the question about drug companies buy old licenses for drugs 

They paid money for the patents, which paid whoever did the R&amp;D. Now they wants to recoup their expenditure. Where is the concept of buying something and then selling it so strange here?Their policies in general make blacks dependent. As far as affirmative action goes, what about the black kid whose dad did go to college? Why does he get a bonus that the white kid whose dad didn't go to college doesn't have? This is basically buying votes.That means something if you think somehow being killed along with other people is somehow worse for the victim than being killed individually. If you actually care about deaths, you see how the mass murder issue is just a distraction. This freak incident is just an average weekend in Chicago. &gt;You claimed that the killings are higher in Democratic controlled cities

No, I claimed much of our gun violence is centered on large cities, most of which are run by Democrats. This is True.&gt;and if your argument is "b-b-but blue states do it too!" 

No, my argument is to point out the hypocrisy of most of those who oppose various changes Republicans have made in voting laws. They accept far stricter laws as long as it's in a Democrat-run state. It leads me to question their sincerity, since their effort is obviously to help keep their party in power.

&gt;because the only way I could register and vote while I was in Texas was to wait five hours at the DPS/DMV

Less than a minute of research tells me you can register by mail. &gt;Okay, give me an example of research on improve understanding of the public health aspects of gun-related violence which you support

Since we're talking "gun safety" it would be interesting to see one regarding the influence that regular gun safety education, especially in conjunction with shooting sports, may have on the likelihood of future involvement in gun violence. 

Maybe one on socioeconomic background and criminal history and its relationship to the later commission of gun violence. I'd really like to see the effect of increased criminal-oriented enforcement of existing gun laws on on gun crime. Maybe legalization of drugs having a correlation with gun crime incidents?

I want to see what the causes of the violence are, and what helps mitigate that violence.&gt;Cherry picking one specific scenario is irrelevant. 

Unless you're the poor kid who got screwed in that scenario.

&gt;You're not "buying" votes when the over arching goal is to help a group of people out of a nasty socioeconomic status.

Yet they don't seem to be working too well. But they're still "trying" and people still believe them, and they keep getting that welfare money and other perks, so they'll keep voting. The Democrats convinced them that their situation is entirely the fault of the man, not their own, that they're victims, and the Democrats will help them. We have a whole culture among blacks that says education is for pussies, it doesn't get you street cred (famously liberal comedian Chris Rock even joked about it). Affirmative action doesn't help with that. You said you were trying to register, not get a license. Now, if you never drive, never have had a drivers license otherwise, and needed to get one in order to register, you may have a case. Have you never had a drivers license?

Oh wait, no, you wouldn't have a case. It says on the site that SSN is good enough to register. Do you not have an SSN?None of this disputes my claim. Most of our violence is big cities, and most of those are run by Democrats. In the case of Chicago for example, it's been run by Democrats for over 80 years straight. Any institutional racism and segregation is their fault. &gt;MSNBC is an obviously skewed source

The one voice of sanity they allow at the bottom of the article asks the relevant question that they did not, "The relevant question is: how many people who WANTED to vote this year DID NOT DO SO (and reasonably could not have done so) BECAUSE of the changes in the voting rules?" This is the relevant number that is likely very small.

However, a state should make sure that this number is *zero*. Anything higher is unacceptable. They need to have an outlet, be it a grandfather clause or provisional ballots, for those who can't vote through no fault or sloth on their part. This is why I think 100% voter ID would need at least a generation to implement in a truly fair manner. You need time for all kids born after the start date to be fully up on paperwork, and you need time for the oldest generation where the birth may only be recorded in an old burned-down church to die off. 

&gt;The only way these laws are acceptable is if you are prepared to issue IDs on voting day and offer very easy to obtain assistance in getting the documents you need to get a proper ID

I'm not too sure about the voting day thing, because anyone should have reasonably prepared in advance. However, North Carolina did voter ID with a dry run, everybody who voted in the last election had to certify they had ID, and if they didn't they were directed to various sources to help them get free ID in time for the next election. That's not a bad way to do it. They still have provisional ballots for anyone who gets caught up in it. 

&gt;I wish more people would have constructive conversations around here rather than just downvote opposing views such as yours into oblivion.

Thanks. Just because I support the general concept of voter ID, which BTW is common in much of the developed world, people think I support all the machinations of the Republicans. I'm neither Republican nor Democrat, never registered for either. There were [8,855 homicides](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2008-2012.xls) in the US committed using guns in 2012. The [top 20 largest cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_crime_rate_%282012%29) alone produced 3,162 homicides. Since guns are used in about 69% of homicides (first link), that means about 2,181 homicides committed using guns in those cities if they maintain the proportion.

That's 1/4 of the national gun homicides, and those cities only hold about 1/10th of the population. That's not even a relevant question. Do homicides outside of mass shootings not count?The idea is that the policies of the Democrats have shown themselves to be no solution to the problems. That's not to say Republicans necessarily have better solutions.&gt;The NRA told a lot of whoppers

Bringing out his prior voting record, his public statements, his responses to questions, is not telling a lot of whoppers. &gt;I see, it is interesting that you finally mention institutional racism as the root of the problem

No, it isn't. But if you claim some exists, then you must fault of the Democrats in those cities. The Republicans haven't had a say in how Chicago is run for decades. Obama got his political start in Chicago, where all you have to do to win the office is be the Democratic nominee.  

&gt; and do you consider Voter ID laws to be a form of institutional racism

Not necessarily. It would depend on the exact implementation.

&gt; let's say like in Alabama where every county with a strongly majority black population has had their DMV office closed. 

Don't believe the liberal media hype. It's not about race. They didn't target black communities for closure. They're closing 45 offices for budget reasons, and the four that remain will be in the biggest cities. If you're going to keep only four, that's where they logically belong. However, in light of this cut, they should at least postpone implementation of their voter ID law until 2018 to ensure this hasn't caused difficulties. According to a study of 1,000 elephants going to water holes over 30 years, not a single case includes evidence that the elephant chose the water hole because it had water in it. 

You know, they just somehow always show up at a place with a particular attribute, but it's not because of that attribute, right? I'm not such a strong believer in coincidence.  Damn it! I went a day without learning this asshole's name. Trying to forget ASAP. 
&gt;But that still is not to say that universal background checks and better mental health funding is not needed

Agree on the mental health, but an enforced UBC doesn't help anything. People who support it haven't really thought it out, just going off of feel-goods. A good guy who wants to sell a gun to a good guy would do the check. A bad guy who wants to sell a gun to a bad guy is already willing to commit a criminal offense, so why exactly would he do the background check on someone he knows wouldn't pass? At best you get a pile-on charge whenever the bad guys are caught already having committed another crime. Meanwhile, you've burdened all the law-abiding people, and since the check is mandatory, probably caught many innocent people up in various byzantine laws. For example, due to Washington's background check law, it's illegal to let a friend try your gun while shooting on your property. That's a transfer, and no check was done. 

A proposal has been on the table from various sources, including me here long ago, to open the instant background check system to the public for free, and make it voluntary. Now all the good guys above have confidence that they're selling to good guys, but they won't be screwed by accidentally tripping up on some aspect of the law, and the criminals will still be committing what's already a crime that they can be prosecuted for. Something like this was presented in Congress, but the Democrats shot it down. They wanted to be able to entrap people in a mandatory check scheme. Well, the counterbalance to the NAACP is the KKK. The counterbalance to GLAAD is the American Family Association. Maybe Hillary wants to set up her own anti-rights organization along these lines?It already has. After I learned of his standard Democratic anti-rights stance, he lost my vote.  I disagree with him on other things too, but also liked some of his positions. This was the final straw. &gt;Bernie also advocates for gun control on the state level not federal

Does he also think gay rights should be subject to state level restrictions?Wow, express some doubt about using these warm bodies for an anti-gun agenda, and they go digging through your past. Gotta love this anti-rights crowd.They do it all the time overseas. The whole issue of mass shootings is irrelevant. More people die by hands than in mass shootings. Do you want to save the most lives, or do you want to go after mass shootings because their prominence in the news stirs your emotions? While we discuss the issue over the weekend, more people than this will die in Chicago and Detroit's regular weekend gun fire.  &gt;Of course he doesnt. 

Then why would he believe states should be able to infringe on individual gun rights? 

&gt;its over.... your side lost.... get over it...

My side won on both counts. States are being held to the Heller decision, and most famously DC is, and states are being held to the Obergefell decision. 

What, just because I'm for gun rights means I'm against gay rights? Nobody's ever heard of just being for rights?Why else would they oppose an open system?Democrats care about your color, but only if it helps them win elections. That's why the CDC is afraid of neutral research, which they could do if they wanted. Before they farmed studies out to groups they knew were anti-gun as part of their anti-gun agenda, but that's illegal now..Imagine you are a gay rights group and the CDC was farming out studies about gays to conservative Christian schools so they could get a bunch of anti-gay studies. Wouldn't you want to stop it?True, the 1A only says Congress shall not infringe, doesn't prohibit anyone else. The 2A has an absolute statement, shall not be infringed.There is no such thing as a right reserved to the states. The Bill of Rights is about rights reserved for the people, but has one that reserves *powers* to the states.It says "the right of the people," not states.The 10th is about powers, not rights. That's the one I was talking about.What about the millions of American families represented by the NRA?All through the BoR, "people" means individuals.The NRA represents the people. The NSSF represents the manufacturers.Like "gun safety" to replace gun control?It's gun safety since polling showed people were against more gun control.You can't really argue with that in the sense that someone just said something so incredibly stupid, you really have no response.Most NRA income is from members and program fees. The manufacturers donate a relatively tiny amount, a few percent.They're not all with the program yet.It's about bias used to further a political agenda using taxpayer money. The actual subject is irrelevant. &gt;You specifically use the words "entrap" and "scheme."

Because these laws are often used to railroad regular people. DC and NJ are full of cases where their strict laws were used for this purpose. Such laws also allow them to engage in selective prosecution in order to further the agenda. For example Dick Gregory was caught on TV with a 30-round magazine in an anti-gun spot, after being told by the police it was illegal, and they officially did not find it worth prosecuting. Meanwhile, one guy accidentally left a dud shotgun shell in his pocket after coming back from Virginia, and they railroaded him. 

&gt;It's bullshit. No one is scheming to take anything away from you

You haven't heard about the "assault weapon" and "high-capacity magazine" ban proposals? How about California's .50 cal ban, and their register of handguns that forbids many guns from sale?

&gt;We just want to stop the mass killings.

Do you want to stop just mass killing, or do you want to stop killings?Actually, the topic is gun deaths overall.You don't remember Manchin-Toomey and the "assault weapon" ban bills? As far as the president acting unilaterally, his ATF did recently try to ban the most popular type of ammunition used in AR rifles.No, this is how it works. Be a non-liberal, the digging begins. Remember the hordes of people who descended upon Alaska looking for dirt as soon as Palin was selected as VP? This is how it works. To be fair though, the other side does do it to some extent.The father's point was the number of guns, which actually wasn't many from a collection point of view. Nobody actually uses that many guns in a rampage, most sit unused. So there's no real difference between owning 5 and 500 guns as far as this is concerned.

Oh, he passed his background check for each, and bought these over a long period, so UBC and purchase limits won't help.&gt;It's bullshit. No one is scheming to take anything away from you

It's an absolute statement. Nobody shall infringe. Not the feds, not the states, not the cities.

&gt;It is a two clause sentence.

No, it's a participle and an independent clause. The phrase states **a** reason, the clause states an unqualified absolute. Remember, the purpose of a militia is to maintain a free state -- free as in the people are free, from potential federal government oppression. During debates the big contention about militia was the division of federal and state powers. That the people had the individual right was never questioned.

&gt;Not that the people can't vote to outlaw some kinds of weapons locally.

That hasn't been tested yet in light of Heller and McDonald. 

&gt;4 justices strongly disagreed with Heller. It will likely be revisited in the future.

Obergefell v. Hodges was also 5-4. Are you going to use that fact to say that gays shouldn't be allowed to marry?All rights can be restricted after due process for your own crimes. This is generally accepted in any discussion. That was pretty much my point. These programs have been around for ages, often funded, organized other otherwise aided by the NRA. The anti-gun people are trying to use this term in relation to gun control policies.&gt;Most of the NRA's money goes to lobbying congress.

This is provably False. [Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=D000000082&amp;cycle=2014) has their lobbying expenses at $3.4 million for 2013, a year in which they [took in $348 million](http://pdfs.citizenaudit.org/2014_11_EO/53-0116130_990O_201312.pdf). This makes the lobbying less than 1% of revenue, far from "most." What you hear from the left about the NRA, or guns in general, is usually False. 

However, I do with the NRA would install some new management that doesn't spend so much on member mailings. Even members famously are tired of it (although they can opt-out, but forget to). There are Democratic policies. They've tried and failed, but they are still policies.You'd think he would have ditched the idea the first time he heard her voice.&gt;And guess who gives them lots of money? The answer is, of course, the same people - those who pay them a lot coincidentally don't get investigated. But right now we need to focus on one in particular, the gun industry.

The civilian-oriented gun industry doesn't even give enough money to Congress to show up individually on the list of influential [industries](http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/alphalist_indus.php) at Open Secrets. Your premise just fell apart.

&gt;These manufacturers deliberately make something whose only purpose is to cause the death of other human beings.

Purpose? The purpose of many of them is hunting, and for others target shooting. As for the ones designed to kill people, they are designed with the purpose of legal self defense. You brought in purpose, live with it. A gun maker can't be faulted if an owner decides to re-purpse a gun any more than a car manufacturer can be held responsible for a fatal hit and run. 

&gt;They fuel lethal conflicts both within and without our borders.

That would be the guns that Holder allowed to flow into Mexico? Otherwise, such purchase for the purpose of foreign use is a violation of our existing law. Do you want to make it more illegaler?

&gt;every single year after 2001.

Interesting that you set your start date after a decade where thousands were killed by terrorists, and you discount the overseas deaths.

Listen to a Republican talk about "sensible regulation" regarding abortion. Do you really think he wants sensible regulation? No, their history shows anything they do is just another step towards creating an effective ban. Same here with the Democrats and guns. None of it is sensible. It's all just part of a long-established and quite blatant slippery slope.&gt;He drove his vehicle to the historic site

Obviously we need car control. This wouldn't have happened if he hadn't been able to get to the location. 

&gt;One massacre was enough.

And your legislation by emotion didn't help anything. Your murders were going down before the partial ban, and they kept going down afterwards. &gt;These people run multiple accounts and do nothing on reddit but spread pro-gun nonsense. 

You keep telling yourself that to make you feel better. Reddit seems to be a magnet for people who care about rights, and a lot of people who care about rights in the area of guns are here. 

&gt;Take a look at smell my poop and some other's histories.

So it's important to some people. So what?Just because the Democrats have failed at their anti-rights campaign doesn't mean they don't have a policy.&gt;Anyone on the right side of the isle has to pass an NRA purity test.

So? Anyone on the left side of the aisle has to pass a GLAAD purity test.

&gt; The reported revenue from the NRA is bullshit 

This is all legal documents, not bullshit. If you're going to argue with the facts, you'd better actually have some opposing official numbers. 

&gt;your claim of less influence is specious at best.

They do have a lot of influence, but it's because they have ten times the number of paid members than the ACLU. That's citizens who vote, and talk to others about issues, influencing their votes.The Kochs have been pushing sentencing reform for a long time. The world isn't one dimensional.If they 100% want to treat cars like guns, I might be able to go for that compromise. I could buy a machine gun and it wouldn't even be on the government's books because I only use it on private property. For concealed carry (in case it must be used) or hunting on public lands, you'd have to register the appropriate gun and get a license. 

Kids could be legally carrying at 16!There's no "new way" here. It's just a rehash of the anti-gun Webster's wish list over the years.The phrase denotes something that is highly unlikely, but they've been doing this for years.Irrelevant. You were talking about influence and ideology. You seem to have an inability to deal with fact. Show how those numbers were bullshit.It's because we will be acting on emotion. Your 9/11 example is a good one, because we now have the Patriot Act, passed in the fervor to do something.That's not how the NRA works. Simply reminding her of the number of her constituents who favor rights is enough.You have no right to live without fear, and the government have no responsibility to protect you.The long-time interests of both aligned. We get this all the time. The ACLU sided with the conservatives in Citizens United because they aligned on free speech.He's wanted to sign some pretty draconian anti-gun laws, but they didn't pass Congress. You are essentially crediting him for failure.Just the hit on the economy for gun and ammo sales? Billions of dollars, tens of thousands of lost jobs. 

But what do you mean "non-hunting"? [This rifle](http://whichgun.com/img/blog-posts/the-farm-brand-of-suppressed-hunting-rifles-from-aac/the-farm-ar-15.jpg), which they'd normally call an "assault weapon," was built for the purpose of hunting, to include the suppressor. I can understand typos and autocorrect in posts, but how do you do that for the story title?Collectors usually don't. This is the only one I remember having any decent collection. The Newtown asshole had to steal his.First, they're not scared of the NRA. The NRA has ten times the paid members as the ACLU, and those people vote, and convince others too. The politicians are scared of the voters, as they should be in any democracy.

&gt;Automatic minimum ten year sentences if guns are used in a crime

And here we just recently had a story about how conservatives and liberals are working together to try to rid us of the mandatory minimums that have filled our jails. Do you like mandatory minimums overall?

&gt;Mandatory training of gun usage and safekeeping

How much will this cost? Will poor people be able to afford it? If it's not free and convenient, you're violating a right. 

&gt;Automatic criminal responsibility if a gun is not secured in a home

So, punish the victim of a crime?

&gt;Mandatory gun licensing and insurance like we have for driving

Again, free and convenient. Also, insurance never covers illegal acts, so what exactly is the insurance supposed to cover? Actual accidents that hurt others are pretty rare. Or do you just want another price barrier to keep poor people and the middle class from owning guns?

&gt;Limits on high capacity and automatic guns/rifles

Exactly two people have been killed using legal automatics in the last 80+ years, and one of the perpetrators was a cop. In both cases they killed a single other individual, an act that could have been performed with any gun.

Oh, you meant "assault weapons"? More people are killed with hands and feet than with "assault weapons."

Magazines? Almost all murders occur in less than ten rounds. How is it supposed to help? Also, you do realize you're basically banning a box with a spring, right? 

&gt;We have common sense laws for driving

Only for public roads. There are pretty much no restrictions for driving on private property. Most state require a license to carry a gun in the public too.

&gt;But if we can save lives, while still allowing you to own a weapon, why not enact some common sense laws?

Please notify me when any common sense laws are proposed.

BTW, you don't "allow" me to own a weapon any more than you "allow" me free speech. It is a right I have, a right that can only be restricted through fault of my own, such as a criminal conviction. We as people in America. We've also had the ACLU defending street preachers who were railing against the evils of homosexuality. It's an AR platform gun, the "evil assault rifle." They're pretty popular for hog and varmint hunting. &gt;The states could do whatever they wanted until the 14th amendment 

Most states had their own version of the 2A. But, yes, we now have a 14th so like the rest of the rights, the states are also restricted If you're against the 2nd Amendment on these grounds, you must also be against the recent Obergefell and other decisions too.But they are, so it's True. We've seen what happens when they have complete power, and gun rights and availability get severely restricted."Assault weapons" ban, "high-capacity magazine" ban, California's "safety" list, etc. Cities with the tightest gun control laws have the most gun deaths. &gt;Minor correction, the constitution gives a right to bear arms, not buy arms.

So it gives the right to free speech, but not to buy paper, pens, printing presses, or web sites you can use to exercise that speech?

&gt;Not so much in the case of voting, where the constitution specifies the only acceptable scenario in which it can be revoked is from felons and rebels

The Constitution specifies absolutely zero restrictions to the right to keep and bear arms.No reason ever need be given for the exercise of a right.

But, full disclosure, I don't have any "assault weapons" or "high-capacity" magazines, unless you count the old .22 rifle I was raised shooting as a kid (it's an "assault weapon" in New Jersey). I'm not allowed to think about my rights being enjoyed by future generations?&gt;Is it working for you? 

Education does help. It takes a tremendous amount of ignorance to keep the anti-gun movement going, and enough knowledge easily counteracts that. 

&gt;What if the next generation elects people who want the violence throttled back a bit?

Then I'd hope they'd be smarter than this generation and actually address the sources of violence. I'd hope they'd have more respect for rights than this generation.

&gt;Do you think you can prevent the future and our current youth from wanting to live without all the shoot-ups?

I hope we can prevent them from using shoot-ups as an excuse for a massive rights violation. &gt; For instance, people can't say the f-word on broadcast television or radio stations.

That's a licensed medium. As a practical matter of basic physics, it must be licensed, otherwise everybody steps all over everybody else. What relation does this have to guns?

&gt; They can't produce or distribute sexually explicit content of minors,

They can't commit the crime of child abuse and then distribute the ill-gotten gains? Oh horrors! What relation does this have to guns? This is an example of how we hold people accountable when they commit crimes. All the anti-gun proposals target people who have done nothing illegal. 

&gt;The supreme court disagrees.

No, they don't. It simply isn't in the text. You brought out the text, now you're stuck with it. All rights have limits, when your exercise hurts others. A collection of "assault weapons" and "high-capacity" magazines hurts nobody. 
Hmmm, people involved in the gun community tend to sit on boards of organizations related to guns. How strange...Guns are seriously safe, and consumers expect them to be so. The slightest safety-related issue with a gun brings an uproar from the community, and they are recalled and fixed quickly. Even after a recall, it takes some convincing to get people to trust the brand again. Ruger's LCP could in rare occasions fire when dropped. It was recalled, and not only was the issue fixed but the whole gun was improved. Many people still don't trust it. You mean their track record that overwhelmingly opposes your political views.&gt;You can't buy a rocket launcher or a fully automatic military weapon

Actually, you can. You just need the right licenses. But we're not talking about those.

&gt;Felons cannot get guns.

Most rights can be taken away after conviction of a crime. The Democrats propose to burden those who have not been convicted of a crime. 

&gt;This idea that banning guns alittle bit more is somehow a violation of the the constitution is ridiculous.

The idea that banning abortion a little bit more is somehow a violation of the the constitution is ridiculous.

&gt;What is even more ridiculous is suggesting that requiring background checks for a person getting a deadly weapon violates one's liberty.

When it comes to universal background checks, there are two main problems. One, they won't help anything, so you are putting an extra burden on a right without it being a necessity. Second, laws as proposed have generally been written so as to ensure regular people would be committing crimes accidentally. We've learned in DC and NJ that we cannot expect discretion in prosecution over draconian gun laws. The prosecutors will fervently go after regular people who got accidentally tripped up in the law, and selectively prosecute, such as not prosecuting those who are in favor of harsh gun laws. &gt;Point is the NRA's arguments are too biased for anyone to adopt with a clear conscious.

Yet the Violence Policy Center, with a strong proven history of lies and distortions, is just fine? A politician wanted to ban barrel shrouds, and when asked what they were avoided answering, and finally said it's a "shoulder thing that goes up." No, it isn't. How can we accept what your side says with so much pure ignorance of the subject going around?

&gt;It would be like after many huge car accidents that killed people, in a country where these occurances happen at a much higher rate, each time the car companies called for less automobile regulations. 

It would be like after many huge car accidents due purely to driver error, people started talking about banning cars. Of course the car companies would oppose this.

Note that distinction: The guns are functioning perfectly. Car companies get in trouble when their cars malfunction, and they try to avoid responsibility for it. &gt;I think you have your cause and effect backwards in those cases.

Tell the same to the OP. The article starts the "correlation=causation" line, I'm running with it. But the fact is that gun laws - liberal or strict - don't appear to have much of a causal effect on crime.Not wanting our tax money used to further a political anti-rights agenda? Definitely.&gt; Earlier you were questioning if the government had the ability to regulate things we use to communicate, such as paper, pens, printing presses, or web sites. The answer is yes.

Even this regulation brought serious questions of free speech. The only way it was allowed was because of the physical necessity of licensing spectrum. It was basically a government grant of power, and that grant had limitations. 

The government would never get away with it with paper, pens, printing presses or web sites. In fact, the government tried to regulate web sites, and had it thrown out on free speech grounds. Registering presses like Cuba does would never go over here. Their identification of the printer on all printed matter so the government can track anything back would never be allowed here. 

&gt;Also guns are like speech, in the sense that they are both heavily-regulated "rights"

Speech has almost no regulation. You right now are exercising free speech on a level of power and breadth never dreamed of by those who wrote the 1st Amendment. Your "assault speech" is in no way regulated, is it?

Sure, I have to get a permit to protest, but again only for practical reasons of sanitation and *immediate* public safety. As long as I comply with the minimalist requirements, they must grant the permit. They cannot make the requirements more burdensome than is absolutely necessary for the *immediate* public safety issues. Why do I say immediate? That's as opposed to "register all your guns" and "you can't have this kind of gun." Neither of those address any immediate public safety concern. They are general restrictions not limited to any specific person or incident.

&gt;Yes, and child-porn laws also targeted people who have done nothing at the time considered illegal.

We don't have *ex post facto* laws. They are constitutionally prohibited.

&gt;Again, the supreme court disagrees with you about what is in the text

No, they don't. We both agree on the same text, and that same text does not include limitations. The Supreme Court does recognize that all rights have limitations in common law, but the infringement of them requires a pretty high hurdle. 

&gt;Until...

So you can't have free speech on the hypothetical situation that you may do something illegal with it like threatening to kill someone? 

&gt;Kind of like how drunk driving technically hurts no one

You can drive drunk all you want on private property. It's when you do it on the public roads that it becomes a legal issue. Even then, we only apply the rule to people who are actually drunk, not everybody who drinks in general. &gt;I like my guns, but that is a restriction and not one Im opposed to. 

I am not so worried about the license, but the law creating an artificial scarcity and driving the price up so only the rich can afford them needs to go.  I don't actually want one, but it's about the principle.

&gt;I have restored and sold guns and do not want to sell without a background check.

Neither would I. The problem comes with enforced background checks.

&gt;Some sellers are unscrupulous. 

And if you require background checks, then they simply won't do them. So how has the background check law helped? They're already knowingly selling to prohibited persons, which is already a crime.

&gt;we should get ahead of this thing and make sure checks are cheap and easy to do

The proposals are out there for a free, voluntary background check system. I'd definitely use it. If you do the check, you are immune from civil or criminal liability for anything resulting from the sale. When a prohibited person is caught with a gun traced to an unscrupulous seller, the law considers that the seller didn't do the check because he wanted to sell to a prohibited person, eliminating the "I didn't know" defense. Plea deal, less jail time for ratting out your seller.

Meanwhile, if I loan a gun to a friend to use on his range day, I don't get busted for an illegal transfer. That's what mandatory UBC laws do. I do believe the reason they don't want voluntary checks is that such checks don't generally suppress legal gun ownership through fear, cost, and inconvenience, which is their actual goal.I never said they were squeaky clean. We're talking about their political issue advocacy, not the company. &gt; You have to decide to become a criminal to make that sale, as opposed to people who dont mind not knowing and proliferating the gray market.

Two different models. One is "do a check or we arrest you." The other is "sell without a check at your own risk." The former catches innocents and requires a huge regulatory scheme. The latter only punishes those who actually sell to prohibited persons. And those are the people we want to punish, right?

There's no more "don't mind not knowing," it becomes "willing to risk jail." Note, the bad guys risk jail under both schemes. It is only under a voluntary scheme that innocents don't. 

&gt;I believe we have exemptions for that kind of thing.

What I just stated is not an exemption in any UBC law we have. You'd have to, in advance, think of all possible exemptions to make sure no innocents are caught, which is impossible, but not so many exemptions that criminals could use it as a loophole. This is pretty much impossible. In addition, remember who we are talking about. The goal is to suppress ownership through fear. They don't want to ensure exemptions cover all innocent acts. They want innocents to get caught to discourage ownership in general.

&gt;This is why we need to get in front of this and be a part of the legislation rather than simply trying to block it at every turn.

Opening NICS to the public, the core of a voluntary check system, was proposed in Congress by the Republicans, but the Democrats killed it in favor of mandatory checks through gun stores. &gt;They werent required to check so how should they know the buyer was a criminal? 

They sell at their own risk. It is already a crime to knowingly sell to a prohibited person, which means violating a UBC is just a pile-on charge for these people. Right no most people can say they didn't know they buyer was prohibited even though they did or suspected, because proving what they knew is hard in court. A voluntary check removes the excuse, because now the government can say he should have known because he didn't take reasonable steps to know. Along with the voluntary check system, we modify existing law to say "knowing or should have known" instead of the current "knowing or having reasonable cause to believe." 

If you want to be legally safe, you do the check. If you sell to people without doing checks, you risk jail if any one of those people was prohibited and is caught. &gt;But the nraand you should be advocating further regulations. 

Why? How about we enforce the laws we have first, maybe make them work better, before we start with more regulation that we also won't enforce very well, which will just end up burdening regular people?

&gt; if people got cars through a weak licensing/training system (or none at all)

You don't need licensing or training to use a car on private property, only on public roads. Most states require licensing and training to carry firearms on public property too.

&gt;Guns being highly lethal and easy to operate weapons

Cars kill more. 

&gt;we also need criminal background checks for buyers, but the nra is against that too

We have that for dealers, which the NRA doesn't oppose, because we can regulate dealers, pull licenses. Mandatory background checks between people won't be effective, and will only burden the law-abiding. 

&gt;Their lobbying is absolutely disgusting. 

What's disgusting is people lobbying for the infringement of rights. &gt;Usually one does have to undergo a licensing procedure to obtain an automobile or even a dog. 

No license is required to obtain an automobile, and they don't even need to be registered. That is only required if you want to drive one on public roads.

&gt;If only gun owners were held to such a high standard as dog owners.

If we were held to the same standard as cars, I could buy a fully-auto machine gun with no paperwork or license, and shoot it as much as I want as long as it's on my own property. You may be onto a good idea here. 

The funny thing is, the major impact of an equivalent licensing and registration system here would be on hunters. They already have licenses, but they'd need to register their hunting rifles when hunting on public land. I thought your type wasn't out against the hunters.A bunch of feel-good that won't help anything.

&gt;banning military-style assault weapons from the streets

"Assault weapons" account for a very tiny percentage of all murders, even less than murder by hands and feet. What's the reason to ban them?

&gt;No, that\u2019s an admission of defeat and surrender to a problem that is killing 33,000 Americans

Most of those are suicides. How many people kill themselves with "assault weapons"? How may suicidal people couldn't pass a background check?

&gt;and for a crackdown on the sale of guns on the Internet 

Does she realize it's already illegal to ship a firearm directly to someone commensurate with an Internet sale?What's the problem? We have people drinking human blood every Sunday for religious reasons.Politicians listen to the representative of five million paid members, more than any other civil rights group. Overall murder rate was going down before, kept going down after. It didn't really help. Australia has had some instances of multiple shooting since then, and it appears the real psychos have just turned to burning places down to kill people (Quakers Hill Nursing Home, Churchill, and Childers Palace).A mandatory buyback is seizing guns by force, because if you don't sell them back the next step is for the government to seize them by force.&gt; The police have the authority to question/test your driving ability regardless of it being private/public property.

I just checked my state code, and it requires that the impaired operation be on a public street or area. If they follow you through public roads to your property and test you there, you are still being busted for the public roads part, not the private property part.Sorry lady, kiss your ticket to the White House goodbye.&gt;Funny, you probably wouldn't have a problem with the government seizing an automatic weapon.

Yes I would.

&gt;I guess we're really afraid of what a crazed gunman with an automatic could do

Yet not one politician has talked about banning automatic weapons, only the semi-automatics. &gt;Some recent mass shooters had records that would have stopped them from getting guns, if we strengthened pur current system. 

We don't need a new federal law that in any way burdens the people to do this. In fact, the real gun lobby, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, has been pushing for strengthening state reporting to the federal background check system system for years. The NRA recently helped pass a law in North Carolina that tightened their reporting to the system. This wasn't a law that put a burden on the people, it put the burden on government to make timely and accurate reports, to actually do its job.

&gt;If you believe in universal background checks, you believe in further regulations.

Since I don't believe in mandatory universal background checks, then I don't. Not because I'm a nut, because unlike the anti-gun nuts, I've actually thought this through. And unlike the anti-gun nuts and their kindred spirit the anti-choice religious conservatives, I look at the possible effect on rights that any law or regulation could potentially have. If it burdens the exercise of rights, then I oppose the law. 

&gt;Cars kill more!? Barely, and mostly by accident!

Must gun deaths are suicide.

&gt;Quit being a dramatic. You don't even know what "constitutional" means. 

I didn't say "constitutional," but now that you said it, I'll tell you. The Constitution grants exactly **zero** rights to the people. All it does is try to prevent the government from infringing on the rights the people already have. I'm surprised states don't. I tried to find one that didn't, and found Illinois. Interestingly though, while you can be charged, you won't necessarily have the license suspended because it wasn't on public roads. I also see their rules about driving without a license and such only apply to public roads. &gt;Better to do nothing instead, right? 

We're playing with peoples' rights here. We can't just throw shit against the wall and see what sticks. That is no way to govern.&gt;that makes you part of the Immoral Minority.

Which became the catchphrase for the famous LA radio station KMET. They even had [buttons](http://www.cafepress.com/+kmet_immoral_minority_225quot_button,621847239).Why do people always say Lincoln? Yes, he had an eye on preserving the union, but with an "all else be damned" attitude, including constitutional rights. He even said he'd keep slavery if it would hold the union together. That is an interesting question. The Great Leap Forward killed tens of millions, but not intentionally. They just didn't care about the farmers and allowed them to starve in order to achieve their political goals. Stalin starving the Ukrainians was sort of a mix, he wanted to crush their power, and to fuel his industrialization. The Turks wanted to kill the Armenians as a group, the Germans wanted the Jews and Roma dead. Here, 

The dictionary says genocide is "the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group." So, no, it technically doesn't apply to Leopold since he just wanted the money regardless of whatever brutal means were used to obtain it. 

In a way it's worse. I can understand a hateful person wanting to kill an entire class of people, but it takes a really fucked up person to kill that many people pretty much through apathy. Goering is an interesting case. He was an upstanding man, and all accounts show he was a far more capable and intelligent person than the standard Nazi rabble Hitler had collected. Then he became addicted to morphine in the mid 20s after getting shot, and things went straight downhill. The clear-headed person you read about in Nuremberg was after he was forced to kick the addiction. &gt;Yes most of those are suicides.

Then why do you keep proposing laws that will do nothing to help with suicide?

&gt;And look at the effect Australia's recent gun laws had on suicide. 

Look at the effect Japan's complete gun prohibition has on suicide. Oh, wait, it's one of the highest in the world.I don't drink and drive anyway, don't drink much at all anymore. 

The point was that laws regulating cars are generally dependent on those cars being on public roads. You can get car, strip all the safety equipment, drop a marine V8 in it, and drive it on your property as much as you want, but it'll be quite illegal on public highways.

Even for making cars yourself they're more lax than guns. I can make a gun without a license as long as it doesn't have one of a list of various characteristics. I can make any kind of car I want, completely unrestricted, unless I want to drive it on the road. Even then, most self-made cars can be registered for the road as long as they meet basic safety requirements. Restrictions about guns are based on pretty much anything but safety. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rifle_Association). Contrast with what people normally think of as the biggest civil rights association in the US, the ACLU, which has only [500,000 members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union). It has to do with paranoia. Either can be made with either a high or low level of difficulty, depending on how much you want to make from scratch.It's still their private advocacy separate from what they have their company do. BTW, the much of the company is unionized.I don't care if she was a KKK grand wizard. She's been dead for a long time. There's probably no current management who even knew her as an adult.I was seriously thinking about voting for Sanders until he started with the "assault weapon" crap just like the rest of them.So, we are supposed to vote for an executive who blatantly states the intention to circumvent the representatives of the people? This should be scary regardless of the subject..22 is always fun, even if you regularly shoot something bigger. I still shoot the one I had as a kid. Keep up the dying tradition over there!&gt;Didn't we already have this conversation? Free speech in the US is regulated in several ways

You are vastly overstating the regulation. Free speech is subject to strict scrutiny, and as such any regulation must meet the tests of being a compelling government interest, the regulating being narrowly tailored to meet that interest, and it must be the least restrictive means to meet that interest. 

Few of our gun laws could withstand this test. 

&gt;Again, with exception to the times when gun restrictions are applied to a specific person in regards to a specific incident

Few of the gun laws proposed apply to this. They are blanket restrictions targeting everyone, convicted or not. 

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Miller

Again, you are confusing common law interpretation with the actual text. There are absolutely no restrictions in the text. it's right there, read it. All restrictions are through common law. 

However, it's funny you mention the judicial travesty that is Miller. By the time this made it to the Supreme Court, one appellant was dead and the other was already in jail. Their unpaid attorney submitted no briefs, made no arguments, he just basically dropped the case without notice. The only argument was made by the government. In the interest of justice, either another attorney should have been provided, or the case should have been thrown out. 

You want to know how bad it was? In reference to short-barreled shotguns, the Court found that, "Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment, or that its use could contribute to the common defense." This case was decided in 1939, not quite 20 years after WWI, where short-barreled shotguns were in use as the famous "trench guns" for clearing trenches in tight quarters (thus the short barrel). 

The Court made the decision based on incorrect information, supplied to it by the government that wanted its laws upheld, with no countering information available by the appellants. Yes, a travesty of justice you would be pissed about if it were on any other subject.

&gt;No, because 'free speech' refers to actions, not objects. You can't privately horde a stockpile of free speech in your basement. 

They could make certain words considered too harsh illegal. They could make means of making your speech more effective illegal. 

&gt;In many states, no you can't. 

I just found that out. It's very strange. But then some states still prohibit atheists from holding office, so we can expect some crazy laws. 

&gt;Actually, many states have zero-tolerance laws regarding blood-alcohol levels and driving.

I said in general, as in I had a drink yesterday, and I'm perfectly sober now. 

We don't ban alcohol because some people drink and drive. We don't ban speech because some people do illegal things with it. We shouldn't ban guns because some people do illegal things with them. &gt; There is a pedantic separation, but it's not as if the company is its own free-thinking entity.

So the company has feelings on the issue of sentencing? No. This is the private goal of the owners. Microsoft doesn't have a program to vaccinate kids, that's Bill Gates.

&gt;A company can't be unionized, by the way. 

You know what I meant. It means, like reality in general, this isn't as one-dimensional as you'd like to think it is. No, it's "guns 'r evil!" We just have a history of people building their own cars, and it offended pretty much nobody. Over the years, the idea of people making their own guns has become offensive to the sheep. You wouldn't believe how many people think it's illegal to make your own gun. 
After Bloomberg created Everytown top-down, he had the audacity to label it as "grassroots." Even Moms tried to describe itself as grassroots, when a seasoned corporate PR executive, likely in Bloomberg's employ at the time, had a total package ready to fire the day after a shooting.

Meanwhile, you get a bunch of normally non-political guys in Colorado who oppose a bad gun law rammed through their legislature, and they successfully take down those politicians, and the anti-gun people want you to think it was done by the NRA as an astroturf campaign.&gt;In cases like these, if students had been allowed to bring guns into campus buildings, Moore thinks things could have unfolded even more alarmingly

If they intend to do something alarming, they won't care whether the gun was allowed or not.How about a ten day wait instead of 48 hours? How about a background check? How about your choice of abortion method being banned? How about your legal status, such as being a felon, making abortions prohibited for you? You do have abortion providers effectively banned from some cities, so they can both be hard on that front.It would still be the fruit company, and there would be a drastically higher dollar value involved.They're shutting them all down except, reasonably, for the four in the biggest cities. That's not a targeted shutdown.It just shows how blind their Reagan worship is.Don't forget the billions given to universities, the arts, museums, medicine, and for nature conservancy. &gt;because nearly all existing gun laws have been ruled as legal by various courts

I stated those three criteria because they are what constitutes the level of judicial scrutiny known as strict scrutiny, and this is the level of scrutiny applied to free speech. This is our highest standard, and restrictive laws usually can't survive a challenge under it. Strict scrutiny goes so far that even having a general chilling effect on the exercise of a right is usually enough to kill a law.

Gun laws have been ruled legal only under standards lower than strict scrutiny. This is why most wouldn't survive actual strict scrutiny. 

&gt;Actually they target gun buyers and owners, who are a small percentage of the population. Far from 'everyone'

Gays are a tiny percentage of the population, so I guess we can strip them of any rights. Right?

&gt;The common law interpretation is the text.

No, the text is the text. Duh. You wrote was in the text, I countered with what was in the text. Common law by definition is not in the text.

&gt;and they have ruled several times that the rights bestowed by the 2nd amendment are not infringed by existing gun laws

Actually, a lot of gun laws have fallen when challenged. DC's laws, Chicago's laws, gone. Maryland's and California's permit laws were found unconstitutional. Texas' restriction on out-of-state sales was found unconstitutional, same for California's 10-day waiting period for existing gun owners, and Connecticut's outright ban on people formerly in mental institutions getting guns. Those are just the ones I remember right now.

&gt;In either case, they'd be outlawing actions.

I don't mind them outlawing certain actions when it comes to guns. They already do. You can't walk down the street waiving one around and pointing it at people. Nobody argues that this should be legal. The problem is you want to outlaw things that aren't actions, just as much as potential speech isn't an action.

&gt;In any case, there's a reason why the ruling applied to more than a single model of gun, and I'm going to let you try and guess why.

I think you're not understanding. The ruling was on short barreled shotguns in general, and such guns did have military use. The court's decision was not based on the facts because they only heard one side.

However, there is one interesting concept that can be drawn from it. Aside from the incorrect facts of the actual case, the Court did say that in general we were limited to owning only what is used by or currently useful to the military. Would you be willing to go with this decision? That means we the public get to have the latest automatic assault rifles (the real ones, not "assault weapons"), machine guns, etc. It means that guns that aren't used by the military aren't banned, but simply need to be registered. 

If you want to quote Miller, accept all of it. I get to buy a new M-4 at the local gun store with no extra paperwork, but I need a special license for my old hunting rifle. 

&gt;Correct! Fortunately, no one is proposing to ban all guns. 

No, they've been proposing to ban large numbers of them, and otherwise to suppress lawful gun ownership.&gt;FTFY.

No, you didn't. You want them to be one-dimensional evil characters like from a cartoon, but sorry, the world just isn't like that. &gt;It only causes a hardship for those Alabamans who don't have reliable transportation to those four big cities.

I didn't say it was a good idea, but to say it's targeted at blacks is a serious race-baiting stretch. I do think that with these cut backs the voter ID implementation should be postponed until after any impact of the cuts can be determined. When we're talking rights, we need to tread carefully.&gt;I don't mind. 

If they actually enforced it, letting your friend shoot your rifle on your property would be a crime. Luckily, the police have refused to enforce it.&gt;I just like the idea of knowing that if I sell a gun, I can make sure I'm not selling it to someone previously convicted of armed robbery. 

That's why I like the idea of voluntary and free universal background checks.The scary thing that can be taken from this is,

**They have a fucking 180% tax on cars!**&gt;People love to claim that's a pointless exercise, but it decreases the effective carrying capacity of a shooter intending to do harm.

Almost all murders are committed within 10 rounds. For the gun that was used to shoot the most people at Columbine, the shooter was only using 10-round magazines. But if you want to do just a little practice, you can swap a magazine in about a second. Pros get it in much under a second. 

&gt;Coupled with legislation that requires background checks even for ammunition and accessories like additional magazine

Most recreational shooters, and all competition shooters, buy multiple magazines. Serious shooters buy far more ammo than any of these criminals have. Knowing such a system is in place, it would be quite easy to avoid it. Most of these shootings are planned well in advance, so ammo and magazines can be bought over time. Or they can be like that Navy yard shooter -- shoot a cop with a shotgun and take his gun. But that gun was only used for the last killing. The rest were with a pump shotgun that he constantly had to keep reloading, one shell at a time.&gt;The 2nd amendment was originally made to defend the right to carry muskets, which were far more cumbersome and bulky

Would you like to apply this thinking to the 1st Amendment? A modern printing press is at least 200,000 more powerful than one of the time of it's drafting, and that's a lot more progress in effectiveness than has been made with guns. You might want to change your post. "Assault rifle" has a definition, which includes being selective fire, which means it can fire more than one round with one squeeze of a trigger.

"Assault weapon" is probably what you mean. But be careful, this is a made-up political term denoting rifles that look military-like, generally the black plastic ones. Functionally, these rifles are no different than other semi-automatic hunting rifles. In fact, you can take a Ruger Ranch Rifle, which is considered a hunting rifle and not an "assault weapon," and drop it into a plastic stock. This turns it into an "assault weapon," but functionally it's exactly the same rifle. &gt;White Southerners have been passing laws targeted at blacks for 150 years now. 

I completely understand that. North Carolina has a pistol permit system that was originally designed so that sheriffs could simply reject black applications, turning it into a de facto racist gun ban. 

But this is far too broad to be targeted. When I originally heard the story I believed the race angle, since the titles said it was a selective closing. But this is closing all of them, except keeping only the few in large cities. Even with zero racial intent, if you're going to keep only a few open, you do it in the large cities. The race angle is just too much of a stretch here. I've actually been to Denmark. It's a nice place, but I wouldn't want to live there. I knew taxes were high, but of course never encountered this ridiculous car tax. &gt;One way is to set executive wages as a percentage of the average worker in the company. For instance, if the average worker makes $50k, the executive could make no more than say x100 or $5MM. 

Two executives in two companies, both of which pull in equal revenue. Company A does cleaning, and the bulk of its workforce is 20,000 low-skilled workers who get paid a commensurately low wage, let's say $30,000 a year average. Company B does engineering, and the bulk of its workforce is 500 highly-skilled and thus highly-paid engineers, say $120,000 a year average. 

So, the guy who manages a 20,000 person company is maxed out at $3 million income, but the guy who only manages 500 people gets to take home 12 million?

&gt;I cannot conceive of a job or a financial risk that someone would take on where the payoff of 10MM per year is insufficient.

Or how about the value he brought to the company? Think of a Steve Jobs type. The company was foundering, staff was small, stock was around $6 a share, people were going to lose their jobs. But new CEO comes in, turns the company around, greatly expands it, created tens of thousands of new jobs, and the stock is now sky-high. This guy added billions of dollars to the value of the company (in Jobs' case, hundreds of billions), and you're going to cap him at $10 million? 

Aside from that, most compensation is generally in stock grants and options, so effectively their salary can be way higher than $10 million, it's just not in cash. That would be a clear violation of free speech. Whether it would be overall beneficial to society is pretty much irrelevant in that light. Rights are rights, warts and all.

However, it would be great if the news outlets came up with a sort of gentleman's agreement to do this. So, basically, he's running his companies like startups. The major difference here is that the Leaf is an electric car. By that I mean it's the dorky, gawky, not-so-practical thing that electric cars have always been. Musk gets the credit for making the first production electric car that's actually a *car*. It has the range and comfort we expect from a car, and it has far more than the performance we expect from a car (seriously, it's up there with the fastest sedans in the world). It even has far more safety than we expect from a car. And for the first time, a production electric car just doesn't look stupid. It's something that the car magazines can fawn over, that regular people who don't even care about the environment will dream of owning. 

Musk's main accomplishment is in making electric cars equal to, and even better than, regular cars. Meanwhile, without a Musk or Jobs, you just have a bunch of engineers working on various mundane tasks. Without vision, engineering is useless.The question is, who's a danger to me right now? The Christians in this Christian-dominated country don't care much that I'm an atheist, at most I get disapproving comments, and I'll likely not be elected to any office. But in a Muslim country, being an open atheist I would rationally fear for my safety. If it's statewide, it's not targeted. It may be stupid, but it's not targeted. The most effective thing is to address violence and crime in general. If you get that to go down, then gun violence goes down with it. Ending the drug war would be an easy start, then it comes to the hard problems of addressing poverty and the breakup of the family (absentee dad means a much higher chance of criminal activity). 

But for gun-specific laws, start by enforcing our current laws with a dedication towards catching criminals. Today, we expend a lot of effort busting people who have no intent to hurt anybody, and trying to shut down gun stores over minor paperwork errors. Meanwhile, prosecution for lying on a background check form while trying to acquire a gun is exceedingly rare, and we let gun stores known to be friendly to straw buyers operate for years. And one of those rare prosecutions for lying on the form? A guy was buying a gun for his non-criminal uncle so he could use his police discount, even transferred it to the uncle at a store with a successful background check. They prosecuted him all the way up to the Supreme Court, all those investigative and legal resources diverted from the prosecution of people who knowingly buy guns for criminals. 

After that, improve the reporting into the current background check system. Then make the system open to the public (with privacy protections of course), so people can ensure the person they're selling a gun to isn't a criminal.
I was down South, car very necessary. &gt;Are they likely to harm you in your country?

Since they have such little influence, no. However, my rational fear should lead me to ensure it stays like that. 

&gt;but it's more about being screwed up than about their religion. 

When it comes to Muslim countries, not being screwed up is the exception.You can, but you have to agree to travel to a gun store, spend a while filling out the form, and pay $$ to have a background check run. Why can't I just go to a web site and put in the buyer's info (and he puts in a privacy key or something), and find out for free?&gt; I did, actually. I corrected what you said.

No, you didn't. They do massive charity work in the billions, this is indisputable by a rational person. You just need to look at the facts, the numbers.

&gt; I don't think they're incapable of doing good. I just recognize that the bad they do heavily outweighs what little good they do.

See, now it comes down to your opinion of them, how much *you* weigh the various things they do. I'd bet the beneficiaries of their charity, or the 100,000 people who make their livelihoods in Koch companies, feel a bit different. New cars for the rich, used cars for the proles. I though this was supposed to be some socialist equality thing, not reserving basic goods for the rich. Sheep -- people who are easily scared by politicians pointing at something saying "We have to ban that for your safety" without having put rational thought into the proposal. &gt;If an executive of 3M can't out compete Merry Maids in terms of revenue

3M is a lot bigger than 500 engineers, add a couple zeroes. Stick to my example. The guy who provides 40x the jobs gets paid max 1/4 the salary. How would this be fair? 

&gt;Even if you are a Steve jobs type, why is a cap unreasonable?

You prevent the reward from being commensurate with the contribution to the company. 

&gt;I'm not exactly coming out of left field here according to Harvard business review

This makes the fatal mistake of connecting CEO and worker salaries in the first place. There's no rational relation, except as a "feel good" measure for those who envy success. A CEO's pay, like anybody else's, should be based on performance and nothing else.&gt;Paying money to make sure you're both doing the right thing... that's outrageous.

I bet you don't think a poll tax is constitutional, do you?I wasn't making that distinction. Call it what you want, but such societies claim to be trying to be more egalitarian, yet here you have a prime example of them reserving certain things to the rich. &gt;I looked up the numbers before I responded.

And they're quite high, aren't they? Then you go on to try to portray much of that charitable giving as non-charitable. Nice try. They give away more in a year that you or I will ever earn. 

&gt;No, it's objective logic.

No, you place a higher value on your causes, and a lower value on their contributions. Others can logically see it differently.

&gt;That is literally the pinnacle of endangerment

Calm down, Chicken Little.We don't have to cater to anybody. We're just not punishing success. It sounds like you're going more on class envy emotion than anything else. 

You still didn't refute the question of the fairness between the two CEOs. How is it fair for the one with far less responsibility to make much more money just because of his industry?No, he's not a moderate. It's still True.Then why do you think it's okay to add a monetary charge to the exercise of this right?&gt;Why? You don\u2019t have 25 refrigerators, or 25 pipe wrenches or 25 of anything other than perhaps baseball caps and pairs of shoes, and those things are questionable enough

From a utility standpoint, why would anyone want 25 wrenches? Oh yeah, they're all different, do jobs differently. I can think of at least five different rifles and five different handguns a person might want, each for a different purpose. Given a few more minutes, and maybe suggestions from others, I'm sure that could be easily expanded to 25. 

From a collector standpoint, a lot of people collect a lot of things. Is the author going to complain about the guy with any other kind of collection?We also have the concept of the "suicide mission" where a soldier knows he's probably going to die. Suicide covers anything you purposely do to cause your own death, regardless of the actual agent used. &gt;and his target is any sensible gun control, no matter the death toll

You'd have a point, if he had ever targeted a sensible gun control bill. The guy is a total nut and I do wish he'd get kicked out, but the Democrats haven't put forth one sensible gun control bill that any advocate of rights should support.Sorry, wrong guy.&gt;There are differences in CEO compensation based on industry already

That is completely irrelevant. This is about a government-enforced cap on salary, not about what people may naturally tend to earn.  So, why should the guy who runs 20,000 workers get paid 1/4 of the guy who only runs 500 workers solely because the government said so?

&gt;I'm suggesting that there is no reason unlimited income is a service that society should offer

Society isn't offering it. The people are earning it from their companies.

&gt;If we were going off of actual social value, nobel winners would be billionaires

Different people value things differently. In a quite authoritarian manner, you want yours imposed on everyone. &gt; the closing of planned parenthoods are statewide, that doesn't mean they aren't targeted to strip rights away from women

That's designed to kill an entire service. You're telling me the state is trying to kill drivers licenses? That's absurd.

&gt;as it would always affect the most vulnerable citizens (poor and minorities). 

The ones they're leaving open are in their largest cities, which have high concentrations of poor and minorities.Under Oregon's law it does, except for a very specific list of exceptions. &gt;even though Muslims make up 0.8% of the population? 

Thus the "ensure it stays like that" part.

&gt; I think there are probably better things to worry about.

Small worry now to avoid a big worry later.

&gt;Most Muslim countries are still recovering from the impact of Colonialism

That's right, blame it on whitey. It can never be their own culture's fault. He supports an "assault weapon" ban, a "high-capacity magazine" ban, and the ability of cities to infringe on the incorporated constitutional rights of the people. In addition, he has also stated that the sale of the vast majority of handguns, and many rifles and shotguns, should be banned.

These are extreme anti-gun rights positions. Have you heard him speak? He's a little out there to be our representative. At least Ted Nugent is funny-crazy. &gt; if you seriously think it's simply a coincidence that the state passed a voter ID law right before it shuts down 31 offices, then you're blind

No, I simply forgot my tin foil hat. Not everything is a conspiracy. If they had actually targeted various counties throughout the state, I'd definitely see a conspiracy.

&gt; doesn't change the fact that 41% of the population still lives in rural areas

And most of the poor are left in the cities that do have DMVs. That kind of destroys the whole "targeting the poor" claim. A ban on anything is an extreme position. The poll blows it immediately by using the loaded, made-up political term "assault weapons." It plays on ignorance and fear generated by the extreme anti-gun movement. I bet a second question of "What do you think an assault weapon is?" would show the problem with that question. &gt;And no you cannot buy the exact kind of rocket launchers that the US military uses or the exact kind kind of fully automatic weapons that the US army uses.

No, you can't, and that again helps prove my point that gun rights are more restricted, even though Miller said we have a right to such things.

&gt;Which once again proves that we place restrictions. And that placing ANY restriction does not violate the constitution.

Restrictions **only in consequence of a person's illegal act**. Your side proposes restrictions on people who have not committed any crime. That's the huge difference.

&gt;But it is clearly not a violation of the second amendment. 

Based on strict scrutiny, it would put a chilling effect on the exercise of the right to keep and bear arms. It is not the least intrusive method of achieving the government's goal. Therefore, it should be found unconstitutional under the strict scrutiny that should be used when reviewing any right. Unfortunately, some things have slid through since the most any court has used is heightened scrutiny (just below strict). The Supreme Court dropped the ball on Heller by not stating a level of scrutiny to be used.

&gt;What about Connecticut? Gun killings fell by 40% after they implemented mandatory background checks and training.

Connecticut also implemented a huge program of extra policing around that time, and officers there credit that program, not the gun laws. Better policing always works. Laws that only the normally law-abiding will obey, not so much. That drug dealer on the corner is getting his guns through the gang's gun supplier, and he's not going through training. 

But, you completely avoided my point. The laws in DC and NJ have often been used to prosecute people over minor innocent violations. People have been sent to jail for having a dud shotgun shell, or transporting legally-owned guns from one house to another. The prosecutors go after such innocent people as if they were hard-core criminals, while avoiding going after the actual hard-core criminals. But this is selective. David Gregory wanted to show an illegal 30-round magazine on the air in DC to promote the anti-gun cause. The local police told him no, it's illegal, but he did it anyway. Although the police wanted to arrest him, the anti-gun politicos who run DC declined to prosecute this knowing and willful violation of the law because it agreed with their agenda. Meanwhile, they went full-bore on that guy who forgot he had a dud shotgun shell in his pocket.

This is what your laws do.

&gt;So this idea that we cannot do anything better with background checks is absolutely False.

Unless you can assure me 100% that nobody without criminal intent will get caught up in such laws, and that they will not place significant time, cost or convenience burdens on otherwise lawful transactions, I will oppose them. However, voluntary background checks with a carrot and stick approach is a good idea. 

And really, you're going to quote a paid-for study by the **Bloomberg** (yes, that Bloomberg) school? That place is basically his factory for anti-gun hit pieces, headed by anti-gun hit man David Hemenway. While I do agree on the general concept of domestic violence restraining orders if due process is strictly followed (remember, that constitutional protection applies to gun owners too), there is far too much room for their abuse. Want to get back at your ex? File a restraining order. He'll lose his guns for at least six months, and have to go through hell and much expense to get them back, probably in bad condition. However, there's little provision for punishment for the False claim that violated his rights, and where there is, there is almost no chance of prosecution. The anti-gun people don't care about such a blatant violation of rights, as long as they're gun rights. Anyone who Falsely claims such a thing should be tried for a prison-time felony and be vulnerable to civil suit by the person she wronged. The feds should bring federal civil rights charges against her. 

I know cases where women got restraining orders against violent men, and those men should not have had guns. But I also know a guy whose girlfriend took out a restraining order against him for assaulting her while he was in another state far away with family the entire weekend of the supposed assault. After he had to prove his innocence (a travesty in our justice system already), the judge just let the restraining order lapse. Nothing was done to her for her False claim, not even a contempt charge. 

&gt;The [FBI has also been very critical of our current background check system

The gun industry and the NRA have been pushing for better reporting into this system for years, and this better reporting would have stopped the sale. The NRA even got a law passed in NC that forces better state reporting to the system, with short deadlines. What has your side been doing to make reporting better? No, you just want another law that burdens the people further rather than make existing laws more effective.

However, what's your stance on drugs? Should they be illegal? The flag he had was on simple drug possession. If drugs shouldn't be illegal, then he never should have been flagged in the first place.

&gt;But we can implement common sense background checks and gun training.

When a gun-rights advocate hears "common sense" gun regulations, it is just like a pro-choice advocate hearing the Republicans talk about "common sense" abortion regulation. In both cases, we know there is a very real movement behind it to seriously restrict our rights regardless of the veneer of legitimacy they try to apply. To take from a current liberal theme, it "triggers" us. &gt;All most people want is that dangerous people cannot get guns.

As a general thought, I would call this a centrist position. However, Sanders goes much further than this. For example your statement focuses on the legal status of people, while most of Sanders' proposals focus on the type of gun. He also shows no care for whether his proposals could violate the rights of people, while he is very sensitive that any proposal affecting abortion may infringe on rights. Along that line, he cares if states are infringing on abortion rights, but has said that he wants a system where states are allowed to infringe on gun rights.

&gt;t's not going to artificially inflate prices. 

Background checks from reputable gun stores generally cost $40 and up. Where they are required by law for all transfers, they can run over $100 because of the captive market. That's pretty significant for a gun that may be selling for only $200.

&gt;74% of NRA owners support mandated background checks on all guns

They had no way to verify any of those 129 people who responded positively were NRA members. The NRA did not give them a member list to validate against. Yes, 129 people out of a sample of 169 that supposedly is representative five million NRA members -- if they were indeed members.

&gt;81% of republicans support backgrounds checks for public and private gunsales

They support the general concept, not necessarily any bill that has been introduced. I support the concept too, but on a voluntary basis that doesn't catch innocents in byzantine laws. Politifact is taking gunsrcool as a legitimate source. They've hit a new low in the trustworthiness of their ratings.We already have a lot of restrictions.It's insanity to increase the scope of background checks without first fixing what's wrong with background checks.If you're a black man open carrying at an Obama rally, the MSM will turn you into a white racist.&gt; Further left than that, you could still hear remnants of the old '60s arguments that gun control is racist

You can hear this across the political spectrum. Our gun laws are heavily tooted in racism. This was blatant all the way through the 1970s bans on Niggertown Saturday Night Specials and the current restrictions in heavily black cities.We already have lots of federal restrictions, and most states have further restrictions, some of them quite draconian.Standard gang shooting, and I guarantee nobody saw anything, and will still dare to not lay any blame for the violence at their own feet.None are less lax than the already strict federal restrictions, at least not any attempts that have been upheld in court.

And remember, lax means liberal.Except on the campuses where guns have been allowed for years, this has not happened once. It's the latter one they should have avoided. They have redefined long-held terms to fit their agenda. They even include pellet guns in their shooting list to pad the numbers.Last time Dresden housed this many refugees we bombed the hell out of it.Given the history of grc, I'll disbelieve anything they are mentioned in until it is proven.

I'm not saying the numbers are necessarily wrong in this absurd and meaningless comparison since they did use good sources. The problem is using grc, which is instant discredit.How about all Utah public universities.It's a personal opinion, doesn't require evidence.What I said actually happened.Public mass shootings of this tend to occur in gun-free zones, so that cuts down the chances.The idea of mandatory carry is as abhorrent as prohibited carry.Why should the USPS have to make money? It's a service that the Constitution provided for. Due to its anti-gun agenda, any study the CDC commissions will be done by an anti-gun researcher, such as Hemenway. This researcher will start with the unsupported premise that gun control *does* work, thus tainting the entire study from the beginning. In the end, he will have ranked all of the methods according to their correlation with a drop in gun violence. He will not actually find causation. His control will be non-existent, or completely fabricated. Places with a high correlation between strict regulation and gun violence (DC, Chicago, etc.) will be ignored.

It is this kind of study that is banned because it is designed to promote a political agenda.&gt;but that would require a bit more work than just an executive order

That would require wanting to do good, and improving our system without a further burden on the people. Such thinking is not allowed.That is the intent.&gt; affect the prices of guns in a way that limits their ownership to a smaller, more educated and less crime-prone demographic

Evil Republicans want to fuck over the poor again! Oh wait, this is Democrats talking.&gt;The way I see it should be retailers not the makers..

Under current law, a retailer that knowingly sells guns to criminals or straw buyers is not protected from a lawsuit. They are only protected as long as their business is conducted lawfully. To try to destroy a very good law that ended politically-motivated nuisance suits, the anti-gun people purposely distort what the law does in order to build support for ending it. &gt;Keep in mind there have been more than 9,000 gun violence murders this year alone

There were fewer than 9,000 all of last year. I haven't heard of such a huge increase in gun murders.

But in general, the guns are stolen, bought using straw purchasers, or they are guns that have already been in criminal circulation for a long time. They have their own markets set up, and the only background check is the street credibility of the buyer.It's funny how each side likes undercover videos when it's for their own cause, but not when it's for one they don't like. Most other government services are money losers, supported by taxes. Except Galaxian was actually fun to play. Not going to spend the extra money to get the optional cassette with the magazine?

However, the ones I typed had what was basically a BASIC loader program, and a huge block of hex code that actually comprised the game. I liked the new stories. It's like watching different action movies.Yep, but the Constitution give Congress the power to "establish Post Offices and post Roads." We seem to think it's normal for the government to build roads out of tax funds, but any tax money supporting the Post Office is somehow wrong?This definitely is not covered under the self-defense statutes, and this woman needs to be investigated. This is why I don't agree with constitutional carry. People need to be taught the legal circumstances when they can fire, and when they can't, and licensing ensures that law-abiding types do get this training. 

&gt;The shooting comes just weeks after a bank customer in Warren opened fire on an armed robber, 

That would fall under protecting people from immediate harm, so this guy's a hero.When it comes to guns, people are so quick to take away a constitutional right. I would say she should definitely lose her carry license since she can't be trusted to carry in public. Maybe she can reapply - and retrain -- after a few years, after she's convinced a court she's learned her lesson. But this is no reason to revoke her right overall. There's no indication of violent felony tendencies or dangerous mental health issues. She just seriously overreacted. Notice how carefully the article is written to avoid even using a pronoun in relation to the shooter that would identify her as female. Other articles state it was a woman, so this information was available.&gt;The shooting victim was able to flee for help in time though

That's a really screwed-up agenda to call this guy a victim. Arabs love their little white Toyota trucks, and for good reason. That's most of what I saw over there. The latest [official data](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-11) is 2011, and 12,000 is **all** homicides. Guns were less than 9,000. Politifact twisting numbers to arrive at the result they want? Say it ain't so!&gt;Licensing ensures nothing. 

I'm talking about the licensing I'd like. Other states do cover the legalities.&gt;I like any undercover videos that are not fraudulently produced

The target will always claim fraud. That's what the factory farms do. But unlike the factory farm video makers, these guys released the full-length videos.$150 on a cheap used gun, or everything you own during a home invasion, plus probably medical bills, and counseling after the gang rape. Make a choice.[This story](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2015/10/06/customer-fires-shoplifting-suspect-auburn-hills-home-depot/73467882/) is from around the same time as this one, and they knew it was a woman. That's a really cool idea.
&gt;Still, according to your source more Americans were killed by gun violence in one year than in the entirety of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined! 

And if you remove a small number of big cities from that statistic, which tend to have tighter gun laws than the rest of the country, this number would go way down. Also, our guys over there were all armed and able to defend themselves.A story that doesn't follow the lines of "white male shooter" just doesn't jive with the media program. They even caught CNN lightening the face of the Oregon shooter to make him look white. They thought a post office was important enough to put it into the Constitution, but somehow that's now allowed to be tax supported.If somebody is threatening another with serious bodily harm or death, and this in case that includes anyone in the location of an armed robber, then deadly force in return is proper. &gt;planned parenthood videos were not only incomplete

They release the whole video too.

&gt;The factory Farms don't claim fraud either

Even [animal activists](http://www.all-creatures.org/articles/ar-outlaw.html) admit the farm industry claims the videos are selectively edited, and that's a reason given for the ag-gag bills. I've never seen one of these groups release a whole animal abuse video though. &gt;They're right around the chances of using a gun in a way that actually harms you.

Somewhere around a million defensive gun uses per year, and the poor don't get to be part of that? They're the ones most at risk. 

&gt;99.9% of the time buying a gun is just a waste of money for people that have none. 

You don't get to make that value judgment for others regarding their right to protect themselves.  I would say some people are pretty stupid spending a lot of money on guns they can't afford, or anything else for that matter, like shiny rims or TVs. However, we're talking about the government purposely making guns more expensive, and that policy targets the poor. &gt;the US patent office charges fees

But the USPTO isn't required to turn a profit either. We're not threatening to sell it off if it doesn't turn a profit. I don't have a problem with fees, I have a problem in that one of the few agencies we have that is actually constitutionally provided for is required to be self-sufficient.&gt;Anti-theft devices on guns, specifically bio-metric locks, are designed to prevent unauthorized users from using your gun. Its as simple as that.

I'm going to start with a logical condition of any such device, that they must not be less reliable than the guns themselves. Military standards require a failure rate no more than 1 in 500, or 0.2%, in combat conditions over the course of 20,000 rounds. Most guns do much better than that. On the civilian market in clean conditions, really we're not amused until a gun fires 2,000 rounds without failure. We're not impressed until 10,000. It must also be able to be handle sustained freezing temperatures and sustained hot temperatures, and of course wet and muddy conditions.

There is no such system on the market that has failure rates this good in those conditions. Apple's quite advanced fingerprint reader isn't even this good, and it's downright horrible in wet conditions, even if the finger is just wet (as fingerprint reading tends to be). This doesn't even count the active interference with the system. RFID is extremely low-power and on known frequencies, so it's a quite easy task to make a pocket-sized device that can jam all RFID devices in a 100-foot radius. Forget RFID locks. 

&gt;Small electronics are now smart and cheap. 

Small electronics that can withstand tens of thousands of high-g force impacts, plus vibration, and heat are quite expensive. Why do you think they only made that RFID gun in .22LR? 

I'll believe such guns are ready for the civilian market after the military and police eagerly adopt the technology on its merits. So far, any such proposal to mandate them excluded police and military. Until then, I'll just say people have been watching too much Judge Dredd.They aren't. That's why they need to go to known anti-gun researchers to get the results they want. It's part of the MSM theme that gun owners are all white male. &gt;First it's a conspiracy to hide this person's gender then it's a conspiracy by the media to hide the race of non white male shooters?

It's the overall media theme that gun owners are white male, makes it easier to demonize. They even tried to make people think a black open carrier at an Obama rally was a white racist guy through selective editing. 

&gt;the majority of mass shootings, in America, are by white male shooters.

Then why when it's not a white male do they try to hide the fact? &gt; She just started a history of endangering people in a public place

She had no criminal intent, no intent to commit illegal violence. She thought she was doing a good thing. There's no question of mandate here. The government runs other unauthorized departments purely on tax funds, so why can't tax funds be used to prop up the Post Office, which is authorized? The Post Office is required to serve every citizen in the US, and this includes quite unprofitable routes. FedEx can opt to serve only the profitable routes, and thus make money.Just because Clinton has finally said one truly rational and reasonable thing doesn't mean I'm voting for her. The court was extremely patient with the crazy lady, and jail was a last resort, just long enough to allow the court's decision to be followed.Certainly the Leaf fits the paper requirements of a certain narrow demographic, including mine to be honest. But still, it's a funny-looking, wanna-be thing that's not really a car in peoples' minds. To put it in South Park terms, it emits far too much smug. The Tesla is a badass car in every way that just happens to be electric. 

As far as price, Tesla is doing the opposite of the tradition. People have been making low-end electric cars for a while, and they've generally sucked. They couldn't build a really nice car and keep it affordable. Tesla is starting at higher prices so they can actually build really nice cars, to get people used to the idea of an electric car that's actually a nice car. After that, they'll start pushing down in the market using the road-proven technology they developed in the expensive cars. Expect a pretty nice and reasonably affordable electric SUV from Tesla in a couple years.&gt;These people aren't helping responsible gun owners.

Like MLK didn't help responsible blacks through his exercise of peaceful civil disobedience of unjust laws?There's no confusion. I'm wondering why there's so much pressure to force the constitutionally-authorized USPS to not use tax dollars while we support all these other non-authorized agencies with tax dollars. If anything should get our tax dollars, I'd say we should start with constitutionally-authorized functions. &gt;It's been illegal for the better part of a century to produce fully automatic weapons 

It was legal all the way up until 1986. and it's still legal with specific licenses.

&gt;illegal to purchase a fully automatic weapon for almost thirty years

You can purchase one right now, absolutely legally, but it must have been made and registered before the 1986 cutoff.

&gt;Your line is further away from the general public

Using you as an example above, the general public normally draws its lines in complete ignorance of the facts. You're debating on the subject, not just answering a poll, and you completely blew the two facts you used to start your post.

I don't put much value in completely uninformed opinions. I especially don't appreciate opinions being swayed and then calling the newly created opinion as center. The politicians and press made up up the vague and meaningless term "assault weapons" and then demonized them as more powerful (they aren't), more deadly (they aren't) and a favorite of murderers (they aren't). Then they do a poll asking people if they think "assault weapons" should be banned, and then use that for support of a ban. 

No, that's not valid. It's one of the biggest push-polling scams ever.

&gt;You are on the fringe.

Me knowing the facts certainly puts me on the fringe these days.

&gt;Sanders is at best left of center on this particular subject. 

Anyone who is calling for a ban is at worst an extremist, at best ignorant. 
Given that they have a mandate to service unprofitable areas, I can understand some subsidizing. We have a lot of law that requires this universal service, especially in the legal process. Even the blacks don't have an MLK of their own anymore. You just get the career race-extortionists like Jackson and Sharpton. That's how it is, blatant manipulation.&gt;Well in fairness the smart gun you are specifically referring to, the Armatix, already surpasses those trust standards.

Cite the testing, please, and the testing of the RFID system to include its ability to resist interference.

&gt;And they are making a 9mm version. 

It will be interesting to see if they can come up with something competitive against the array of quality handguns already available, and whether they've fixed their susceptibility to jamming. They have an engineer who worked for HK, but he can't exactly steal the HK designs. 

Since they priced their mediocre .22LR pistol well above that of a high-end HK pistol (the ultimate in reliability), I can only imaging how much they'll charge for a 9mm. &gt;Sure, if you consider the majority of the American populace a "narrow demographic" sure

You count only commuting, not commuting plus daily driving, and the trips outside of those parameters that often happen. Most most of my daily driving is under 20 miles right now. However, I do occasionally do a trip about 70 miles away and back, and there's no quickcharger to get me home. It's also quite possible that I may have to commute much farther in the coming year, and if I go short-range electric I've screwed myself in advance, sunk a lot of money into a now useless car.

&gt;but your claims are little more than you internalizing ICE Auto Manufacturers' propaganda.

I have only practical concerns. I'd absolutely love to have an electric car that really fit my needs now and into the future. Leaving any environmental concerns behind, the cheaper fillups, instant torque and relatively low maintenance would be wonderful.Intent usually goes into sentencing. The question is whether she's still a danger to society. &gt;I'm also a gun owner.

Do your fall into the FUDD category? In this case, they're protesting quote onerous background check system practically designed to entrap people.&gt;the fact it's authorized is irrelevant

It absolutely is for for my argument. We should first an foremost fund those functions specified in the Constitution. 

&gt;you also have to ask yourself if the post office serves a function that warrants the costs of operating it

This is the basic question, and the answer is clearly yes. Like I said, universal postal service is required by many other functions of government. Until every single person is securely and regularly online, and all relevant government functions have gone digital, we need this service. 
&gt;One of those exceptions is letting somebody shoot your gun when you're with them though. 

My bad, I was confusing Washington and Oregon. Washington won't let your friend shoot your gun on your own property. 

&gt;It's still bullshit that you can't loan a friend a rifle for the course of a hunting season or something though. 

I think Washington does have that exception. &gt;If I'm not dead, trapped, or crippled I try to find a working vehicle and attempt to drive as far away from the path of the fallout as possible. 

That's not necessarily the right thing to do. There is a calculated thing called the optimum time of exit. Basically, it's a combination of the factors of the radiation level, how fast levels can be expected to fall, your current level of protection from the radiation, and the level of protection you will have while attempting to depart the area. Depending on these, there is a certain amount of time after the explosion where leaving will result in the lowest radiation dose. 

For examples just to help understanding, if you're in a basement and your escape method is an open-top Jeep, you might want to wait it out a bit because you're well-protected now, but you'll get fried out in the open while escaping. If you're in a tent and your escape method is a steel-bodied car, leave right now.

The military has a [handy calculator](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/86/ab/86/86ab864709c20826d9d3fac8a3c74606.jpg) for this actually. &gt; it has nothing to fear as they can continue operating as they see fit after being released from the shackles of congress.

Except not being able to compete due to the expense of meeting their universal service requirement. FedEx and UPS don't have to deliver everywhere, the USPS does.&gt;California and Massachusetts do require that a firearm, to be sold there, pass a shooting test.

I stated the military test and what the gun-buying public expects. This is more relevant than what two gun-unfriendly states have done.

&gt;\u201cWe tested the iP1 with more than a quarter million rounds,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can use it in rain, dust, and mud.\u201d

So the gun itself is up to industry standards. What about radio interference? There's no reference to testing for it. One big thing to note with Armatix is that they tried to sell this technology to various police and military customers, but nobody wanted it. Why should we want it?

&gt; Drawing on breakthroughs in mobile technology, the trigger is released by similar fingerprint sensors to those used in Apple's iPhone 5S.

And it's still nowhere near reliable enough. The "rain, dust and mud" above would significantly increase False negatives for any current fingerprint system. Apple's even more advanced TouchID in the iPhone 6 still can't handle a wet finger. All guns can handle a wet finger and radio interference, so adding these systems makes the guns much less reliable.

&gt;Those sensors are approved by the FBI, and widely found in security scanners.

Indoors, controlled conditions, where a False negative doesn't have the potential to cost you your life. If you get rejected, just wipe your finger and be more careful about finger placement on your next try. You don't get this option in a self-defense situation. 

&gt;The gun is enabled in under a second from first contact

In self-defense drills with an attacker 21 feet away, you get 1.5 seconds to draw and shoot. Anything less than this, and a moderately well-trained shooter will have his attacker physically upon him. Any enabling time not measured in low milliseconds is unacceptable.

I've heard quite a bit rational. Doesn't mean I'd ever vote for a Scott Walker type, or Fiorina. You're supposed to stay with the script! Who the hell didn't pre-interview this lady so we'd know her answers?Flipping context is a classic tactic of this crowd. It gives the sense of plausible deniability so they can get FactCheck to get them "True" ratings when the actual intent was to deceive. I do not give them the benefit of the doubt here. We're expected to believe this?That's a lot of money.No, the goal is to enact gun control. It assumes an unproven premise that gun control is the best means to reduce the number of deaths by firearm.This is income actually earned overseas, and we are the only major country to tax overseas income.It would have no impact on the deficit, because with increased revenues the government would just increase spending.All of it.

This is the second story I've read on this, so I already knew it was a woman. &gt;Robbers want money, they don't want to kill if they don't have to. 

You threaten a life, you are subject to being killed for doing so. Any one person in a situation may decide to comply (and many are still killed anyway), or to fight back. I'm normally not in the business of second-guessing someone else's life and death decision. &gt;The truth is, there was "one justifiable killing for every 32 murders, suicides or accidental deaths" in 2012.

Most defensive gun uses don't involve a shot being fired, much less a death. 

&gt;Claims that guns are used millions of times each year in self-defense are unTrue

You really link to something by the Violence Policy Center, a group known to lie and deceive constantly in pursuit of its agenda? And you add Hemenway, who gets paid by Bloomberg to put out anti-gun studies?

&gt;So I ask again, why do you want the poor to spend money on something that they don't need and which won't help them get out of poverty? 

I want them to have the option to if they want to. I don't want the state to eliminate that option through unnecessary added costs. 

&gt;Actually, my value judgement is, you have a right to self-defense.

Apparently not the poor. Serial killers tend to not use guns, too quick and impersonal to provide the gratification.&gt;I think in that situation, part of defending yourself and the innocent people around you is keeping the situation from escalating.

There's a guy there threatening to kill everybody. it's already escalated. One good shot is about the quickest de-escalation you can get. &gt;You are forcing the armed robber into reacting violently

At this point we really don't care about the robber. 

&gt; it's going from a situation in which the guy might just leave

Might, or just start shooting people, as has happened.

&gt; into one where at least one person is going to get shot

The robber instead of an innocent victim.If he chooses to actually take the money and leave.&gt;Create a smart-gun that is just as reliable as its dumb-gun model counterpart in everyway, shape, and form. It should be as reliable or better.

Technically, it could never be just as reliable. You're adding an extra point of failure, so any failure rate no matter how good will make it less reliable. However, a failure rate of the whole system together that's in line with industry standards could be interesting. 

But you have to remember the main problem here: A failure at a bad time can get the gun owner killed. This is not acceptable, which is why manufacturers have been pushing failure rates down as much as possible. You wouldn't believe the obscene abuse an HK45 can go through and still function, through thousands of rounds, to thousands of overpressure rounds, to thousands of seriously over pressure rounds. Then they purposely stovepiped a round (leaving the bullet in the barrel) and shot another one after it. This easily blows up a barrel, but for the HK it made a bit of a bulge, and it was a bit less accurate afterwards. It would be nice to see the "smart" components of the gun be able to survive similar abuse. You do that, I'll be highly impressed.

Another example is stress tests, where we see how well a gun fares with multiple rounds shot quickly through it. With 1,000 rounds through a Sig P320, they noticed the frame had started to melt due to the heat, but it still fired. Can the "smart" system handle that kind of heat? 

&gt;The cost of the smart gun must be similar in price to its dumb-gun counterpart, the same price, or cheaper. 

I really don't care about the cost. As long as it's not government-mandated, the market will work itself out on this. But if they want it to work in the market the additional cost needs to be low. 

&gt;Prove it is reliable to the public having police and/or military adopt it.

That's the big one. So far, military and police have not been very keen on the idea. It's just one more thing to maintain, one more thing to fail. 

&gt;Anything else I should add to the goal list?

Uptake of the technology must be purely on its merits through the free market. What brought protest against these guns in the US was not the technology itself, but that its presence on the market triggered a law mandating only "smart" guns be sold.

&gt;Another thing that I think hunters would be very interested in is automated sniper spotter. 

You may be thinking of the rifle that was built with a scope that has a laser rangefinder, etc., and if you put the crosshairs on a target it will adjust so you do hit regardless of range, elevation, etc. It can also track the speed of a moving target, and calculate the appropriate lead. It's $20,000, and you have to buy their expensive bullets because the system knows the ballistics. 

&gt;Though that system is already obsolete thanks to the DOD's laser guided bullets. 

For some perspective, a regular dumb 155mm artillery shell costs a couple hundred dollars. The precision guided version of that shell costs $80,000 (maybe $60,000 if they went into more mass production). This bullet is a .50BMG, and the cost for match-grade ammo starts at over $5 per round.What if, what if, what if. We are not there. We don't get to second-guess.It would be nice, but the CDC won't like the results. That's why they farm their studies out to places they know will produce the results they want. When forced to do a neutral study by Obama during this restriction on political advocacy, it lost the usual anti-gun slant. That is True, but strange. A bomb would be much more effective. We are kind of lucky they tend to use guns.&gt;You don't think it's a good idea to consider the consequences your actions?

My actions, not second-guessing someone in a life-or-death situation. Me, personally, I'd hide if I could. Even a clean shoot of the bad guy means a lot of crap I would have to deal with. But I'm not there.

&gt;I don't know what you mean by this.

Are you currently in tahat armed robbery? No? Then you don't get to decide what any one person in it does to protect himself. A single jackass parent is preferable to, well, nothing. Anybody can be a jackass. If you have have one parent, and he's a jackass, you lose. If you have two parents and one's a jackass (same odds as single parent), you still have a good parent. If you have two good parents, that's better than one good parent. Is this like a requirement in DC or something?I always use a pressure cooker anyway.&gt; We all know that APPLE evades taxes. 

Kind of differently. Apple doesn't do this royalty flipping thing to move what are essentially US profits offshore. Their offshore money is made by selling products offshore, products that never touched US soil and are sold by foreign subsidiaries.The biggest school murder was in Bath, with explosives.&gt;Oh no, this is it, the slippery slope towards polygamy

If polygamy works for some, I have no problems.I don't really care about taxes in those countries. The point is that this shell game is commonly used to effectively hide US income, especially where software and patent royalties are concerned. Apple doesn't play that game. Overseas income is actually overseas income, however they do their taxes there. Huh? That's not Hitler's bloodline. That's Alois' bloodline. And if we didn't tax overseas profits like most other countries don't, Apple would owe nothing. It's their artistic work, it's their copyright. If you want a work-for-hire arrangement that assigns the copyright and originals to you, then put that in the contract. It'll cost you more for that concession though. As far as Muslims in the Middle East are concerned, Islam is politics. The religion is their law, their government. They don't separate.&gt;Fingerprint scanner and really fast processors and whatnot. But what are they used for? 

Most people don't lock their phones because it sucks to have to enter a PIN every time. The fingerprint scanner the way Apple did it built biometric unlocking into the button you normally use to turn on the phone. Now almost everyone with such a phone probably locks their phones. This is not only great for individual security, but now thieves know that new iPhone is probably locked, and will be bricked if they try to access it after theft. This would tend to suppress theft. The new phones have even faster fingerprint scanners, meaning that pause when using your phone 50 times a day is now gone. 

As far as processors, that depends on what you do. The ability to take and edit 4K video is important to some. But one thing it does help for everybody is to create a much more fluid UI, free from various hesitations, stutters, and input delays. This vastly improves the user experience. The UI difference in responsiveness between my 2013 Android work phone and my newer iPhone is night and day. It's downright frustrating to use the work phone.&gt;If it's dodgy to do it for US taxes

I don't think it's dodgy at all, since we shouldn't be taxing overseas earnings in the first place. If other countries have a problem with their tax structures, that's their problem, not ours.

&gt;It's almost like you think Apple is less dodgy in how they avoid tax?

Certainly. It's one thing to avoid a tax that you shouldn't be paying in the first place, on overseas profits. It's another thing to shuffle assets around, turning what is really US profits into overseas profits in order to avoid taxes. Apple does the former, not the latter, which Google does.

Microsoft even does this within the US. Their software is licensed out of IIRC Nevada to avoid the Washington tax on software licensing. MS doesn't actually do any real licensing business there, it's just a shell company that technically owns the licenses to avoid taxes. Ha Ha. Two simply do better than one overall, proven. I haven't seen a study on three vs two though. Like many things in the world, there's a sweet spot. Under that too few, above that too many. Two seems to be it.[FM 3-3-1](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/army/fm/3-3-1_2/Ch6.htm#s1)Most are religious based and use Sharia law.&gt;This royalty income isn't income earned in the US either 

That's not the trick. Let's say you have some copyright central to your business. You move it to an overseas company. Then the US company has to pay royalties to the foreign company, turning what should have been taxable income into a deductible expense. Apple has products made in China and sold by subsidiaries in other countries, generating overseas profits, and these shouldn't be subject to tax in the first place. I understand Apple does things to reduce the legal tax liabilities for these sales, but that's not my problem. &gt;Which is what robbers do in damn near every robbery.

And that robbery where they don't, you'd deny a person self defense?Most of it is black on black crime, doesn't count. There is an interesting angle. Tell the cops what's going on. Maybe they'll let him do the buy, and say to the clerk that he's buying it for the other guy who is prohibited. If the pawn shop lets the sale go through, we get a bad gun store closed.

But the idea that they purposely attacked a True hospital is absurd. They'll rely on the fine print in the contract of course, but it's flat-out deceptive trading practices to use an absolute term like "unlimited" and then put a limit on it.

Freedom from government oppression, it's what the US was founded upon. That includes government oppression of the old, blacks and gays.He is correct on this. Just before Hitler really started cracking down on the Jews on Kristallnacht, he disarmed them. The Weimar Republic had gun registration, so the Nazis had a nice list to go off of. &gt;  If they were advocating for an outright ban on gun ownership

That is the end goal.

&gt;The vast majority of Americans support some additional forms of gun control

The latest polls show people preferring rights over more restrictions. 

&gt;I do not see what is wrong with having that conversation.

It would be nice to have a conversation about what we can do to best reduce violence in this country. Instead, they want useless stuff that will only suppress legal gun ownership, such as banning a type of gun that's used in fewer murders than hammers are. That's after they were fully militarized. This was back when they were still consolidating their power. &gt;They will just claim what they always have, that unlimited only means that you can connect and stay online for an unlimited amount of time.

No, they market unlimited as opposed to having a data cap, so they are talking about data usage. 

&gt;Unlimited never meant unlimited bandwidth,

That's never been offered. You only get the bandwidth you pay for.The Jews lived throughout the country among the rest of the population, being rather well integrated into overall German society. They were only herded into ghettos after they were disarmed. The Nazis had gained control of the government, after which they set about to crush all resistance. Ensuring the least armed resistance possible was part of that program. &gt;Nowhere will you see anything that states you get unlimited bandwidth/data transfer

They advertise unlimited data as opposed to a cap such as 300 GB. I have never seen them advertise unlimited time online, because all broadband is a constant connection. My whole point is False advertising when terms buried in the contract contradict the advertising.&gt;Well yeah, hammers are used for things besides killing people

So are guns.

&gt;Also, Americans are split when flatly asked if we need more gun control. 

Two problems with this. One, rights aren't subject to polls. Two, most people answer poll questions without even knowing the facts surrounding their answers. The answers are from ignorance. 

&gt;Universal background checks for ammo purchases - 55% support

First, this is a massive imposition on a right. Remember, we think a simple poll tax or literacy test is unconstitutional. And the criminals will just go to the local gang reloader. Oh yes, bullets can be reloaded.

&gt;Assault weapon ban - 56-62% support

Assault weapons are used in very few crimes despite their demonization. This will not help our gun violence problem.

&gt;10-bullet magazine limit - 56-60% support

Most murders are committed within 10 rounds. Again, this will not help our gun violence problem.

&gt;More security guards in schools - 64% support

That's not gun control.

&gt;Armor-piercing bullet ban - 67% support

Then their heads explode when you tell them that almost every hunting rifle round out there can pierce a bulletproof vest, thus this would make the vast majority of hunting bullets illegal. For rounds designed for handguns, armor-piercing is already illegal. So, what exactly is such a ban supposed to do?

&gt;Government records of all gun owners - 66% support

You mean government records of all law-abiding gun owners. The criminals won't register. If you catch them with an unregistered gun, they're already in felony possession of a handgun. At most you get a pile-on charge, but no deterrent for criminals. 

&gt;Increased penalties for illegal gun sales - 75% support

The penalties are already quite severe. The problem is we don't enforce this very much against criminals.

&gt;National database tracking all gun sales - 78% support

Again, only sales among the law-abiding. The underground market will continue unfettered.

&gt;Universal background checks for gun purchases - 86% support

Which will have the main effect of entrapping well-meaning people in its byzantine provisions. Those who are already willing to commit the federal felony of selling to a prohibited person aren't going to care about a small pile-on charge of not doing a background check.
&gt; I like my guns, but this has always been a nutty argument. 

Look how hard a time the most powerful military in the world had in Afghanistan and Iraq.

&gt;Youd be better off pointing out Japan was nervous about attacking the mainland US because we were so well armed.

That's actually fake, he didn't say that. However, it is quite True that it would happen. &gt;reiterate a long-standing request that those private dealers who sell a sizable number of guns conduct background checks on buyers. 

If you're a dealer, you're in the business, and need a license. He probably wants to say anyone who sells more than one gun a year is a dealer.Why did Hitler find it necessary to disarm them before cracking down on them?&gt;The Weimar government actually had much stricter gun control laws than the Nazis. The Nazis relaxed gun laws for most groups, aside from persecuted minorities obviously.

This still goes with the idea that in order to suppress a group, you ensure they don't have guns. It's not just the Nazis, it's SOP all over the world. &gt;Okay. What's a practical use for guns besides killing things? 

Killing things is a practical use when it comes to hunting and self defense. Aside from that, yes, most guns are used to punch holes in paper or ding steel targets. At this level, it's a sport like any other. What practical use does an Indy car have?

&gt; Fortunately none of the proposed regulations are rights in themselves

All but one restrict a right.

&gt;Mass shootings aren't

Columbine, the idiot with the 10-round magazines and pump shotgun (load one shell at a time) fired many more times and killed more than the one with the 50-round magazine. Naval Yard, shooter used a pump shotgun, then shot a security guard and stole his pistol. BTW, are we limiting police and federal security guards to 10 rounds too in order to stop that?

And remember we're talking gun violence. Mass murder is a tiny part of it, just hyped in the media. Anything that specifically targets that isn't going to help much overall. This magazine limit was a big thing before mass shootings were on the gun banners radar, so this is just a new justification for an old desire to limit people.

&gt;No it isn't. It was already passed in New York with no constitutional issues.

Actually, part of that was struck down in state court. It hasn't hit SCOTUS yet.

&gt;Also, you're confusing a right to bear arms with a right to purchase them.

Do you realize how ridiculous this sounds? It's as contrived as a Republican on abortion. In fact, that's their whole program now, with the right to an abortion, make sure nobody has access to an abortion clinic. Does your side share strategies with the Republicans on this?

&gt;Any given model of gun is used in a minority of crimes. 

We are talking about an entire class of guns that are very popular, millions sold every year by dozens of manufacturers. They are not the gun of choice for crimes, yet they are the main target of gun regulation that laughably claims to be aimed at crime. When you bring suicide into the mix like they like to, these are almost never used for suicide either. 

&gt;A massive number of criminals bought their guns legitimately, such as the majority of mass shooters.

Registration won't help with this. These people intend to die after the carnage. What are you going to arrest them for? And if you do get them before they kill themselves, you're left with a small pile-on charge in addition to several death penalty offenses. It doesn't really help.

&gt; and the purpose is to increase penalties upon any underground market.

Penalties would never apply to people who buy when legal and then commit a crime. It's registration. The underground market is already committing the crime of selling to criminals, no need for a pile-on charge that mainly serves to punish the law-abiding. 

&gt;Except for all the times that they do. 

The main place your desire to register falls flat is the fact that constitutionally a criminal cannot be required to register, and cannot be punished for failing to register. That would be a 5th Amendment violation, admitting he illegally possesses a gun. Not only are the law-abiding the only ones who would register, they are the only ones who have to register.

&gt;Similar to how DUI laws are just another pile-on charge for people committing vehicular manslaughter under the influence?

Not even close to similar. A DUI is a separate crime usually prosecuted on its own. Against criminals, this crime would only apply in cases where another crime has already been committed. It would only be a standalone crime on the otherwise law-abiding, and I thought we were going after criminals?

&gt;Yes, and lots of mentally ill people and criminals are "well-meaning" when they try to buy guns.

I'm talking about how, for example, Washington's UBC makes letting your friend shoot your gun on your property illegal. I'm talking about how a museum realized its employees would be made criminals for handling the weapon exhibits. 

&gt;How would someone know that they're selling to a prohibited person without doing a background check?

That's why we need free, quick, and voluntary background checks. If you look at gun ads, they are already full of people who want to see a concealed carry license before sale. The desire among law-abiding people for such a system is out there. For the law-abiding we add the assurance of immunity from civil or criminal repercussions if the gun is used in a crime, and leave the bad guys liable. We can even amend current law from "known or have reason to know" standard for selling a gun to a criminal to "know or should have known." And if we have a free background check system, everybody "should have known" unless the sale was due to a failure in the background check system. Everybody could have arms, they just need to be registered. Hitler started cracking down on Jews during his rise to power, using this registration system to know who to target. One he gained power, he then completely stripped them of arms, two months before his famous anti-Jewish speech at the Reichstag let them know what was really going on.

At the time of the final disarmament, the military was already committed to occupying Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the Rhineland, and preparing to get quite busy in Poland. As the Holocaust went on, the military was increasingly strapped for resources on the Eastern, Western and African fronts. What armed Jews would have faced was the Gestappo, a police force. They faced it anyway, but unarmed.Comcast used to advertise free, but with a quiet cap they tried to keep people from knowing about. Then when that cat was out of the bag they made the cap official. But now in many markets (maybe not yours) they offer the "Unlimited Data Option," which is still subject to their acceptable use policy and "network management" (they used to throttle data using that excuse). &gt;How did it work out for the Polish army? 950,000 strong with high grade military weapons.

The Jews would faced the Gestappo, not tanks. The army was busy elsewhere. And if the Germans had been forced to reallocate military resources for internal suppression, that would have helped our war effort, ending the war more quickly. 

&gt;The Jews would of been killed in their homes if they had fought much.

Instead, they were shipped to the death camps to be slaughtered.It's different in most markets. They get away with what they can. I'd love to see their policies in a market serviced by Google Fiber. End the drug war, focus on education, more opportunities for youth to keep them away from gangs, encourage two-parent households (removing welfare encouragement of absentee fathers), more jobs. Lots of things can be done that will reduce our overall violence rate, and gun violence will drop with it. I'm a fairly libertarian person, and ending the drug war is a very libertarian policy, but I realize some of the real solutions require socialistic polices. If you're talking about the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, that was five years after the German Jews had been stripped of arms. It was mainly occupied by Polish Jews, and the Germans didn't have a convenient list for them to confiscate arms, although they of course tried. They were already severely weakened, had few weapons, no supplies, and were completely surrounded, but they still managed to keep the Nazis busy for a month and take quite a few with them. Imagine a fully-armed resistance of well-supplied Jews not weakened through years of starvation. 

The larger Warsaw Uprising was a year later. The Polish resistance smuggled in guns to the city so that the uprising would occur *in conjunction with* the Soviet attack on Warsaw. It was never meant to be successful on its own, but as part of a larger battle plan. It was designed to give the Nazis two fronts in Warsaw that they couldn't handle. 

However, the Poles had a second objective, which was to consolidate Polish control over Warsaw so that the Soviets couldn't claim it after the war. The Soviets probably realized this objective, because as the uprising started they stopped right at the city limits and waited while the Nazis stopped the uprising. They not only refused Soviet air support against the Germans, they wouldn't even let Allied planes land in the Soviet Union after dropping supplies for the Poles. The Soviets waited a few months and then drove the Germans out, and killed or imprisoned the surviving poles who had fought. &gt;In the vast majority (nearly 50 of the 60 or so in the past 40 years) mass gun murders

Remember that this is also a very small minority of all gun murders, it just gets hyped up in the press a lot. The regular weekend gun violence in Chicago and Detroit claims more lives than your average mass murder, but nobody really cares. &gt;The Weimar government passed strict gun legislation

They required registration, which the Nazis used for selective confiscation. So much for the concept of "good corporate citizenship." Then we make payment to the company based on the level of recidivism of its released inmates to change the incentive.The problem is that generally the shareholders are you and me. If you have a retirement account, you're probably a pharma shareholder. &gt;Students are there to learn from teachers, not listen recruitment propaganda

As opposed to all the other propaganda the average student is exposed to?The attempt to take their guns should have been the first clue. &gt;How do you be sure a dangerous person isn't released, then, because the jail realized it's more profitable to release people than hold them?

They don't decide who gets released, the state does. Overall, they make more money by people they release committing no more crimes. Still, I do think the private prison concept is strange. Of all the things the government should do itself, it's prisons. &gt;Weller said he supports more gun control "but the site is just data and is no more political than a phone book."

He created the site so that politicians like her can point to a really big number, one much bigger than the official number that's too low for the ant-gun people. It is very political. They were even caught using pellet gun incidents where no serious injury occurred to inflate the numbers.

This should have been rated "False," but Politifact has a bit of a bias on this, tends to give that side a bit more benefit of the doubt.There is definitely a perverse incentive built into the system. OTOH, it will always exist. Either it's a CEO wanting to make money, or it's the head of the government prisons bureau kingdom building. I would say the former is worse though. So, did Everytown recruit from GrC, or was GrC a Bloomberg astroturf project?&gt;The Jews didn't have any guns to confiscate, the "selective" part. 

Yes, they did, initially. That's how they were on the Weimar gun registries, allowing the Nazis to know exactly where to go to confiscate them. &gt;there will be no built in incentive for them screw everything over.

That's actually the kingdom building I was talking about. It's common in government. The theoretical advantage of private companies running prisons is that the government can just cut the contract if they screw up. It's much harder to fix entrenched government bureaucracies. But in practice, the government's having a problem dealing with contractors who screw up.Read the first sentence,"It\u2019s not hard to get your hands on illegal guns and rifles in America"Hundreds of thousands of armed resistance is nothing to /s at.Because it mainly affects the law-abiding. People who don't mind committing the crime of knowingly selling to a criminal aren't going to care about the checks.&gt;What do May 2, 1933 and Republicans (notably Scott Walker, John Birch Society) have in common?

It has more in common with Sanders. They created a national trade union that ensured things like paid holidays, and instituted massive public works projects to ensure everyone was employed.I wouldn't put that past them.It's not equal. These illegal dealers are already committing federal crimes, so background checks will not be a deterrent. Only those with no criminal intent would be seriously affected, especially if they get caught illegally letting their friend shoot their gun on their property (that's a transfer, requires a background check).

Mandatory UBC mainly serves to suppress lawful gun ownership, and I know that's the intent.You tried to equate, I did too.&gt;Consider the processes for buying and carrying a gun in Roseburg, Ore., the site of a recent school shooting, and in New York City.

In Roseburg, where people rarely get shot, and in New York, where people get shot all the time.The government constantly collects data. The CDC is allowed to research, just not allowed to produce anti-gun hit pieces designed to influence the political debate.GI bill would probably require a law change, but the military can simply declare any business off-limits for troops, and bar them from post.Pro-gun tends to be grassroots. Anti-gun tends to be astroturf, Bloomberg and his Everytown and Moms being prime examples.No conspiracy needed. The corporations constantly attempt insane overreach of copyright.I'll teach defense of shooting looters.&gt;Reducing the amount of guns available would eventually lead to less gun crime, look at Australia.

It didn't work in Australia.&gt;the takeover of unions in Germany had nothing to do with helping workers

They got vacation days and jobs thanks to the Nazis. 

&gt;Just like their efforts to split or destroy mainstream Christian church influence now.

Like pushing gay marriage so that some churches split over the issue?&gt;Great, so can BB guns.

So? That's completely irrelevant.

&gt;Aside from sporting events, none. Which is why they're not street legal. Great example

But they're perfectly legal to own without restriction. 

&gt;Again, none of these things have been considered unconstitutional by the supreme court.

They haven't all gotten to the Supreme Court yet. I've already given many examples where their laws fell in courts though.

&gt;Yep, that's two. You're leaving out a couple hundred other mass shootings.

You made an absolute statement that I disproved. And don't use the GrC definition of mass shooting.

&gt; If it isn't the laws that are causing the wide gulf in gun violence between America and the rest of the world, then what is?

We have a drug war and a generally pretty violent culture. We also have this cult hero thing going on with mass shooters, which just encourages more of it.

&gt;Actually, it was voluntarily withdrawn by Cuomo as part of a compromise with the republican state congress.

Incorrect. A federal court voided the 7-round magazine limit.

&gt;Even people in states with the most restrictive gun laws can still get guns legally, hence their right to bear arms remains intact.

They banned handguns, the people could still get rifles and shotguns, thus their right to bear arms remains intact. That thinking was shot down.

&gt;And again, there is no model of gun that is used in a majority of crimes. 

This is the second time I've had to correct you. This is about type of gun, not a specific model. "Assault weapons" comprise many models among many manufacturers. The type of gun used to commit most crimes is pistols. Rifles are rarely used, and "assault weapons" are only a part of the larger rifle category.

&gt;Many military-grade weapons

What exactly do you think this means? 

&gt;It's because of their potential to inflict mass harm, and their lack of practical necessity for self-defense purposes.

[This](http://www.ruger.com/products/mini14RanchRifle/images/5801.jpg) and [this](http://www.ruger.com/products/mini14TacticalRifle/images/5846.jpg) are functionally the same rifle. One has no more potential to inflict harm than the other, but the latter gets banned under "assault weapon" bans. Older rifles of [this model](http://www.marlinfirearms.com/images/photo_60.jpg) are "assault weapons" under New Jersey law. It's a .22LR used for target practice and hunting squirrels, and is common as a kid's first learning rifle. Oooh, such potential to inflict mass harm!

Self-defense experts have been touting the AR-15 as a great home-defense weapon since it's light, easy to use, has low recoil, and good magazine capacity over pistols and shotguns. It easily accepts useful attachments such as flashlights, and can be customized to the need of any person. It has been used many times for home defense. The ease of use and customizability even make them popular for the disabled. The sad thing is that it would be even more useful in the home with a shorter barrel, but you need a special license and more $$$ to own one due to stupid regulations. 

&gt;By that logic, why keep murder illegal?

Because it constitutes actual harm to someone else. Buying or owning a gun isn't.

&gt; Such as the Americans who take advantage of loose gun laws to buy firearms in bulk and then sell them to the cartels.

You mean how our government allowed them to be sold to the cartels, which is otherwise already illegal. Gun shops wanted to stop these purchases, but the ATF told them to let the sales go through. The cartels get their best guns from defecting military and police in Mexico, and through the arms trade coming up from Central American countries. They use automatics a lot, and they don't get them from US gun stores.

&gt;If someone is punished under the law, then they're obviously not law-abiding, are they? Unless by "punished" you mean "inconvenienced". 

I'm arguing against laws existing because they do little or nothing to stop crime, and the acts are in themselves not harm against other. You want things that used to be legal to be made illegal. This is turning regular people into criminals when they've hurt nobody. Worse, most gun laws are designed so that people will accidentally break the laws, and these instances are vigorously enforced as if the people were career criminals.

&gt; You seem to have it in your head that gun laws "don't count" as real crimes.

They create made-up "crimes" and are arbitrary and capricious in nature. This Rifle A has a 1/4" shorter barrel than the Rifle B. Possession of Rifle A without a license is illegal. Magazine A has an 11-round capacity, Magazine has a 10-round capacity. The first metal box with a spring is slightly too long for the law. 

&gt;If everyone acted this way, we wouldn't need such laws. Unfortunately, many people do not, and that's primarily who the proposed law is intended for. 

The people who do not already have intent to commit the crime of selling to a prohibited person. How does your added charge help anything?&gt; If you're saying it only affects the law-abiding then lets do it and see what the result is

We're dealing with a right here, where you don't just throw shit against the wall and see if it sticks. You need to have a very specific logical path whereby crime will be lowered with the least possible impact on rights. 

A person who would knowingly sell to criminals isn't going to bother doing a background check, so the law is ineffective on him. But that's what laws are for! We punish the illegal acts! He doesn't do a check, he gets arrested! It's a deterrent to crime! But selling to criminals is already illegal. We can already arrest him for the sale. So what does a mandatory background check accomplish?Despite any rhetoric to the contrary, both sides want an authoritarian government to control society. They just want to control it in different ways.  Next time a conservative talks about the need to reign in government power, agree with him. We need to cut those onerous regulations on abortion clinics.&gt;that if wanting less national tragedies in the form of very very popular enforced background checks

He passed a background check. How is this supposed to help?They passed gun legislation in North Carolina. It liberalized concealed carrying and allowed hunters to use suppressors. It also raised some penalties for illegal use of a gun, and greatly tightened up reporting into the background check system to include mental issues, plus a strict time limit for the reporting. Overall quite the intelligent gun law. Meanwhile, the feds just keep proposing stuff that won't help, and mainly cracks down on the law-abiding. They tweak the stats to ensure abortion stays low. Say a woman come in for an abortion. They give her a pregnancy test, some counseling, an abortion, and she walks out with birth control. She went for an abortion, but PP arranges it to count as several services offered, diluting the abortion visit in the statistics. In reality, if you count people going into a PP, more than 3 of 100 will be going there for an abortion. 

However, I almost can't blame them for this deception, which wouldn't be needed if Republicans weren't on an anti-abortion crusade. Just say 12% of patients get abortions, and it comprises 50% of clinic income, and be done with it. Nobody cares. &gt;then you should be liable/negligent for the harm caused by such person getting a hold of the gun

This is already the law in many states.

&gt;These individuals would have to pay a fee as well, and once trained would make an oath to protect people from harm's way.

This sounds interesting as a high-level license, almost a deputized sort of thing. But regular concealed carry is designed for self protection, doesn't need the psych exam, and already usually includes ethics/use training. As it is, concealed carriers are one of the most law-abiding demographics in the country, in Texas even better than the police. 

&gt; least given preference to individuals who have served in the military

Most of the military's training is for killing people in war, not protecting people in peace. It's not really applicable, a completely different mindset. Also, many in the military have barely touched a gun, especially in the Air Force. Just being military doesn't guarantee any better suitability for this role than a moderately-trained civilian.It may be difficult to buy the rifle, but the suppressor is available off the shelf. Why we restrict hearing protection, I can only ascribe to politicians watching too many spy movies. First, not fired from military, she was a contractor. Second, I really can't see this happening, nobody really cares about your religion, and lots of people from lots of different backgrounds work in and around the military. If it did happen though, heads will roll. It would have to be an intolerant attitude generated by the head of the clinic. Did they serve fish sticks?It's not about Plan B. It's about actual abortions. A simple search will show you this from many sources, but here's a [random one](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/12/for-planned-parenthood-abortion-stats-3-percent-and-94-percent-are-both-misleading/).Waiting for that White House invitation...The funny thing about statistics is that they can be technically correct and still be used to mislead people. They downplay the number of abortions, but in reality that's a big part of their business. What was the purpose of that woman's visit to PP? Abortion. What was the main income from this visit? Abortion. How was that visit counted? Several different services, one of which is the abortion. &gt;Jobs making the Nazi war machine at low wages.

As opposed to no jobs with extreme inflation? 

&gt;I do have a problem with outside dominionists using homophobic lies and propaganda to split other people's churches to gain political power. 

You mean churches that were doing just fine until the gay activists started convincing some in them to be more accepting of gays, thus starting a split?Which is the precursor to confiscation.The space gun looks of the Beretta Neos call to me. I'm not sure how good it is though, but I haven't heard bad like I have the Sig.Remember that criminals are the only people who don't have to register their guns.Now let's have the government forbid you from using the Internet because it doesn't like what you're saying. You can speak, just not through that medium. It's not infringement, right?The purpose of the recall wasn't to give those seats to Republicans. It was to kick out those politicians, and it succeeded. You want middle ground? Remove suppressors and short-barreled rifles from the NFA and give us national concealed carry reciprocity. Now that you've moved to the middle, we may be inclined to do so.Deutch would have a conviction under his belt if not for the pardon, and that was a government computer, not private like Clinton's.&gt;from a reputable agency as if that's how science works.

No kidding. They bring out that Hemenway drivel with supposed Johns Hopkins credibility.The companies are actively opposing this. Al Gore tried extortion back in the 90s to try to get this access, but it didn't work then either. Sometimes they genuinely give up, but they will always try again.His was government, at his home, but not approved for classified information. Clinton had the info on her own computer. It's a little worse.If you think vast infringements on rights are just fine, then there can be no agreement here.&gt;Doing nothing has clearly failed,

We do a lot, but we could try better enforcement of current laws, use them against the criminals. But we don't.

DC has tried registration, background checks, heavy restrictions, etc., and they still have a very high gun violence rate. "Just doing something" doesn't work. You have to do things that actually address the problem. And when you're talking about a right, "just doing something" is usually unconstitutional. &gt;Many pro gun people live in the suburbs and don't get lulled to sleep by small arms fire in shitty neighborhoods.

I was raised in a gang area and was later moved out to the wild. I learned to shoot while in the former, didn't even think about hunting until the latter. My parents just didn't point to the guns the gangs had and said "See, guns are bad." Instead, we went shooting as a family activity. Many families do the "guns are bad" thing, so the only context the kids ever see guns in is with violence, and generations are raised like this. I understand the thinking, but it's still based on fear and ignorance.The slippery slope is already well-established, so it isn't a fallacy.Many of them are, that's what Bloomberg is doing. This is a top-down organization created by PR experts, pretending that its support was generated by the people instead. That's astroturf. 

Think Washington, where Bloomberg bused in and paid signature gatherers to get that anti-gun measure on the ballot. Then you have Colorado, where just a regular guy started a movement that grew into getting a few politicians out of office. The mom of Moms Demand Action is a former high-level corporate PR executive who owned her own PR company that she ran from home ("stay at home mom"). She supposedly created an entire anti-gun movement the day after Newtown out of concern as a mom. Right. She was most likely paid by Bloomberg to create the movement and launch it after the next incident. 

NICS is run by DoJ. You're talking about opening NICS to the public. With some privacy safeguards, this is a great idea as long as checks remain on a voluntary basis.Again, the numbers are technically correct, but they spin a False story they way PP arranges them. Face it, abortion is a big part of their business. You know this to be True. This is what they try to hide with the 3% number. 

As people have said, this is like Major League Baseball claiming it's really in the hot dog business and not the baseball business because they sell far more hot dogs than they have baseball games. &gt;Gay marriage will work out just fine.

Of course it did.

&gt;Guaranteed by our Constitution, supported by a vast majority of people who believe in individual rights. 

Guaranteed under general rights provisions even though it's not explicitly in the Constitution. Meanwhile, the right to keep and bear arms is explicitly in the Constitution, partially to retain the ability to rebel against tyranny, and people don't think that right should exist.

But the point of this comment is that the church split is the fault of the pro-gay people. The churches have traditionally condemned homosexuality and gay marriage, not because of modern conservatives, but because that's the traditional reading of the Bible. They've been condemning homosexuality since before we had a country. But people are starting to become more accepting of gays, and they have been introducing this concept into their churches. This is the source of the split, not conservative propaganda.&gt;Countries that get rid did of guns rather than just making them slightly inconvenient to contain have far less gun violence.

But not necessarily less violence.

&gt; It's time to have a serious discussion about the albatross that is the 2nd

Law enforcement thinks it's time to have a serious discussion about the albatross that is the 4th. Think of the number of crimes we could solve if people didn't have the right to be free from warrantless searches! If we could throw the bad guys in jail without a trial, then we could clear up our gang problem pretty quickly, which would greatly lower our gun violence problem. 

&gt;I see basically no public good that is routinely conferred.

Around a million defensive gun uses per year. They are what gives the 80 year-old grandma greater force than her 20 year-old attacker.I was talking to an ER doc, and he said people who don't have emergency issues and could walk in simply call the ambulance because ambulance riders get seen without the wait, or because they want a free ride."Shows up to fight back" = "Shows up with the intent to fight back" = "Good guys with guns have arrived"Think of it like the military. You were assigned to live in this new district, often not of your own choice, but you maintain your "home of record" which determines where you vote. &gt;At the end of the day I don't care. Facts: abortion is legal in the US

I didn't say I wanted them shut down. In fact, if you read earlier, you can see my criticism of those who want them shut down.

&gt;Which has never been shown, even with the near constant investigations and "undercover videos". 

One state investigation found that PP was not selling fetal tissue illegally, but they only investigated a clinic where they destroy all of their fetuses (and concluded they did so properly), never donate. The investigation was completely irrelevant to the charge, didn't even come close to investigating it. But people can now say "The state investigated, and PP was found to do nothing illegal." The elephant in the room is that Glocks are really ugly guns. Who would want to pimp one up, put lipstick on a pig? &gt;CDC researchers were advocating for gun control when their results suggested, for instance, that having a gun in the home was more dangerous than not having one

The study in question was absolutely horrible in many different ways. It was an extremely shoddy piece of work, commissioned in order to promote the gun control agenda. You don't do a hit piece that bad unless you're either 1) absolutely incompetent, or 2) have an agenda to pursue. I'm hoping the CDC isn't quite that incompetent. 

&gt; What I regret is we didn't go forward and say, \u2018We do need research, but we need research with integrity.\u2019

He reasonably assumed that, forbidden from doing agenda-driven studies, the CDC would then start doing neutral, science-driven studies. Unfortunately, he didn't realize the extent of the anti-gun agenda at the CDC, which then decided to do no studies if they couldn't get the predetermined results they wanted. They couldn't risk producing a study that contradicts the gun control agenda. A proactive bill directing the CDC to perform neutral studies may have been a better idea. &gt;25-30 years ago public universities had lower tuition because they received much more tax funding

While tax funding is a part of it, they mainly had lower tuition because their costs were much more in check. Administration has grown much faster than the student body, meaning every tuition has to pay for more administrators than back then, and often at six-figure salaries. 

I could support free college under two circumstances. One, universities get their expenses in check. They need to trim administrative staff and unnecessary programs, and the government needs to strip some regulations that are the cause of some (not all) of those staff and programs. Two, we need to set criteria for getting this free education based on academic merit, nothing else. That bar needs to be set high enough so that our tax dollars aren't wasted on people who need to learn the number line we all learned in third grade (yes, I've seen it). We need to send only people who can really benefit from the higher level of education. They only counted defensive gun uses where the assailant died (a tiny minority of all defensive gun uses). Injuring or scaring away the would-be attacker, which is most cases, did not count as the gun "conferring protection." They used proxies to determine whether someone alive had a gun, didn't ask the people themselves, and those proxies may or may not have known the person had a gun, resulting in under reporting. Meanwhile, the people who had a gun and died were 100% counted since the police would have recovered their gun from the scene. 

It also counted if you had an old gun sitting in a drawer that was never used, and somebody came in and shot you. Your possession had nothing to do with your murder, yet it's counted towards a gun in the home making you more likely to be murdered. It was also done in high-crime areas, meaning some people could have gotten their guns because they were in danger already -- the gun was a reaction to danger, not the cause of it.

There's more wrong, but you get the idea.&gt;then hastily sold its stock shares for a $6 million loss ... Both stocks have rebounded dramatically in the nearly three years since

The moral of the story is that making emotional decisions in response to a shooting is a pretty stupid idea. Listen and learn Democrats.Even if you 100% agreed with what he did, we're still left with the fact that he broke the law. He signed papers saying he'd keep these secrets, and acknowledging the laws regarding these secrets and the punishment for disclosing them. &gt;Putting all these resources into investigating something that had no evidence backing it up was a waste to start with

That's my point. The recent state investigation into fetal tissue sales was not done at either of these facilities. It was a complete waste of money, except to provide PP with the sound bite of "We were cleared of any wrongdoing." The slippery slope of gun control is so solidly established that the continuation of that slope cannot be a logical fallacy. We are fighting against the continuation of this slope into confiscation. We've already had many calls for banning and confiscation of various categories of guns, so we know the intent exists. 

We already have a case where a medical diagnoses of slight depression (with it explicitly noted that there was no tendency for violence) has resulted in the police coming to the door and taking the guns. Not crazy, not suicidal, not homicidal like we've been told the criteria are, just mildly depressed like a lot of people get now and then. How did they know he had those guns? Registration. Now we keep lowering the requirement for confiscation so that it covers almost everybody. That's just one way they do it.I love such honesty, such as how people used to say "Howard Berman (D-Disney)" or "The representative from Hollywood" to reflect the fact of who owned him. The TPP started in 2005, the US joined in 2008.&gt;He is human who will grow old and die.

And it is this human that is subject to prosecution under the laws for his willful violation of them, regardless of any overall good that may be claimed. The law prevents a meth cooker from buying enough Sudafed by himself legally in order to make commercial quantities because he needs enough to continually churn out hundreds of doses. As for the numbers, it used to be a lot of pills using old cooking methods, but modern methods are much more efficient, maybe only a few pills to make a hit of meth. 

But the law doesn't work because the purchasing just went distributed. There's a whole underground economy of people who consistently buy within the legal limit and sell to the meth cookers for profit, and this includes a lot of meth heads (bring a box of Sudafed for a discount!). Meanwhile, the first bust for this law was a guy buying a bunch of Sudafed for his son to last through Summer Bible camp.  That was a fun conversation with the pharmacist while I was signing for some Sudafed.

I also learned that even pharmacists think the on-the-shelf pseudoephedrine replacement, phenylephrine, doesn't work. It's what you get in Sudafed PE. Just don't bother buying it in pill form.&gt;Ok, fine, do it, put him in jail for the rest of his natural life.. that's about him.

That's what we're talking about.

&gt;What about the revelations he told us about that affect us?

There's already been quite the uproar over that. &gt;You did not answer my question

I don't have to answer your question. We are trying to head off mass confiscation. Get that concept of a timeline? Heading it off means it hasn't happened -- yet. Once they think they can confiscate without violent repercussions, it'll be too late to stop it. All we need is yet another ban like we've had in the past, but without a grandfather clause, and it's confiscation.

San Francisco tried to ban handguns from the city with Proposition H, and it included no grandfather clause for existing owners, or even a buyback. It was turn them in, get rid of them, or get arrested. That's confiscation. SF is at the forefront of progressive thought on this issue. It's where the ant-gun people wish the whole country was. Fortunately, the court struck it down. &gt;I hope someone comes up with a better idea 

They have. Better enforcement. Out of over 70,000 people who are denied the purchase of a firearm every year, many are incorrectly denied. That still leaves tens of thousands who were denied for a valid reason, and at least several thousand who knew they were prohibited. Yet they still sign that 4473 saying under penalty of perjury that they are not prohibited. Do you know how many we eventually prosecute? Under 100.

These are bad guys who actively sought out guns. We have their names. We have prima facie evidence of their crime of perjury. The administration simply chooses not to prosecute.You're talking academic merit relative to the subject, which is fine. The important thing is ridding us of the idea that everybody gets to go to college. No, some people simply have no business being in college, and we shouldn't waste tax dollars on that.It is. Why come up with more laws if we haven't even tried vigorous and targeted enforcement of our current ones? Do you think your new law will magically be enforced against the criminal class, when the current ones aren't?

They have a huge gun violence problem in DC, lots of criminals running around with guns to keep police and prosecutors very busy. They also have the gun laws like you'd like to have nationally. You know who they decide to spend resources on? A guy who went shooting in Virginia, but accidentally left a dud shotgun shell in his pocket upon his return to DC. Yep, that's a crime, and they considered it worthwhile to prosecute this case instead of going after actual violent criminals. There are so many cases of innocent lives ruined by laws like you want because we the otherwise law-abiding make a sweet target for police and prosecutors.&gt;you honestly think all we need to do is enforce our current laws

That's probably 90% of it.

&gt;How do we create the massive change in attitudes and priorities among police in order to accomplish this?

Don't know, but that doesn't require a gun law. I guess it would take a leader who doesn't just say "We need an 'assault weapon' ban" and actually wants to tackle the causes of violence.

&gt;What current laws are not being enforced? 

Not necessarily always not enforced, but enforced in a way that doesn't stop gun crimes.

Another example, the ATF once spent years going after one gun store for what in the end amounted to paperwork mistakes. Not one straw sale (selling to someone who is buying for a criminal) was even alleged. Their attempt to shut down the store was eventually thrown out in court with the judge noting the store's paperwork was more accurate than the ATF's. Meanwhile there was another store that was known by everybody to court straw buyers, willing to look the other way while thousands of guns went to criminals, and the ATF didn't even bother to inspect for over a decade.

We need to have a value judgment in prosecution "Are we going after the real criminal type here?" But we don't. When it comes to gun laws, it seems that nothing pleases a prosecutor more than using them against regular people who had no intent to commit crimes. This is one reason we are very afraid of any more gun laws -- we know how they will be enforced. The people passing the laws know this too, which is why we view such laws as knowingly suppressing lawful gun ownership, not targeting gun violence.

&gt;You mentioned D.C. specifically.

DC already has the laws you want, "assault weapon" ban, purchase permit, universal background check, registration, "high-capacity magazine" ban. It's still a violent cesspit. It's a shining example of how these laws simply won't help, and instead burden regular people.&gt;Why do you think that some people don't deserve to be educated? 

Educated through high school, yes. But advanced education requires the advanced intellect to be able to have it be worth anything. Never attempt to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time and annoys the pig.I always figured that the core result of get-out-the-vote is to get more input into our political process from people who don't even care about our country enough to vote on their own accord, and are likely not well informed about the issues and candidates. This dilutes the vote of those who actually do care to vote, and learn about those issues and candidates to make an informed vote.&gt;Eliminate the ability to filibuster the motion to proceed; in other words, don\u2019t allow filibusters on whether to move to debate a bill

The filibuster is the only tool a minority has to prevent the majority from riding roughshod. Our problems can be solved with a two-pronged approach:

One, eliminate the dual-track system the Democrats introduced in the 1970s, which quickly caused a surge in filibusters. Before this, a filibuster halted all other debate in the Senate. Only that bill could be considered, and nothing else. This made a filibuster very politically expensive. Most of your own party had to be willing to stop all of their own bills so you could stop this one, so you needed a hell of a lot of support.  This will reduce the number of filibusters.

Two, require an actual filibuster. Right now any one senator can put a hold on a bill and continue on with his week. That's the filibuster. Nope, make him stand up and speak for the entire time he wants to filibuster. This increases the effort required to filibuster, and will thus reduce the length of filibusters. It's a rational fear backed by a consistent established slippery slope and many statements of intent. If you live in Texas, you know the Republicans are trying to effectively ban abortion, although they haven't done it. That doesn't make your fear any less real, your fight against them any less important.So how is this sexist display supposed to address female concealed carriers?Maybe check out how Leonard Peltier is doing too.Yes they can, they just have to call you Uncle Tom. But they still haven't figured out what to do with Colion Noir. $38,000 a year is just getting by in Virginia?&gt;Correlation is not causation. 

No, but correlation is required for causation, and the correlation is more guns = less violence. This means more guns do not correlate to more violence, which hurts the causal claim for that. 

&gt;In addition, the article's statement talks about the murder rate but does not discuss the gun violence/murder rate and these things may be different-

Whether by a bullet or a blade, you're just as dead. It is best to focus on the overall murder rate, because following a gun ban the knife murder rate may go up to fill in the gap, which means we didn't save any lives.&gt;They had no funding for any kind of gun study.

They still could use their money. Obama ordered them to do one, and they did. It didn't come out very anti-gun, which is why they don't publicize it. &gt;No one has suggested that everyone just gets to go to college for free

Yes they have. Whenever I hear the "everyone should go to college" thing along with the "free tuition" thing, I never hear a caveat for qualifications. 

&gt;You still have to apply and get in just like you do today. 

Yet colleges still admit people who don't understand the number line. That's fine for me if they want to blow their own money or saddle themselves with debt, but if the taxpayers are paying, it should only be for college-ready students. And I mean real college ready, we shouldn't pay for them to take remedial classes that are a repeat of what we already paid for them to learn in high school.I said nothing about mandatory, quite the opposite. If they want to go, but don't have the qualifications, they don't get to go.How we always decide academic ability. 

I'm not going to feel sorry for the guy who can't test well enough to fulfill his dream of college any more than you should feel sorry for me for not being a track star because I can't run fast enough. It's just how it played out. &gt;He doesn't live well, but he can support himself, his girl, and his 2 year old kid.

And this chart is for a single person.&gt; You don't want visiting admin to discuss enrollment to be like a trip to the DMV, where you wait in ridiculous lines

It's not that low-level administrative staff that's a problem. The number of these people should grow in proportion to the student body to serve them well, as should teaching staff. The problem is that administration has grown far faster than the student body, almost double the rate, so that there are now more people in admin than teaching. 

Various positions are created with high salaries, each of whom needs a high-salary deputy and some staff. There's a lot of kingdom building and favors going on. These administrators could disappear for weeks and nobody would really notice. I saw one high-salary woman get a job as "special projects" because she was a friend of the president and needed a job, and she didn't really do anything except butt into business that was already being handled by the people whose job it was to do those things. Diversity programs are a part of the new budget, run by six-figure administrators with six-figure deputies and huge staffs. 

&gt;How do you decide who should not be allowed to pursue those opportunities? 

Whether you are academically gifted enough to handle college-level education. If you barely made it through high school, you probably don't belong in college. If you need a remedial math course because you can't grasp 7th grade math, you don't belong in college.

&gt;Am I doomed to living paycheck to paycheck because I don't have the right scores?

Maybe. I suggest a non-college related career, maybe some vocational training, because if you go to college, you're just wasting everybody's time and money. &gt;According to this article that's incorrect.

Okay, technically True in a theoretical sense, but I don't see how it can apply to this real-world scenario.

&gt;That's why it's important that correlation is not causation: because making such connections is so often wrong.

I am also not sure of the claim "more guns equals less violence." Since both sides seem so wrong, it's more likely True that guns have noting to do with the violence rate either way. 

&gt;If we want to talk about gun violence and gun deaths, then talking about deaths that are not connected to said weapons doesn't make sense

The error is in trying to restrict the issue to only gun violence and gun deaths in the first place. We have a problem with people dying due to the violence of others. This needs to be addressed. Focusing on method distracts us from the actual causes of the violence, leading us away from real solutions. &gt;so you have any solutions?

The problem is he's right. The real problem is that his policies probably wouldn't do much to address the problem. I've heard some stuff from him about helping with day care, and he wants welfare structure to stop encouraging absentee dads, but it's nowhere near enough. 

&gt;but don't just blame the kid or the single parent, they're just doing what they can with the cards they were dealt

Can't blame the kid, but can blame the single parent in most cases. Not having kids until you're in a stable relationship would drastically reduce the number of single-parent families. This isn't cards dealt to them, it's the cards they chose, face-up.This isn't about the regular relationship. These are private in-home caregivers, hired by their individual clients, but Medicaid pays for the service. The terms of their employment are in state law, and as negotiated between them and their clients. These caregivers are not employees of the state, and receive no benefits, retirement, etc., as state employees.

There's no classic employer-employee relationship for a union to help here. However, the unions got the state in Illinois to classify caregivers as being included in the state's union. As such, the union automatically started getting a cut of the money they were being given to care for these people without even having to provide one service to the caregivers. 

Given this situation, it's quite obvious why people would immediately drop their union membership when allowed.Then wages there may need to be higher, but go to someplace like Lynchburg and that's quite a bit higher than the median income. File down that callous, grab a shovel handle and rub, rub, rub. I think I would have just disappeared to the Outback.There were interesting cultural differences. I was reading on the original settlers of what is now West Virginia. They would meet natives peacefully, come to an agreement to buy land from them, exchange the valuable goods for the land, and then start to farm (generally themselves, slaves weren't much used around there). The natives would come back next year demanding payment, and this sometimes led to violence, and much hatred of the natives by the settlers. The natives couldn't or wouldn't understand the concept of a permanent transfer of property. This lack of the ability to understand basic Western concepts helped create the view that they were savages of lesser intelligence. Intellectuals tend to like the Marxist movements, they think it will result in the perfect society *this time* despite a long history of failure. Thinking like this is why we have a reasonably short time limit for patents, and used to have a reasonable one for copyright.Clerks vs Clerks II.And those amounts are far above the minimum for most locales. &gt;. so your solution is for people to just stop having sex? you do realize how unrealistic that is

It's still their choice, so whatever happens, it's on them. Of course the Republican fight against birth control doesn't help things much here. Also, being poor is often associated with having a criminal history, because that limits job options. How about not committing the crime? But then we come back to the Democrat/Republican War on Drugs, which tends to create a lot of criminals. 

Changes in the laws and our programs could do a lot to help people, but in the end it's their own decisions that have the most impact on them and their children. &gt;I'm appalled that you would blame my mother for the fact that my father walked out on us. 

I did say most cases, not all. &gt;Unless you're in the boonies out near TN or NC, cost-of-living is insanely high in the extended DC-Metro area

Otherwise stated, unless you live in a couple specific high-priced areas, their target income is far more than just getting by.Just because this area exists in Virginia is no valid reason for people in the rest of the state to have a minimum income of what is currently far above the median. This is why a national $15 minimum wage doesn't work, why even a high state minimum wage won't necessarily work. Cost of living is highly dependent on the area within a state that a person lives. If everyone in CA were paid according to SF economics, the people up North would be rich, but then there's no way the businesses up North would be able to pay that kind of wage.A wealthy person can afford a Tesla, thereby eliminating his carbon payments based on gasoline. A poor person is stuck with his gas guzzler. Both will get the same "dividend." You just took money from the poor guy and gave it to the rich one. Scares the [black gun nuts](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrColionNoir) too. I guess in your mind the female shooters have a breast size complex?&gt;The numbers are based on the average living wage

I just saw an interesting fact. If Bill Gates walks into a stadium, the average net worth of people in that stadium is over a million dollars. Crazy high numbers skew averages.

&gt;which is clearly much higher than it would be living in southwest VA.

The problem comes when they say everyone should get that higher wage because, according to them, close to $40K a year is necessary to live *anywhere* in VA.The claim here is that almost $40K is a necessary income in VA.You chose it. Liberal means many things. A classical liberal in economics is more akin to a modern libertarian. When it comes to individual rights, liberal means to open up, make more lax, leave more to the individual. So we have liberalization of marriage policy, liberalization of drug policy, liberalization of family planning policy, liberalization of gun polic... Nope, wait, even though it is actually liberalization, the standard US liberal program is absolutely against a liberal gun policy. So they are more following a dictated political platform than a consistent ideology. However, we have many liberals who actually stick to liberal ideology regardless of the national platform, and want liberal policy even when pertaining to guns. I can appreciate these people, even when we disagree.That racist hit piece isn't very flattering for your side. Colion Noir was popular Youtuber for two years, hitting over 80,000 subscribers, before the NRA noticed him. The NRA was actually pretty behind on this one.&gt;I have every expectation the lobbys that represent gun manufacturers 

Most of the money spent promoting gun rights is spent by gun rights organizations that represent millions of people overall. The actual civilian firearms manufacturer lobby is a minority. They mainly lobby to get government contracts.

But then, can you blame any lobbying they do? Here you have companies that produce perfectly legal products, and there's a massive lobby out there trying to run them out of business. They'd be idiots not to fight back. 

&gt;The CDC is not given a check to disseminate as they see fit. That is why this method to defund the study was used.

Yet somehow they were able to do a study when ordered to by Obama.

&gt;I have every expectation the lobbys that represent gun manufacturers will do everything possible to discredit any and every results that goes against guns regardless of the validity of the underlying data.

It would be interesting to see. But then first we need a decent study that goes against guns, not the hit pieces that Bloomberg has been funding absent the CDC funding. Oh yes, agenda-driven anti-gun research has continued quite happily despite the CDC ban. &gt;Anyone else remember in kindergarten when you had a cop come in and show you videos about gun safety 

They don't do that anymore. Can't show the kids guns, they might end up wanting to get into shooting sports. I had a gun safety class as late as middle school, and it included handling deactivated BB guns for practice, and it was mandatory. Accidentally pointing that barrel at a classmate hurt your grade.

&gt;If you own a gun and you have children secure the fucking firearm and teach them gun safety. 

This is why I don't have much sympathy for grandma. In the end, it's her fault she's in this situation as much as a drunk is at fault for drifting off the road and  running into a tree. Their gross negligence is the cause. 

My mom kept a pistol on the kitchen counter. Not that I'd do that with my kids (locked up), but I did know about gun safety and never touched it except to take it out to practice -- with permission, of course. You have to know your kids, something that is apparently beyond the grasp of many parents these days.&gt;Apparently it's wrong to be afraid of guns (according to Reddit) but I am.

It's not healthy to be afraid of inanimate objects. 

&gt; I'm afraid of all things that were made to kill. 

Knives? Flyswatters? Arrows? Ropes, that when knotted can be used for hanging? Pointy sticks? An early purpose of the axe was as a war weapon.

&gt; I can safely say that I am afraid of guns and truly have no desire to own it shoot one.

You should work on that hoplophobia, but not having a desire to own or shoot a gun is perfectly fine, it's just not your thing. As long as your fear doesn't lead you to restricting others, it's all good. Penn and Teller did this, although it wasn't their finest moment. To test the "violent video games create crazed shooters" myth, they found a kid who was very into these first-person shooter games. With mom's permission, they took him to an instructor who carefully showed him how to shoot an AR-15. However, the first time the kid shot it, he started crying. His games left him completely unprepared for what it was like to actually shoot a gun. He didn't want to take another shot.

No, it wasn't the recoil physically hurting him, the recoil on an AR is too light for that, not high-powered.&gt;A semi-auto with a heavy slide spring, kept with no cartridge chambered and the magazine just shy of all the way in

I had a girlfriend who couldn't rack a compact 9mm. I recently discovered that the reason they make the 9mm Sig P290RS in .380 is because they engineered the latter to have a very light slide pull so that weaker people can use it. My guns have caused fewer injuries than Ted Kennedy's car, or Laura Bush's. That required a dedicated long-term hack. The way this was set up, an amateur could have owned the server through little effort.I don't have to. It's only pure luck that nobody targeted her server, because it would have been owned in minutes had even an amateur hacker taken interest. The State Department was targeted in a highly sophisticated sustained attack where the hackers had to get through layers of security. Clinton apparently had little security in this amateur setup.A disproportionate number of those minority deaths are in big cities, most of which have been run by Democrats for decades and have stricter gun policies than nationally. Mentioning them is not convenient for a Democrat running on an anti-gun platform.Then you read the update admitting he was wrong.Two people I despise, this should be fun.There is no need to. The issue is how much danger her gross mismanagement put us in. Pointing a gun at an innocent isn't okay even if you don't pull the trigger.All indications are a plain Windows server connected directly to the Internet, managed directly over the Internet using RDP. McDonalds kept the coffee at the proper recommended temperature for best flavor, and that happens to be hot enough to burn, which is why you're supposed to be careful. 

You know, the tip of a soldering iron is supposed to be hot enough to burn under proper use. I think I'll set one down on my lap and sue the company if it falls over and burns my dick.No, it was at the proper temperature.You probably brew and keep your coffee at too low of a temperature, as many people do. Then you haven't spilled it all over your crotch while wearing fabric that absorbed the hot liquid and held it against your skin, insulating it from the cooler outside air.The law protecting the gun industry only protects them if they stay within the confines of the law. They knowingly aided a straw purchase, so no protection, and a righteous suit prevails. The law that the anti-gun people complain about because it stops their nuisance suits worked perfectly here.Nobody is going to come to their rescue.Not for long. &gt;But we can talk about the gun suicides if you'd like. Did you know that suicides account for 2/3 of all gun deaths every year?

Yes, and yet the anti-rights people use the suicide number to push for "assault weapon" and "high-capacity magazine" bans, which would have zero effect on suicides.

&gt;If you're done, we can look into the "relationship between victim and murderer" stat. Go ahead.

Did you know that "someone you know" includes rival gang members and drug dealers? 

&gt;If you eliminate deaths within the immediate family, hell, you're down in the "struck by lightning while cashing lottery ticket" odds.

If you eliminate gang-related violence, it goes way down too.RTFAThanks for the graphic picture warning. Coffee is supposed to be kept around 180 degrees, a temperature that is capable of making these wounds. Frying oil is supposed to be kept at a temperature even hotter than this, and can produce even worse burns. 

The takeaway here is that hot things are hot, so treat them with due care.&gt;having a large home causes more emissions, and on and on. 

A rich person can afford a high-efficiency home with lots of solar panels in order to cut his grid energy use to less than that of a poor person. A rich person can afford high-efficiency new cars. He can afford to buy the higher-priced locally-sourced produce. In the end, energy efficiency may cost the rich guy a lot more than the poor guy, but it'll be in buying stuff, not in paying a carbon tax that gets redistributed to the poor.

Unless you're Al Gore. He likes big gas-guzzling private jets.&gt;Which freedom is more valuable?

You are talking about a freedom from something that most likely will never affect you anyway, vs. a freedom immediately crushed through government force. The latter clearly wins. Your paranoia does not override the rights of others. If it did, we could crush pretty much any right under that concept.

&gt;Others would say that Australians are gifted with the freedom to barely worry a nutjob with a gun will shoot them. 

Your murder rate was already going down, and after the ban the murder rate kept going down on average. Your likelihood of getting shot may have gone down more, but your likelihood of getting killed was not affected by the gun ban. You aren't gifted with anything. Meanwhile in the US, our murder rate has continued to go down in correlation with record gun sales. 

&gt;Oh but then you are not free to avoid radiation from your neighbour using it. Which freedom is more important?" 

Not equivalent. Nobody opposes forbidding the use of a gun in a manner that constitutes an immediate threat to others. But simple ownership of a gun constitutes no more of an immediate threat than ownership of a car.

&gt;"How about we allow people the freedom to make as much noise as they want on their property? Ah, but that would impinge on their neighbours freedom to quietly enjoy their own property".

That creates an immediate infringement on their enjoyment of their property. But you'd ban stereo systems because a few people turn theirs up too loud.&gt;That's about 20 degrees hotter than what it should be and what other restaurants were serving.

[How to brew coffee](http://www.ncausa.org/About-Coffee/How-to-Brew-Coffee). Go down to "the temperature should be maintained at 180 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit." Other restaurants? Who cares? Because they do it wrong doesn't mean McDonald's should.&gt;But that kind of adaptation wouldn't be unique to the rich

Yes it is. The poor simply can't afford to take measures to lower energy use like the rich can. Even a rich company owner can afford to produce things more efficiently, avoiding the carbon tax. 

&gt;but the factory that makes products they buy

Which gets really funny when you think of the factories that make solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines.&gt;The fact that they had over 700 complaints

700 people in 10 years. McDonald's sold about 10 billion cups of coffee in that time. That's 0.00000007 complaints per cup sold. An extremely tiny percentage of customers, only the most careless and ignorant among them, complained that McDonald's keeps coffee at the proper temperature. 

&gt;scalded a women's labia, and uh..

She burned herself on something known to be hot, the damages were her fault. The extent of the damages are meaningless for McDonald's, except for people who decide on emotion instead of the facts.

&gt;Don't do it anymore

Quit storing coffee at the proper temperature? That's a strange demand.&gt; A cogent argument can be made that specific types of weapons and accessories infringe or restrict those other rights.

It can't infringe on another's right unless it's actually used by another person to infringe on another's right. When it comes to rights, the balance isn't based on general feel-goods and statistics. A Christian can stand on the corner and talk about how we need to round up all the gays and put them in extermination camps, but we can't stop him unless his speech incites imminent lawless action. 

&gt; If they want to be safe they'd be better off on something that will make a much bigger statistical dent - anti-slip mats in tubs, getting rid of carpeted stairways, or, for a real knockout - wearing a seatbelt.

Why wear seat belts when you can carpet the stairway? Why have an anti-slip mat when you can wear a seat belt? Or how about all these things add up in your general safety, so do them all.  I've been in an accident where my seat belt helped exactly once. And if the leaking gas in the overturned car had caught on fire it would have killed me because the buckle was stuck.

&gt;People should be allowed to make bad decisions, though, it's the most basic of freedoms.

Like buying a $1,500 AR-15 because the gun-grabbers started talking about another ban. &gt;that means the people buying those products won't be hurt by the tax either.

That means the company can increase profits due to avoidance of the tax. They don't have to pass down the savings. The poor get stuck again. 

&gt;Is this a serious comment? 

Those do produce a lot of carbon in their creation. The fact check is wrong on Sanders and the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The law was designed to stop a plague of nuisance suits intended to harm the industry in general. True, this protection is rare, but then people trying to sue an industry out of existence is rare too, prompting the law. The article omits the reason for the law.

&gt;The law allows victims to sue if there was a design defect or a malfunction with a gun, but there have been exceptions.

No, there have not been exceptions. The article tries to make it look like a blocked lawsuit was over a defective gun, but it wasn't. If a gun functions as intended, as designed, then it is not defective, and the manufacturer can't be sued. Differences of opinion as to what features or warnings a gun should have do not count as defects. They can be sued for actual defects, say the dropped gun fires despite having a drop safety. There have been recalls over exactly this, and the law would have allowed a suit had anyone been hurt and sued.

But specifically to Sanders' point, a gun store is immune to a lawsuit for conducting business in a legal manner. The recent story about the successful lawsuit against Bud's gun shop shows us how the law does not block lawsuits if the dealer did something illegal, such as allowing an obvious straw sale.

I rate this fact check mostly False.Smoking and drinking age should be 18. If you're old enough to fight and die for your country, you're old enough to smoke and drink. &gt;He has nothing to support his assumption that all murderers are already convicted criminals when they are arrested for taking a life.

Most [murderers](http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcgvmurd.html) are of the criminal class and have a history of violence. The really interesting fact is that in the big cities where murders disproportionately occur, the majority of *victims* have prior criminal records, showing how much of our violence is criminal-on-criminal. The regular guy who just goes off and kills someone is not the standard case.&gt;How are the companies better off than without the tax?

The tax is supposed to get redistributed to the poor, remember? No tax revenue, no redistribution. This idea also harmfully targets specific industries. Have a billion-dollar finance company that employs a small staff highly-paid people? Little to no carbon tax. Have a billion-dollar energy-intensive manufacturing company that provides jobs for thousands of regular workers? High carbon tax. You've just screwed the regular workers again.

There is no way the carbon tax isn't regressive. It always favors the rich. &gt;When you're serving coffee through a window into a person's car, it should be consumable. Period. People intend on drinking it immediately.

When I was young I used to go with construction crews to help out. They bought their coffee and drove to the construction site where they'd drink it. They had an expectation of very hot coffee so that it would still be hot by the time they got to their destination. For the office coffee buys of my later life, people bought coffee and brought it to the office to drink. People in the office expected it to be hot 20 minutes after purchase. If it's stored at **below optimum** temperature, it will be lukewarm by the time many people drink it. 

&gt;Coffee at a normal temperature wouldn't cause the type of damage that it did

The coffee was stored at normal temperature, which is 180-185 degrees Fahrenheit. This normal temperature, recommended by the coffee experts to encourage better-tasting coffee, will cause damage like that. 

Technically, we could cook our fries in 160 degree oil and stop thousands of oil burns every year, but we're left with the plain fact that fries are best cooked at temperatures that cause serious burns. I've burned myself badly on my cast iron skillet. I didn't blame myself for having the pan very hot, which it was supposed to be in order to sear meat, but for my carelessness in touching it without protection.

In fact, there was recently the case of a guy who sued a restaurant for getting burned on the hot cast iron fajita pan that was served to him. It was rightly thrown out because -- who woulda thunkit -- hot things are hot! &gt;Hey, I drive a sports car with thousands of dollars worth of upgrades in it 

We need to ban your car because some people use it for dangerous illegal street racing. There is no embarrassment necessary. Everybody, even the smartest among us, was ignorant on any one subject at one point in their lives. This is especially True on a subject where the average person regularly receives a barrage of ignorance-promoting propaganda. 

However, ignorance in a smart person is easily cured by education. The especially smart person will realize there's something wrong with the propaganda and seek out the education himself. You only need to be embarrassed if, faced with the education, you retreated back into the ignorance-based position. 

Ignorance is normal and curable. Stupid is embarrassing and forever. Despite other disagreements with his views, Sanders was going to get my vote until he started with the standard "assault weapon" crap.&gt;You don't need an increase to your second ammendment right

Correct. We need a decrease of the infringements on that right.

&gt;The right to bear arms has had limits imposed on it before

Historically in order to disarm blacks, but that's okay, right?

&gt;our rights are not without limits as deemed appropriate and reasonable.

In our general framework of rights, your rights stop at the point where you create otherwise lawless action or you present an immediate and real threat to others. Simple possession of an AR-15 does neither of these. 

&gt; so what is the problem with background checks and licensed to own a gun? 

There are two main problems with enforced background checks. One, the people who already commit the crime of knowingly selling to criminals won't bother to get the background check done before the sale. They're already committing a felony, so an added charge of failing to do the check isn't much of a deterrent. Two, background check laws can easily entrap people who meant to do nothing illegal. Right now in Washington it's technically illegal to hand your gun to your friend while shooting on your property. This generates a fear about owning a gun, tending to create a chilling effect on ownership. Chilling effect is not allowed for free speech, shouldn't be allowed for guns. 

By licensing, you probably mean the whole thing: you get a license, you use it to buy a gun, that gun is now registered to you. Did you know that the only people who can't be forced to register, cannot be punished for failing to register, are the criminals? It would be a 5th Amendment violation. 

Rand Paul at least is warning against the "off with his head" attitude. We give asylum for the violation of laws in other countries that we find unconscionable. For laws like this that we ourselves have, we'd extradite. Only the rich have the financial means to avoid a carbon-based tax. The poor don't. As the rich do more and more to avoid the tax, an entire fleet of zero-emission $100,000 Teslas and solar everywhere, less and less money becomes available to redistribute to those people who are stuck driving old gas guzzlers and living in leaky houses with no solar.

If I had a few hundred thousand dollars I could cut my emissions to almost zero, completely eliminating carbon use for my regular transportation, lights, cooking, refrigeration, heating and cooling. But since I'm not rich I'm going to be paying a high tax to haul my family around, and keep them warm and fed. Don't worry, I'll get a dividend! You mean the one that was supposed to be paid by the rich guy who cut all his emissions? He's getting the dividend! I'm paying for him!Interesting. Your point?&gt;I don't think the Supreme Court is likely to uphold such legislation post-DC v Heller.

It depends on if Sanders gets to appoint a far-left justice.&gt;I'm required to register the car, pay a tax for use of it

You are only required to register the car and pay the tax if you want to drive it on public roads. Possession is unrestricted.

&gt; obtain a lot of liability insurance in case someone is hurt by it 

Almost all gun violence in the country is due to crime. Insurance does not pay out in the case of a crime. Insurance for gun ownership would place a burden with almost no likelihood of being covered. 

&gt;and it is inspected yearly and will be ordered off the road if it does not meet numerous standards for safety and environmental compliance

Again, only counts for a car you drive on the public roads. I could buy a car with no title transfer and drive it around, as long as I don't want to go on the public roads. I was driving a truck at 15 with no license, but it was an old unregistered truck on the private land where I worked. It didn't have doors, turn signals, and other things that would have kept it off the public roads. 

&gt;By operating my car, I waive certain civil liberties (such as for DWI) for the interest of public safety

In most cases, a license to carry a concealed weapon is effectively invalid while the carrier is intoxicated. Where laws are most strict, if a cop notices a license holder carrying concealed, and sees him take one sip of beer, he can be arrested and charged with a criminal offense. Can you get a DWI for one sip of a beer?

&gt;The police have the right to detain me on the spot for any suspected improper use of my car.

Same for guns. Nobody argues against the prohibition of specific improper and dangerous acts with guns. You can't run down the street pointing a gun at people and shooting into the air. Nobody will argue this should be legal. But the gun prohibitionists suggest no laws of this sort. They want to ban mere possession.

But please, let's go with the car/gun analogy!

* People can buy a gun at any age, use it on public property at 16
* No background check to buy a gun, criminals can get them
* Your license to use it on public roads can be revoked due to your own actions, but not the ownership of your gun, you keep that
* Public use licenses are revoked for gun-related offenses. Other convictions do not impact your public use gun license
* No license or registration required for possession of a gun, or for use on private property
* Transport a gun anywhere on public property without license or registration, only use on public property is governed
* Gun dealers everywhere in every city
* No $200 tax needed to install [hearing protection](http://www.mississippiautoarms.com/images/Silencerco-Osprey-02.jpg)
* 100% national reciprocity on licenses for the use of guns on public property, not restricted in any jurisdiction
* The power and type of gun is not restricted even on public roads. 
* Some safety standards may be required, but they will be accepted in the market on the merits years before any mandate, and everything will be grandfathered
* Nobody brings lawsuits against car manufacturers for the illegal use of their cars

If you take the gun/car analogy all the way, I might just agree on it. Except the violent felons and guns thing of course. &gt;There just isn't any reason to expect the rich would reduce their emissions

If it's cheaper than the tax they will, and that's what you wanted, isn't it? Reduced emissions? Any emissions tax that's enough to convince the rich to cut their emissions will be a burden on the poor. I'm absolutely serious. These are the facts. The coffee was at the recommended temperature, that's a fact. People who think it was too hot simply have an incorrect view of what the proper temperature is, as much as someone who thinks 400-degree oil is too hot for frying because it can cause burns. &gt;I didn't realize it was being infringed upon right now.

There are many laws and regulations currently infringing on the right.

&gt; I'm talking about assault rifle bans and limits on other personal munitions.

You mean the semi-automatic rifles that have scary black plastic furniture on them, but are otherwise no more lethal than their other semi-automatic counterparts with classic wood furniture? Or do you mean real assault rifles, the selective fire ones the military uses? The latter are not generally available for purchase at your local gun store.

&gt;You can't own a grenade now can you or an RPG or many other things of military nature. 

Actually you can, it just gets rather expensive with the licensing. 

&gt;But who the fuck needs an AR 15? 

First, the concept of "need" comes nowhere near rights. You exercise a right because you *want to*. If you have to show a need, then it is no longer a right. I don't *need* to tell the officer I don't consent to a warrantless search of my house, but I sure as hell *want* to exercise my right to be free from such searches. Do you think I should be required to let the police search my house without a warrant because my exercise is only a *want*?

&gt;Why do you worship that fucking thing so much? 

I personally don't like AR-15s. I don't ever plan on owning one. However, the platform is an exceptional one. It's easily shootable by almost anyone, especially people with less strength. It's infinitely customizable for the individual shooter, which makes it popular for the disabled too (why do you hate the disabled?). For target shooting it can be made extremely accurate, which is further enhanced by the fact that the bullet it was made for was made from one originally designed for target and varmint shooting. It's so low-powered that it's not even allowed for use in hunting deer in many states.

&gt;I swear most guys see an AR 15 as an extension of their penis amass just as important.

I've always wondered, do you people who make these sexist remarks also think that the women who like shooting such rifles are making up for small breasts? There are so many things wrong with your thought process from a liberal point of view. 

&gt;No one needs an assault rifle. The name assault implies bad context. 

That's fine, because what you can buy in the store isn't an assault rifle.

&gt;To steal from Jim Jeffries they don't call them defense rifles now do they? 

One of the biggest-name manufacturers is Daniel Defense. Self defense experts to praise these guns for their defensive utility. If the government would lift the restrictions on short-barreled versions, they would have even more defensive utility for the average buyer. As for murders, they are used in something less than one percent of murders, and no suicides. Why do you target a class of gun used to kill fewer people than are killed by bare hands?

&gt;You don't hunt with assault rifles. 

The AR-15 is very popular in varmint hunting, with its varmint hunting lineage. Its accuracy, low recoil, and allowance for quick follow-up shots are highly regarded. When you're shooting prairie dogs at 400+ yards, it's invaluable. People also like them in .300 caliber for shorter-range hunting of hogs and deer.  

&gt;Get some fucking common sense. 

Get some fucking knowledge of the facts. You have been factually deficient all the way up to this point. 

&gt;The argument that criminals won't register is stupid.

Actually, they are the only ones who cannot be legally required to register. It's a constitutional issue, the right to not self-incriminate. A criminal caught with a gun can be charged for the illegal possession, but not failure to register. Only a regular person can be charged for failure to register. So how is registering supposed to help fight crime?

As far as the rest of us, we might not be so fearful of registration if you didn't couple it with calls for various bans, as you do above. A ban needs registration for enforcement, so as long as the specter of a ban looms, we will oppose registration. You really hurt your own cause by pushing for bans. 

&gt;Licensing and background checks work in other places than the United States and are backed up by stats.

We have licensing and registration in Chicago and DC, and gun crime is rampant in those locations. 

&gt; Your reaching a fair bit too far with your assertions that the USA will crumble if guns are just slightly more controlled than they are now.

I don't make that assertion. I simply recognize the violation of rights.

&gt;No founding fathers had any idea of the culture of gun worship society has now nor the lobbying power of the gun industry

The Founding Fathers loved their guns, and they had no concept of a gun lobby because there was no need for one. There was no push for rights infringements that the gun lobby and civil rights organizations had a need to push back against. You want the pro-gun lobbying to disappear? Stop trying to restrict them! When someone (the British) came to try to take their guns, they simply shot back. 

&gt; Guns aren't going to dissappear or be banned.. no one sane is really arguing for that

Many people have proposed this. Feinstein's last "assault weapon" bill originally didn't have a grandfather clause, which would have meant mass confiscation had it passed in original form. And for her bill, "assault weapon" had an extremely wide definition that would have covered even most pistols and many traditional rifles. 

&gt;you're more likely to commit suicide or attempt it with easy access to a gun

Yet somehow gun-free Japan and Korea keep up those amazingly high suicide rates. 

&gt; children and adults are more likely to be the victim of accidental shooting worth a gun in the house

They're also more likely to be the victim of a car accident if they ride in cars. 
&gt;If you take ownership of one but do not transfer the title properly, it's quite possible you will have difficulty registering the car ever again

That's the point, you never intend to take it on the open road. You can get new titles for cars, but you may have to jump through some hoops that are purely designed to ensure no fraud is occurring. 

&gt;Two thirds of all gun deaths are self-inflicted. While technically a crime, prosecutions are rare for the sadly obvious reason

Gun insurance wouldn't pay out, only life insurance.

&gt;Second, casualty insurance won't pay out in a crime, but liability insurance is usually still in force.

Insurance companies generally don't like to pay for that. The victim has to sue the driver. It's automobile *accident* insurance, and an act committed in the commission of a crime is not considered an accident. There is no way an insurance company would pay out to the victim of a murder on a gun policy. I guarantee any policy would explicitly exclude any criminal act, and probably even negligence, leaving the owners of 360 million guns paying on policies that will be very rarely paid out. Pretty much only getting hit by a ricochet at a range or a hunting accident would be paid. 

&gt;Leave a gun where it can get stolen and fail to report it?

How far are you taking that? A sawzall will get you into a standard UL-rated gun safe in a few minutes. And if it got stolen while you were on vacation? What if you just haven't shot in a while and didn't notice it was quietly stolen while you were out one night? There are a lot of pitfalls that could put reasonably careful people in jail.

&gt;If you deliberately pointed it at people, you might be in trouble. 

Various versions of menacing and brandishing appear in the laws of every state I've looked at. North Carolina even has a "going to the terror of the public" provision. If people are scared, and the state thinks they had good reason to be scared, you're in trouble.

&gt;I don't think there's really much that can be done about it, even the supremes seem to say "settled law" on it. 

State law differs. Again to North Carolina, their law requires a person who is concealed carrying to announce to any approaching officer that he is carrying with a license. Nobody has claimed that's unconstitutional, because it's a condition of the license. But as far as general open carry, if you are doing absolutely nothing illegal, then why should an officer have the power to detain you? &gt;You embody everything wrong with society today. 

That's funny, because I think you do. You're marching in lock step with the Republicans who want to outlaw abortion and gay marriage, you just have a different target of your anti-rights hatred.

&gt;Your freedom is not dependant on guns being part of society. Your freedom is dependant on your ability to control your government from overreach

Those two are intimately related. Armed rebellion in an effort to control government from overreach is how this country was started.

&gt; and free from control by corporate interests. Ie. Keeping government working for the people. 

That's important too, but it has no relation to the issue of gun rights. 

&gt;That you define yourselves so proudly with guns said a lot about the type of society you value. 

One in which people are free in their pursuit of happiness? I'm such a bad boy. If guns make someone happy, he should be free to pursue them, up to the point where he actually uses them to harm or directly threaten another.

&gt;Guns are not the problem

You got that right.The guy who drives the old gas guzzler to work every day doesn't have much of an option for a behavior change. The rich guy can just get a Tesla. The poor guy may have problems affording getting his house re-roofed and re-insulated, but the rich guy just gets it done and installs solar to boot. I can't believe you're serious about the validity of a suit over **normal-temperature** coffee.Of course. Now I can't tell if you're trolling or just incapable of understanding facts."Ted Cruz blames NARAL for blocking abortion control..."

Good people are keeping bad people from doing bad things. This is a good thing. &gt;These are phrases you would expect to hear in a war zone

I was in a war zone, never heard those phrases.This is extremely lazy reporting, or simply a hit job designed to scare. 

Before I start with the numbers, I'll allow "dealer" to be used loosely, as in a business that sells guns. This would include ATF license types 1 (dealers of guns), 2 (pawnbrokers of guns) and 9 (dealers of destructive devices, which can include some guns). 

Looking at the [list](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/listing-federal-firearms-licensees-ffls-2015), of 64,198 dealers (not 65,000), only 43,271 have business names associated. The other 20,927 are individuals who have a dealer license for whatever reason, to include being able to possess certain devices, do transfers for friends, or even to be able to have a gun they bought mailed directly to them. Also, looking at the list, some of those have more than one license type. They get listed once for each type, meaning there is duplication in this total.

Also, this just compares to individual brands. There are over 200,000 fast food restaurants in the country, over five times the number of actual gun dealers.[Wrong](http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/gun-control-myths-realities), "The 31 states that have 'shall issue' laws allowing private citizens to carry concealed weapons have, on average, a 24 percent lower violent crime rate, a 19 percent lower murder rate and a 39 percent lower robbery rate than states that forbid concealed weapons." This is from 2000, when not all states had shall issue, thus we can make a comparison between carry states and non-carry states. 

Remember, Vermont has had concealed carry without even a license needed for a long time, and they continue to have a very low rate of gun violence.Don't ever get on one of their lists. I notice you didn't include Washington DC, which has by far the highest murder rate in the country (double Louisiana), and also the most restrictive concealed carry laws. Think there might be a connection?

Of course, where there is a correlation, you have causation backwards. Where allowed, people get more permits in reaction to the level of crime. More crime = more permits, not more permits = more crime. Concealed carriers tend to be more law-abiding than even the police. 

Another interesting fact for you, the percentage increase in female permit holders has far outpaced that of male permit holders, and females commit less than 10% of gun murders. Sadly, the favorable thing to say about the NYT here is that it obviously has no editorial standard. That's a travesty right there, and it's the nice thing to say. 

Even less favorably, and probably more likely, is that the NYT has an editorial standard that describes which counting method to use where. The restrictive method will be used to get lower counts in countries with strict gun control, and the more inclusive method will be used for the US.[There](http://www.democrats.org/) [are](http://www.vpc.org/) [many](http://everytown.org/) [organizations](http://www.bradycampaign.org/) constituting this movement. Sort of. They fraudulently claimed copyright for years until someone finally called them on it in court. I'm waiting for the request for damages for False payment demands to be awarded. A lease is a lease. They refuse to acknowledge and renegotiate the lease, so it remains at the initially negotiated price. I see we also paid for water until 1964, until the Cubans cut us off.&gt;Its just a reality that evidence shows these two regularly increasing since they are fundamentally linked to each other.

Vermont: Concealed carry for the whole population without even a permit, second to last in gun crime. DC: No concealed carry for the general population, highest gun crime in the country. If there's a fundamental link, it goes to more carry causes less crime. Of course not. They've all backed down from that in public proclamations because it's not politically practical, especially after Heller. It still remains their goal though. It's like a Republican saying he just wants to tighten the rules on abortion to protect the health of women. Yeah, right. You'd have to be an idiot to believe that's all he wants. Even then, no. To me at least, an arsenal is a modern collection of guns designed to arm a large number of people to fight, and it should be mostly homogeneous. If you have 70 guns of various types and ages in your family of six, you just have a lot of guns (or a "few" if you're in Texas). If you have 40 AK-47s and 30 Sig P226s, you are building an arsenal. And if you have or have had an FFL, "arsenal" doesn't apply. Warner's books should be scoured, and fees returned to all of those who paid, with interest. Back beyond where individual books are kept, the government should announce that anybody who has a receipt for payment can claim his fees plus interest if he acts within the next year. After that, the government should estimate the amount of money fraudulently earned, and make Warner pay that to libraries across the country. And I'm talking cash. The last time record companies had to pay libraries due to their malfeasance, they paid it in the form of multiple copies of old worthless CDs charged at full new price.Wow, this is exactly what it's like to talk to an anti-gunner!

Me: I don't want to take away dog owners' rights. But we need to do something about Rottweilers.
You: So what do you propose?

Me: I just think that there should be some sort of training or restrictions on owning an attack dog.

You: Wait. What's an "attack dog?"

Me: You know what I mean. Like military dogs.

You: Huh? Rottweilers aren't military dogs. In fact "military dogs" isn't a thing. You mean like German Shepherds?

Me: Don't be ridiculous. Nobody's trying to take away your German Shepherds. But civilians shouldn't own fighting dogs.

You: I have no idea what dogs you're talking about now.

Me: You're being both picky and obtuse. You know I mean hounds.

You: What the fuck.

Me: OK, maybe not actually ::air quotes:: hounds ::air quotes::. Maybe I have the terminology wrong. I'm not obsessed with vicious dogs like you. But we can identify kinds of dogs that civilians just don't need to own.

You: Can we?Maybe we can also make our own stripper clip. Essentially make a magazine that holds 30 rounds on a stripper clip instead of by spring. It can't be inserted into the gun and used, so it's legal. Put a plunger at the top. Push this magazine against the stripper clip rail, and push down the plunger, loading 30 rounds almost as fast as a magazine change. Slight metal additions to the rifle's receiver to secure the magazine while loading could make this even easier one-handed. 

Alternately, put a button at the bottom of the magazine that allows the spring and base plate to fall free. After that, I'm thinking some sort of magazine holding a spring/follower/bullet combo that can be put up to the now open magazine and plunged in until the new baseplate clicks in. 

Edit: Better explanation for the latter: Not reloading the rifle with a new magazine, instead instant in-place magazine reloading.&gt;Maybe because it's not a state?

DC has a higher population than two actual states, and isn't far behind a couple others. DC's population gets counted towards total US population, and DC's murders get counted towards the national total.  Its exclusion is disingenuous, an effort to eliminate a very uncomfortable fact for anti-gunners. Ha, "You just want a military assault hound that can do 20 meows in  half a second because you have small balls." Other points were covered, but:

&gt;Or they take what is historically weak Hadith (Hadith that Muslim scholars believed were suspect and not the words of the prophet

Sahih al-Bukhari is full of terror, and it's the most trusted of Hadith. It's not like Muslims need to rely on da'if Hadith to justify violence and intolerance. 

&gt;This type of thing has been done basically since the moment the prophet died, and rulers have alwayss tried to twist Islam to fit their agenda. 

True, happens with any religion. But in the end a religion is what it is right now. It is represented by those who practice it. And Islam isn't looking very peaceful or tolerant in general. &gt;Christians eventually got around this and simply started ignoring parts of the bible, I don't know if Muslims will be able to though.

These days we can look at a passage in the Bible, such as condoning slavery, and say that's not really applicable to today's society. We can criticize it as wrong. There aren't many hard-core absolute literalists left to tell us every single word is factual and valid today. Even the Catholic Church doesn't do this. 

The problem with current Islam is that to most the Quran is the True word of Allah through his messenger, every single word. Criticism of any part of it is considered an attack on Islam. Criticism of any act or saying of Mohammed in Hadith is also considered an attack on him. It is blasphemy, and can be considered apostasy (as in they kill you for it). Seriously, it's the middle ages for most of that religion. &gt;Molon Labrador

Thanks for the literal LOL!That's a turned around title. In general, it wouldn't benefit anybody to be put in a school that's too advanced for them. Normally this problem is resolved by only taking the most academically qualified students. If someone gets into a school via non-academic criteria despite his academic abilities not being up to par for that school, then we have that problem again. 

The non-academic criteria could be anything, like legacy students or daddy donated a library. In this case, it's black students since the case is about racial preferences. That doesn't make the concept Scalia is talking about any less valid. Every title on this that I've seen so far is lying about what Scalia said. I think in this case you would end up with more kids voting according to the political leanings of the teacher. Teachers are more often liberal, so we get more liberal votes. This was probably calculated before the proposal. Good point. I can understand the sentiment, but I'm still so glad for the 1st Amendment here. We need to ban assault swords. Now that's the first valid criticism I've seen. Yes, it's now public domain. Actually, it's been in the public domain for a long time, people were just too scared of Warner to push the issue. &gt;. Their faith has little to do with the fact they're murderous bastards 

Their faith is the root of their murder. Every thing they do, they believe they are doing it for the glory of Allah. This is about affirmative action. He isn't talking about blacks who get in on academic merit alone. Do we get to choose what kind? I've always been partial to Sean Connery's sword in Highlander. Okay, we finally get one where the title isn't lying about what Scalia said. Yes, those students who academically do not belong there, yet are there anyway, shouldn't be there. This case is about students who don't belong there, yet were placed there by affirmative action because they were black. It looks like they need to support the NRA, which has been working with states to tighten up their reporting into the background check system, to include disqualifying mental health events. 

However, we should be careful that simply seeking help doesn't disqualify people; otherwise, people won't get the help they need. Don't worry about the assholes, they won't matter at all once you graduate. Ten years later you'll look back and wonder why you gave a damn about what those idiots thought. Don't get too serious with a girl/boy, too much drama there, possibility of disease and pregnancy. Study, do your homework. Try to actually learn, not just regurgitate, if your school allows it. One True friend is worth more than the 20 people you could hang with. Few actually have your back. 

Most of all, make sure to have fun. It's still your childhood. Get as much distance as I can from the guy trying to kill me through bad driving and just laugh. If that doesn't work, scream. In extreme cases, pull over for a bit. Never actually do anything regarding the other driver, that's just stupid. Is the ouzo at the end ice cold? 

I practically lived on that stuff in Greece. Too bad. When is this anti-rights control freak going to finally be put out to pasture?You can say it Republicans, "Christian terrorism."This is just begging for some hood-based jokes.Manual impact screwdriver. When you whack it with a hammer, it turns the screw head slightly. Great for stuck screws, but can sheer off the head if the screw is completely stuck. But if it is, you're drilling anyway.When the early Lotus Elise came out, it had a regular four cylinder engine straight out of a Rover econobox car, low compression, moderate horsepower, designed to run on regular octane fuel. But no, people saw exotic sports car and surely it needed premium in order to run right. What a waste of money.Goddammit, it cost me $8.50 to take that idiot down!The one thing an attorney can do is customize the trust to your specific needs. If you feel your case is generic enough, other choices are probably good enough.Christians used to believe the Bible is the exact "word of God" like Muslims, but most have moved to "inspired by God."It has to be imminent. Rallying up your believers to run out and kill some infidels right now may be illegal, but generally speaking about how the infidels must face Allah's wrath isn't. They currently make their own firearms laws. In fact, they're in big trouble with the district court for keeping their laws unconstitutional. For courts they use the federal courts. They make gun policy, their gun murders count in the statistics the anti-gunners use, so you get to live with DC being a shining example of strict gun laws. &gt;The circumstances under which the 'lease' was contracted may have some bearing 

We helped the Cubans in their fight for independence from Spain, famously with the important Marine defeat of the Spanish garrison in Guantanamo Bay. After the war we reduced our military presence in Cuba, only keeping one small base on lease. Democrats are saying Sanders isn't a real Democrat because he doesn't support their extremist view against gun rights. He's been attacked on all sides for it, and it's forced him to move more towards their position. He was fairly acceptable to pro-rights people when he first started. I have never in my life registered for a party, and have voted for people of both parties, and indeed other parties. That's independent. If you're not, just admit it. Wow. We know the ACLU supports the Bill of Rights Minus One, the American Civil (some) Liberties Union. Even after Heller, they stubbornly maintain the incorrect and completely out-of-context "collective right" belief. But usually when another rights is concerned they support it even where it involves gun rights. It's sad to see them bending their principles so far for this. Unless there is a hearing where a judge weighs the evidence, and you can give evidence in your defense, it's not due process. If there's no standard bureaucratic method for removal from the list, it's not due process. Overall they have a huge problem, with frighteningly large numbers of Muslims being quite radicalized. 25% of them think the 7/7 attacks in London were justified. Overall, there is a dangerous level of support for terror acts. In Britain, 5% of Muslims wouldn't even report a planned terror attack to the government if the knew of one. That may not sound like a big percentage, but that's 135,000 people. It's public domain, no copyright, it belongs to the people. I love the honesty, actually giving him a checkmark. Often, fact check sites try to find some excuse to skew something anti-gun, giving leeway to anti-gun claims, being strict on pro-gun claims. I am a full supporter of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act because of its focus on nuisance suits. Normally, the background check was done, so the store has no liability. However, this suit may be allowed because in (5)(A)(ii) it allows suits for negligent entrustment. In (5)(b) that's defined as:

&gt;the supplying of a qualified product [a gun] by a seller for use by another person when the seller knows, or reasonably should know, the person to whom the product is supplied is likely to, and does, use the product in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical injury to the person or others.

Now look at this part of the article:

&gt;when it sold Colby Sue Weathers the gun in June 2012 ... two days after her mother warned the store that her daughter was mentally ill.

She warned the store, so they knew the daughter constituted an unreasonable risk of injury. This may fail under normal tort, but there is a provision in the law for this suit not to be completely prohibited. I call this yet another win for the  Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, because contrary to Clinton's lies, it's not blanket immunity. That's one long shower.So if a customer uses only 1 GB in a month, you'll only bill him 1/300th the normal fee, right? 

I pay for a set bandwidth, and higher bandwidths command higher fees. I don't pay for amount of traffic.Not directly, but it's part of a larger program to make guns less acceptable in society, which further down the road will allow violation of gun rights with less resistance. And then we get to sue people for making baseless claims. Only three more payments until I can get high!No sympathy for straw buyers. However, why did he even do it? That couple were capable of buying the rifles on their own. It wasn't random, it was targeted. But my point remains, the law has a mechanism by which dealers can be sued for real negligence. It's up to the court to determine if this was negligence, and to let the suit continue or not. &gt;There are already anti-nuisance laws in existence.

None were protecting the gun industry as it was inundated by nuisance suits from private groups and governments designed to put them out of business. This isn't paranoia, this was their stated intent. New York's AG threatened to bankrupt Glock through lawsuits if they didn't play ball. They actually succeeded with Charter Arms. Most gun companies don't have the margins to go up against a deep-pocket lawsuit. 

&gt;For example - manufacturers can't be held liable for negligently selling the guns to high risk buyers. 

In gun law, knowing is a very big thing. It's a crime for anyone to sell a gun to someone he "knows or has reasonable cause to believe" is prohibited, or is from another state buying a handgun. Similarly, the PLCFA exempts suits where the dealer "knows or should have known" there is high risk in selling to that person. In this case, the mother informed them of the risk. 

&gt;If you substitute prescription drugs for guns, your lawsuit is more likely to be thrown out. 

That would be equivalent to a gun dealer buying a batch of guns that are known to be defective. Lawsuits over actual product defects are explicitly allowed by the PLCFA. A couple such suits have been initiated since the PLCFA, and they have not been blocked under it. Thanks for the clarification. Of course, in a rational copyright scheme as intended by the Founders, all of this would have been public domain decades ago. That's a responsible FFL, and they'd be completely covered under the law. These guys ignored the warning, which may have opened themselves up to a lawsuit. &gt;Then how do you provide a framework for someone who rightfully believes that their family member should not own a gun to get that information out there?

That is interesting. However, probably going to the store and explaining what's going on would get the store off the hook. This is a pretty narrow case here, the mother saying the daughter is dangerous, normally a trusted claim. I wouldn't expand it much more than that. The shooter already had a handgun, he passed the check. 

Edit: I have to take some of that back though. Thinking about it again, I disagree with this definition of straw buyer. That term was initially used to describe someone who bought a gun for someone who was prohibited from doing it himself. What's the real problem with buying a gun for someone who could pass his own background check? This is only illegal because, without a corresponding change in law, the ATF put a line in the 4473 not allowing "buying for someone else" as an acceptable option. It's bureaucratic rule, not democratic. &gt;The gun industry wasn't excluded from the existing nuisance laws.

State a nuisance law the gun industry could have sought refuge under. 

&gt;This liability protection exceeds what's reasonable 

Not at all. All lawsuits relating to True product defects, any illegal acts performed (like knowingly selling to straw buyers), contract violation, and several other things are allowed. These are things where the business actually has a logical liability. Not long ago, a dealer lost a multi-million dollar suit because he knowingly sold to a straw buyer and the gun was later used to shoot someone. 

&gt;I have seen zero evidence that the gun industry required more protections than pharmaceutical companies. 

They were being sued for manufacturing and selling perfectly functional products according to all applicable laws and regulations. Has the pharmaceutical industry ever been sued where the drug worked perfectly and all laws and regulations were followed? Basically, it was like suing the car makers for all drunk driving deaths where the cars were in perfect working order and met all safety regulations. 

&gt;Not at all.

You started with defective products, stick with defective products. Don't jump around. Defective products are not protected by the PLCFA.

Here is a proper analogy to sales of perfectly functioning guns in the gun industry resulting in lawsuits: The pharmacy being sued for filling a valid Percocet prescription, where the buyer later sold them on the black market to someone who overdosed. Sorry, the pharmacy followed all rules and regulations, and there's no way the pharmacy could have known of the later illegal acts using the legally dispensed drugs. 

Now if that pharmacy is selling the guy 20 Percocet prescriptions a month from different doctors, there may be a problem. Similarly, if a gun dealer allows what he knows or should have known is an illegal purchase, he isn't protected under the PLCFA.&gt;The EU has a relatively rational copyright term (Life +70) which allows children and grandchildren to benefit

How is that rational? I work, my children benefit. I stop working, the benefit to my children from my work stops. Why should copyright keep benefiting? The purpose of copyright in the US is to encourage authors to create more works. You can't create more works if you're dead. No, it's considered a straw purchase, period. Intent is completely out of the equation, even if intentions are completely innocent. When it comes to gun control, a slope has been firmly established. Slippery slope is only a logical fallacy if it's too far-reaching or has no logical connection. I have to admit, the more Democrats crank up their anti gun rights rhetoric, the more they push me away from voting Democrat. &gt;In the creative industries, income is highly unpredictable, and can even only begin earning after the creator's death 

If you're not earning during your lifetime, you have no real incentive to keep copyright anyway, because you have no incentive to create more works. 

&gt;Partly. 

Completely. It's right there in the text. 

&gt;Who would do that if any day the author could croak and their power to make money from their investment vanishes?

This is why initially the term was 14 years with a 14 year extension. That is sane and reasonable. Given longer lifespans today, maybe 20+20 would be reasonable. Anything more isn't. &gt;You said there's a "larger program to make guns less acceptable in society". 

Yes, there is. They ban all references to guns in schools, and have almost eliminated school shooting sports. Not all that long ago, kids would take real gun safety courses in school with real guns, and could even bring one to school if they planned on hunting afterwards. Today, they arrest a kid who went bird hunting before school and left his shotgun in his truck parked off school grounds. 

&gt;Yet gun sales are at all time highs.

I didn't say they were succeeding. In many ways their program has backfired, like when Frankie Goes to Hollywood's relatively unknown single Relax was prohibited in the BBC, making it very popular. 



Remember, nobody wants to take your guns. Can't wait for the first combined 2nd and 5th Amendment lawsuit. Good catch, he is definitely wrong. Luckily, few Christians take this stuff as a literal command for how to behave today. &gt;Literally any nuisance law on the books as they would already prevent any illegitimate claims.

Couldn't find one, huh?

&gt;As I've stated, this law is designed to provide liability protection for actions that in nearly any other scenario would have been liable. 

Would Ford be liable for someone using an F150 to run over people? No. The main problem was people and governments suing the gun industry over the equivalent of that. 

&gt;The law shields exactly the liability in question. Otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation. 

It might help if you actually [read the law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/7903) instead of listening to Clinton. It explicitly excludes what I listed from protection. 

&gt;If there was no legitimate harm or legal standing, the lawsuits would be tossed. That's the law. 

The problem was them exploring new theories of harm that included engaging in lawful commerce according to the regulations. They had big pockets, including government pockets, and were running the defendants into the ground with legal fees regardless of merit. They were abusing the courts to do what the legislature decided was not good public policy.

Basically, they were suing that pharmacy for legally dispensing a valid prescription for Percocet because they don't Percocet. That some abuse it is the harm claimed, and their theory is that the pharmacy is responsible. 

&gt; My analogy isn't about defective products.

"sell you a prescription that turns out to be of poor quality and you have a heart attack. " Poor quality that causes injury = defective. Where guns function exactly as marketed and intended, the industry is protected. Where they fail and cause injury, whether due to design flaw or poor craftsmanship, the gun industry is not protected. People were suing the industry where the guns were of high quality and functioned perfectly. 

&gt;It's about ignoring unnecessary risk and the subsequent negligence that follows

The law defines what dealers and manufacturers are required to do in order to mitigate risk from their end. There are a lot of laws and regulations regarding their responsibilities. Subsequent negligence is no more their fault than a drunk driver is the fault of Ford.&gt;Sorry Conservatives, but your freedom is about to expire.

It's nice to see an anti-gun person admit their program is an overt effort to suppress freedom. &gt; but that's because in my state you have to be registered with a party to vote in their primary

I've been tempted to register only for that reason. The people who care to vote are already voting. These are people most likely to learn about the candidates and issues.

Then there are people who don't care to vote. These people are thus also not as likely learn anything about the candidates and issues. They choose to remain ignorant on these subjects.  

These are the only people who would be forced to vote, meaning they would be the addition to the existing voting trends.

The article claims mandatory voting would shift to the left. 

This means that the most ignorant voters vote left. 

I'm not making the claim, that's the logic of the article. Why does that sound familiar? /s&gt;I didn't bother as literally any general nuisance law would 

Yep, couldn't find one. 

&gt;It would depend on if Ford acted negligently. 

We are talking about a regular sale of a car according to all laws and regulations. Find me a case where a car maker was sued for the later subsequent illegal use of the car after the sale. 

&gt;ere's legal advice arguing that employers are liable for employees' accidents and car owners are liable for lending out their car to friends

The article rests on two concepts. The applicable concept is negligent entrustment. The PLCFA does not shield in the event of negligent entrustment. It's right there in the law, if you'd bothered to read it. Permissive use doesn't apply because the gun industry doesn't retain ownership of the guns, and they're not cars. 

&gt;Medling had rented the car from Federico Chrysler, which is accused of leasing the car to someone under the influence of illicit drugs.

The rental agency retained ownership of the car, it was not a sale. This does have an equivalent with gun shops though. Gun shops do background checks, like this rental agency didn't. Gun dealers are also not immune to lawsuit under the PLCFA if they knew or should have known that person would commit an illegal act with the gun. 

Gun dealers are under much tighter regulation than car rental agencies. Because of the regulation, a gun dealer following the law wouldn't even be in the situation described in you article. If he didn't follow the law, he wouldn't be immune. 

&gt;fundamentally recognize that you are liable for any risks you ignore that contribute harm to another person. 

Yes, and when that gun shop let an obvious straw buyer buy a gun for a prohibited person, thus ignoring clear risk, it was sued, and it lost. The PLCFA did not shield it.

&gt; I have read the law. 

Obviously not, since you said: "The law shields exactly the liability in question" in response to me listing, from the law, acts that explicitly are not shielded. Your other comments also show that you have not read the law. &gt;That's because schools are gun free zones

One step in demonizing guns. Also, read that again. He was parked off school grounds. 

&gt;Another reason shooting sports was dropped is because of funding. 

Not the main reason. 

&gt;If it's "backfired" then there shouldn't be the slippery slope to a gun free America that you insinuated earlier. 

The cultural effort somewhat backfired, but in ways it has succeeded. The legal effort has enacted restriction after restriction for over 100 years. At least for whites. Blacks had restrictions going back to the 1700s. Ignorant means lacking information on a subject. I myself, for example, am quite ignorant on the subject of music theory. Their apathy and laziness are the cause of the ignorance, because they do not have the desire to learn. Suddenly, these people will be forced to vote, and it's not likely that will make them choose to learn. I said they were nuisance suits. You said there were protections from these suits in existing laws. You refuse to provide a source.The set of the people who care to learn largely intersects with the set of people who care to vote. Those who both care to learn and don't care to vote are a minority.Another Bush legacy about to bite the dust, and well-deserved props to Obama if he signs.Yet our crime rate continues to go down along with theirs, and without a mass violation of rights.Includes suicides as "gun violence."

Spend the rest on ammo."It shoots through schools."So? Many important people have been in Playboy, including Jimmy Carter.&gt;Your assertion is that traditional nuisance laws imply an exemption for manufacturing.

My assertion is that these suits were nuisances. And they were. The statements by the plaintiffs show they intended to harm the industry overall.

&gt; Let's start with that list as I can't think of a single nuisance law that exempts the gun industry. 

You're the one claiming the PLCFA isn't needed because the industry was protected from nuisance suits by existing law. But as you've found out, it wasn't. 

&gt;And yet it does because of the narrow definition of negligent entrustment.

It's used perfectly. The plaintiffs in the article tried to stretch negligent entrustment to absurdity, "The argument there is that Bushmaster created a weapon for the military and that it was negligent to market that to the general public." Negligent entrustment operates on a per-person basis, if the entrustor knew or should have known the entrustee would do something bad, whether it's a gun, a car, or a  baseball bat. The PLCFA does not protect from this. 

You're stretching negligent entrustment to a statement that Ford should be liable for putting cars on the market that people can use to drive drunk or distracted, causing accidents. You can't "entrust" an object to the general public. The PLCFA's codifying of the common definition is to ensure this absurd expanded concept of negligent entrustment won't be applied by some anti-gun activist judge willing to stretch the law for the cause. &gt;The guns the couple wanted were illegal in Cali,

The guns were purchased legally in California initially, because they were California-legal. Later, they were modified to be like what they are in most other states, where you can push the magazine eject button with your finger. That is the illegal feature -- a gun that works like it was designed to 60 years ago. 

&gt;Also, I think there's some hoops to buy a semi rifle in Cali that they wanted to avoid

There are no more hoops than a pistol that I know of. &gt;Restriction after restriction? The Heller decision

Yes, thousands of restrictions nationwide, and you begrudge the people a rare win. 

&gt;that even staunch conservatives disagreed with circa 1990. 

Back in 1900 it was legal to have machine gun shipped to you through the mail, no background check. You could crank up a gun making business without any special licenses, and sell to whomever you want. 

&gt;You can still sell or buy a gun, with cash or check, with no background check, from anyone, virtually anywhere in America.

Yes, this is called the private sale of a legal item. Well, it's not a legal sale if the seller has any reason to suspect the buyer is prohibited. 

&gt;I can have a silencers delivered to my front door in the mail online. 

If you want to go to federal prison, sure, go for it.

To obtain a silencer you must find a dealer who has a special license to deal with silencers. If he has the silencer you want in stock, you're good. If not, he has to order one, and he needs to get ATF permission to do that, so it could take a while. But once you're at your dealer with your silencer, you fill out a three-page ATF Form 5320-4. Unless you have a legal trust, you have to go get permission from your local law enforcement, along with two original fingerprint cards, which you will have to pay for. Then you pay your dealer for the silencer and send this form in duplicate to the ATF along with $200. After possibly several months wait, the ATF approves this form after a background check. You then can go back to your dealer again, fill out the Form 4473, have another background check done, and finally take possession of your silencer. Note that if you ever move you need to notify the ATF. All of this considers that silencers are legal in your state. If not, then none of this is even possible for regular people. 

Whew! Long paragraph. All this for what is just a safety device you can get off the shelf in Europe.
&gt;Your first sentence is correct, your second is insulting.

Insulting doesn't mean incorrect. 

&gt; would like to see a change away from first-past-the-post voting

We agree there. I'm tired of protest votes. I was thinking the due process provisions of the 5th. There's no due process at all in the list. Including ours, with a large increase in guns possessed and carried. &gt;I said there were protections from these suits in existing laws and thus a nuisance law was redundant. 

And yet you failed to provide one example. 

&gt;Here's a goddamned example.

I love the complete switch between the legal concepts of nuisance on the fly. This article is about an act that is a nuisance. We are discussing lawsuits that are in themselves nuisances. The US started higher too, but has been going down about the same amount.Insurance, there's another. It was never an issue for a hundred years, then all the sudden it's not insurable. I think the 14th only applies when the states are violating due process. I love that part. We as consumers have no service level agreement, so the ISP is under no obligation to consistently supply the stated bandwidth, yet we will always pay the same. You need to get high-end business class and pay $$$ to get an SLA.Okay, $5 plus $0.x per gigabyte. Comcast's problem is that they want it both ways.

That's got to be rare as hell, because this is generally done alone. It would be more applicable to people jumping off buildings or in front of trucks, which is done in public. No, you don't get to count it as "gun violence." When they said this about Obama, it was racist. &gt;Such as? 

Gun free zones, city ordinances, county ordinances, state laws, federal laws, and huge number of state and federal regulations.

&gt;You could also open up a tannery right next to a school and pour blood, chemicals, and anything else you wanted into the nearby creek.

That's direct harm to others. Shipping and possession of a collection of metal, wood and plastic does no direct harm to anyone. 

&gt; You can't do that anymore either and it's not because of some left-wing conspiracy against capitalism, so what's your point?

You brought us back to the point of view of people in 1900 as a statement that we've become more liberal with gun laws, so you get to live with what that point of view actually was. Gun laws were far more liberal in 1900, as long as you were white. 

&gt;Any stats on the number of people charged with illegal guns sales that were initially considered private?

What do you mean initially? Either they were private, or they weren't.

&gt;I'm familiar with the process of getting a silencer

Apparently not, since you said you could order one on the Internet and have it delivered to your door, just like you could order one by mail and have it shipped to your door in the early 1900s. That should be the situation here, but the reality is that it's not. 

&gt;You'd be hard pressed to view those situations as restrictions, yet you view similar concepts in relation to guns as restrictions.

These are restrictions on a fundamental right. If the level of restriction wouldn't be acceptable with speech, it shouldn't be acceptable with guns. Also, there's nobody calling for the banning of any of those things you mentioned, so we're not worried about incrementalism. MSNBC&gt;If the CDC actually collected data on guns, they are breaking the law.

This is incorrect. They are only prohibited from funding research designed to support the gun control agenda. 

&gt;That's not a government agency

The CDC rarely did it's own gun research in the past either. They farmed it out to people who they knew would produce anti-gun results. Basically, they were doing the same thing the Tobacco companies did to produce research showing smoking is safe. &gt;Explain to me how allowing the Federal Government to perform nonpartisan research

Nonpartisan research is not prohibited, only partisan research. Prohibited from doing partisan research, the CDC has chosen to do no research at all. Curious, huh?There are practically no guns in Japan, but with a suicide rate far higher than ours. People will find a method.I have to give him credit for signing the law that stops the Bush era travesty, although Congress deserves blame since it was passed with broad support from both parties. You realize anybody can edit Wikipedia, and that it has a leftist slant. Their first source is a known anti-gun organization. It has the veneer of cover by a university, but the project is run by Philip Alpers, a man with no academic credentials, and who is the former head of two virulently anti-gun groups. Wikipedia even continues to use the False term "gun show loophole" as the title for the article on the legal private sale of firearms as intended by Congress (intended = by definition no loophole). 

Yeah, Wikipedia is trustworthy when it comes to things like this. Some pages are protected by anti-gun people. &gt;Ok. Devils advocate. If the CDC does partisan research, how great do you think the impact will be on gun rights? 

Politicians and groups are still using the figures from shoddy research done before the ban to advance the gun control agenda, so I'd say the impact is enough to be dangerous. 

The research was really designed to provide sound bites for the gun control crowd. In the same shoddy research that said you're more likely to be killed if you have a gun in the house, living alone, renting, and doing drugs were all more correlated to death by firearm than owning one yourself. You'll never hear these in the news, because the study was designed to get just the quote about guns out to help the cause. &gt;You show up at work at 6 while it's still dark (during winter) and when you finish working, it's dark again. 

Reminds me of the Army. I remember once working over 50 hours straight, eat on the run.We do not appreciate the public policy that the duly elected representatives of the people have enacted; therefore, we shall exercise our kingly prerogative and invalidate their will through executive fiat. 

Damn, and I thought I was mad at Bush for pretending he could be king through executive order. Think of this as an opportunity rather than a curse. The next time someone says rhetorically "Well, what do you know?" to something curious, you get to respond "Nothing." Or they do know something, and that's why they voted this way. Even outside of the terror context, I'm not too keen on their disdain for freedom of religion and freedom of speech. &gt;Product of the War on Drugs and not a gun restriction

Gun free zone = gun restriction. There's a separate drug restriction. 

&gt;They aren't direct harm and yet, go into effect everyday. Noise, odor, dust...

Still an immediate effect on others, and noise, odor and dust is harming their quality of life. A gun does no harm to anyone unless it's actually used. I understand and support the application of general ordinances to guns, such as noise ordinances. I even support prohibition of shooting needlessly in a crowded city, since the act is an imminent danger to others. But still, mere possession of a gun neither harms anyone, nor puts them in immediate danger. 

&gt;I brought you back to 1990 in regards to a staunchly conservative justice who still didn't think you had the right to individually own a gun.

Yes, I did misread. I need to put this on the bigger monitor. So you're referring to Berger, who said that not in any decision or scholarly article, but as a personal opinion in 1990, years after he had retired. It doesn't hold much weight. 

&gt;I assume that some of them were conducted by pawn shops or gun shops and were classified as straw sales

Those are just up front illegal. 

&gt;You can though.

First, you made it sound like you can just order one, when you can't. You need two trips to an FFL to do it. Second, unless you yourself are licensed for the business then no, you can't have it mailed to you. Any regular person has to pick it up on the premises where the FFL is licensed to conduct business. 

&gt;But speech is restricted.

Cue the "not this shit again" meme. Speech only gets restricted at the point of action. You say something that falls under a few very narrow free speech exceptions, constituting an illegal act. Guns are restricted and regulated without them ever having been used to perform an illegal act. There is simply no comparison between free speech restrictions and gun control. 

&gt;You also can't peacefully protest when and where you like either, that's also restricted, but its dependent on some other factors. 

Again, at the actual time of an act, and only to protect immediate public health and safety during the act. Any imposition of requirements beyond this bare minimum that would tend to otherwise suppress the protest is considered unconstitutional. For example, a high fee for a protest permit would be unconstitutional. The $200 tax on suppressors and various weapons was implemented when that was effectively $3,500, and it was designed to discourage possession. That could not fly in anything relating to free speech. 

&gt;Virtually all of our Bill of Rights, our fundamental rights, have restrictions/limitations/etc., that could suffer from incrementalism, and the dissenters' voices are barely heard about most of it; except for guns. 

People have been pretty loud about the 4th in relation to the War on Drugs and the Patriot Act. Freedom of religion has been a big issue, especially in regards to Obamacare. Freedom of speech in regards to Citizens United. All of these concepts have seen much more Supreme Court action than the 2nd. 

&gt;in theory, I think banning anything is an exercise in futility, whether it be gay marriage, abortions, drugs, alcohol, guns, sex

That's True, it just creates a criminal underground to provide the product. &gt; How does suicide by a firearm (gun) NOT gun violence?

When I start to hear "gravity violence" in regards to jumpers, "pharmaceutical violence" in regards to people who OD, "chemical violence" in relation to those who poison, "rope violence" in relation to hangings, and "water violence" in relation to drownings, then I will believe that the term "gun violence" in relation to gun suicides isn't just a cheap attempt to demonize guns. Then that is one incident of gun violence (the murder) and one incident of suicide. The suicide isn't put into the murder column for the stats, it's not gun violence. &gt;We're talking about laws that protect against nuisance suits. 

You have refused to show one law that would have protected the gun industry from nuisance suits before the PLCFA. &gt;A number of guns primary purpose is to literally kill people.

So? That is irrelevant. We're talking about acts committed. If you do not call those other things violence in relation to suicide, then you have no cause to label gun suicide as gun violence. You can't really control suicide much except to try to stop people from wanting to do it. &gt;I gain nothing from continuing this

You could realize that using the word "gun violence" in relation to suicide is invalid and designed to influence a political debate, but you choose not to. If I search "knife violence" I get results relating to crimes committed using knives. Knives are designed to kill as much as guns are, and people kill themselves with knives, but no mention of suicide. But when it comes to "gun violence," suicide is in every article. 

The term has been twisted to try to pump up the "gun violence" numbers that are actually much smaller. Offensive facts are not allowed.The purpose of manufacture is irrelevant. But even if it were, many guns are not made with the intent to kill a human. This includes all hunting, varmint, target, and competition rifles (which includes many AR-15s), most shotguns, and many pistols. Of those guns created with the intent to kill someone, they either created to kill legally in the context of war, or legally in the context of self protection. 

Not one gun in this country is made with the intent of any unlawful action, such as murder. Yes, Trump lies. He lies about this and that statistic, basically throwing shit to the wind and seeing what happens. But Clinton lies to protect herself, and I find that much more disturbing. A declaration of war can take whatever form Congress decides. The only constitutional issue here is that the President has the blessing of Congress when making war. If you look at our declaration of war against Japan in WWII it declares that a state of war exist (recognizing one, not starting one), and then goes on to authorize the use of military force. The latter part of that is the important one, and it's what Congress has been doing since then. &gt;But basically, what do you have to do to get on a terrorist watch list? 

At a minimum, piss off some bureaucrat, or have some distant family you've never met piss off some bureaucrat, or have the same name as someone who pissed off some bureaucrat. 

&gt;And if not, what other constitutional rights can the government deny American citizens without at least a trial to determine guilt?

Not everything needs a trial. But everything needs due process, as in having your say before a judge, having a chance to refute charges against you, having the ability to have erroneous entries removed. No liberty should be restricted without that. &gt;In fact the ONLY person I can think of that was on the terror watch list at some time and there was proof they actually had killed somebody was the late Senator Ted Kennedy.

Sir Reginald is late to Tiny Tina's tea party.&gt;I said can we ask IF we can implement laws

If you are actually making no claim as to the efficacy of the Democrat-proposed gun laws, then I apologize. 

&gt;he first amendment says we have freedom of speech yet we have declared some speech to be against the law. Why is the second amendment not subject to discussion?

If we even had that discussion, it's long over. We all accept that threatening someone with a gun, brandishing a gun, shooting it negligently in populated areas, etc., are illegal. You won't find any pro-rights person to contest that, any more than we would contest that someone threatening to kill someone should be illegal. But nobody's proposing new laws like that. They want new laws that infringe on the right without the individual ever having done anything wrong. The State Department knew it was a terror attack. The CIA was drafting a memo to the President that said it was a terror attack. It went through a few revisions with State Department input that downplayed the terror angle and to claim it was a demonstration gone bad. This is what the State Department told the people. After the public found out it was a terror attack, the State Department tried to blame the initial False assessment on the CIA memo that said it was a demonstration, but you see above that was a lie.

The scandal here is that the State Department lied to the people to benefit the president during an election, and tried to cover it up when caught. None of this is illegal, just highly unethical, which is what we've come to expect from Clinton. As for the people who were killed, our overseas interests have been getting attacked by terrorists since at least the 1970s. Yes, it was unfortunate, but it's not a scandal. Here, the Republicans are trying to fabricate a scandal.&gt; "Congress shall make no law" and yet things that don't pose a direct threat like libel and slander are not protected speech.

Libel and slander are a civil issue between you and the person you allegedly wronged. It is not a criminal issue, not a government regulation issue, it's a civil tort like anything can be. You damaged his reputation, he wants compensation for the damage, and a court order to quit doing the damage. It falls outside the subject of this conversation. Even if it did, it covers specific instances of action made by one person against another. It is not an overall prohibition or regulation. 

&gt;It's not unreasonable to think that the court could rule in a similar manner for some type of restrictions with guns.

I can't see an equivalent civil tort issue with guns. Every instance I can think of where one person can harm another with a gun is a criminal offense, not a civil tort. 

&gt;But shown enough evidence that legislation could reduce gun violence and doesn't have a negative impact towards legally abiding gun owners.

I'd love to hear one. 

&gt;It just bothers me that any time gun control is talked about, the pro gun people like the guy in the video start talking like guns will be banned

This is because the main people pushing for laws do want a ban. 

&gt; as opposed to looking to see if there could be an effective law beyond that.

There is no reasonable evidence that they want an effective law as you state above. If they did, they would propose potentially effective laws. Mandatory universal background checks, "assault weapons" bans, waiting periods, "high-capacity" magazine bans, mandated microstamping and "smart" guns, etc., none of these have the potential to be anywhere near effective, and they all place a burden on regular gun owners.It was probably something far-fetched, like "Quit killing Jews."At least Asheville, Charlotte, Durham and Chapel Hill.That was a bit joking, but this one is definitely a sticking point, "Recognize the right of the Jewish state of Israel to exist." In a sea of Muslim states, the mere existence of a Jewish state is quite offensive to them. It's hard to negotiate peace with people who won't even recognize your right to exist. Everything from 1968 should be public domain by now. People were actually offended by that? What did the kids create? Nothing. Originally it was 14 years plus a 14-year extension if you still care to keep the copyright. This was designed to give a return for the duration of a decent portion of the creator's life. People live longer now, so extend that to 20+20, and all 1968 copyrights should have expired in 2008.She simultaneously will and will not support decriminalization until we vote her into office, and then she'll do what she wants. 

Schroedinger's candidate. He seems pretty reasonable in Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin? Sister's psycho though. &gt;Kids get to inherit other possessions and wealth when their parents die

They could inherit the remaining term of the copyright. Since the purpose of copyright is to encourage the creation of new works, technically copyright should end at death, since dead people don't create. 

&gt; It would seem a bit unfair to allow one kid that grew up rich to remain rich because his parents owned a business, and another kid gets shafted because his dad made his money from a book or a movie.

Let's say your business is baseball player, does your kid get to inherit your talent? No, the money stream dies with the talent. Creating works is a talent just like that. Any inheritance can come from money made while dad was alive, and the remainder of the copyright term. Wow. Poor guy fell in with SJWs.Technically. The off-limits areas are so numerous that many people would find it difficult to carry. A lot of rich people are liberal, so the "simple reason" doesn't work.

Yes, we are moving in the direction of our rights being recognized and expanded, and those who want to oppress rights are failing.

Blowing up is a rational response to this, but their ire should be directed at the legislature that did it, not the store that has to follow screwed-up rules. The background check is only authorization, not a commitment. I've heard many LGS workers deny scales because they got a bad vibe from the person. They live in the communities that they're selling guns in, so they have a vested interest in not selling to such people. &gt;I dislike it, but unilateral disarmament doesn't fix anything either.

There's no billionaire on the pro-rights side of this, just millions of people donating to their cause. Thank you for not saying "for all intensive purposes."Case names like "United States vs $8,100 in cash" make me want to laugh, it it weren't so damn sad. Even worse, you normally have to post a bond before you can even challenge the forfeiture. Since the government just took all your money, it's often difficult to come up with the money for the bond. If you're delivering the bond in cash, they might just seize that too.A criminal conviction requires "beyond a reasonable doubt" before you are deprived of your money. This is a civil proceeding against your money, so the government only has to prove by a "preponderance of the evidence" standard. 

And that's after they've taken your stuff, you've had to post a bond, hire a lawyer, and fight against the resources of the government. One guy who ran a charter airline service once had as a passenger a suspected drug money courier.  The feds took the money and the plane that was his livelihood. The drug people took it as a regular business loss and forgot about the cash. The pilot fought against the government for years, and eventually found it cheaper just to buy his plane back at auction. BfC could have been really good, but all of the lies, misrepresentations, and inaccuracies kind of screwed it up. &gt; if he'd simply taken the money he inherited from his father and invested it in a standard fund, he'd be a lot richer today

If he had zero living expenses, invested, and pulled out before various crashes and reinvested after, then yes. At the worst of his bankruptcy around 1990 he was limited to $50,000 a month living expenses (around $90,000 today). The way he's lived would have drained the capital quickly. Only is business acumen has allowed him to keep growing his fortune.&gt;Well one is a lot tastier

Grasshoppers are tastier than a lot of plants. Lobsters are even more tasty, and they don't really even have a brain. They react to stimuli, just like plants do, no more. My problem is that there is way too much advance strategy, matching plays against, plays, etc., done by various non-playing strategists long before the game. The QB will have studied this and basically built a book of offensive plays in response to defenses. He also has a helmet radio to the sidelines, who has communications with the offensive strategist up in the press booth with a birdseye view, all to ensure he makes the right plays. At actual play time, which only lasts a few seconds at a time, there is some room for the QB to show his talent, but this is limited in both options and time. After the play, we go back to the strategists again. The QB also only has to know one thing: offense. When the other side gets the ball he goes off the field. 

Compare to a sport like soccer, where you have a constant fluid action with the players having to respond to the opposition's constantly-changing plays on the field over tens of minutes, all on their own. The same team has to play both offense and defense constantly, and can find themselves flipping between the two a few times a minute. One second the opposition almost made a goal against you, and five seconds later you're on their end of the field making a drive for a goal against them. Everyone has to be able to think strategically and on the fly. Even the goalie has to watch how the game is progressing downfield to make sure he's positioned correctly to counter any attack, which may arrive in only seconds. He may move forward to attempt to preemptively take the ball during an attack, but his goal is exposed if he misses, or he may sit back by the goal, which is dangerous if none of his players are there to help. 

As far as physical assets, he has to do intense activity for only a few seconds at a time, maybe 6 minutes or so of activity throughout a game (the average NFL game being 11 minutes of actual play), ensuring he stays well-rested. Soccer players are playing for 45 minutes at a stretch, although often being able to break into a walk for short periods. If play is stopped after a goal or because of injury, they play that much more time to make up for it, so it's always 45 minutes of play per half regardless. They need to have absolute control over the ball with their feet, being able to kick it 50+ yards, including putting just the right amount of spin on it to achieve the correct path. When going for a goal or throw-in, a long reach and being able to jump very high are assets, plus a hard head for heading the ball. In general I have a problem with people abusing retail workers. It's one of the slimiest things you can do in this society. You can't return an item? He didn't set the return policy. Why are you screaming at him? He's just trying to make a living. You want him to risk his job for you, someone he doesn't even know?I take it this happened. I was thinking that too, but then we do end up with the problem of that being a disincentive later in life, and the copyright allowance is about incentive. You're 80 and know you only have a couple years left? Why bother spending a year to write something when you'll only get a year of income? That's why I like 20 years, plus the original author can extend for another 20 years. This makes the maximum only 20 years after death, if the author dies right at publishing time. &gt;Property is not more worthy versus a human life. 

In most cases, you're not shooting because of the property, you're shooting because the robber is threatening the life of all present. Threats to life must be taken at face value -- if the threat is made, you must assume it is a serious threat. Given that threat, lethal force is justified in defense of the innocents present. 

If a mugger came up to you with a gun and threatened to kill you if you don't hand over your wallet, would you just push the gun aside and keep walking? If not, that means you take the threat to your life seriously, meaning this is about innocent life, not property.Aluminum is soft, but aluminum oxide is hard. Any bare piece of aluminum you see will have a very thin layer of aluminum oxide on it. Normally this is a good thing, since the oxide protects the aluminum from further corrosion. For going on the real cheap, get an old .22 LR bolt action, used for well under $200. Play the poor soldier deal, and you may get one for around $100. Go to your local VFW post and ask if anyone has an old .22 that a young soldier can buy to train with. Someone might even just give you one. 

Spend the rest on ammo and range time. Join a good club, and practice your basics there. Probably the next step up in low cost would be a semi-auto Marlin Model 60. The .380 isn't all that well known as a target round. But if you want target, I wouldn't go with the Sig for its long DAO pull. With the polymer frame the Sig should be lighter too, which would mean more recoil. 

If the whole point is target, and you're limited to under .380,  think about going to .22 LR with a Ruger Mark I/II/III or 22/45, or a Browning Buckmark. You'll get a lot more shots for the money. &gt;\u201cAt what point are you going to consider me American enough?\u201d

We have a small minority that will call for it to be illegal, and we certainly don't want to import any more of that type into the country. True, but here the government gets to take the money first and put up roadblocks to you getting it back. They have it set up so that most honest people will just give up. 

Another case was of a small landscaper who liked to buy cash from a source in another state. He landed with about $8,000 on him. They took the money, and that was it. It would cost him much more than $8,000 to get it back, so fighting was useless.Supposedly liberal Democrats created the sentencing disparity in the first place. People think the Kochs are puppeteers, but they've got nothing on this guy. I'm okay with no net increase in revenue. What we take in gets spent on renewables. I can't tell whether you're sarcastic or not. I know my wife will be pissed if Clinton wins. The problem is that for those things that work well over there to work well over here, we have to be Denmark. It all exists as a whole system. You vastly overestimate the amount of firearms training the average military person gets. Most concealed carriers practice a lot more than the official training a military person gets, which is usually only a couple trips to the range each year. 

The problem in this article is that he wants the military to select a sidearm not solely on the basis of which one's best, but on the basis of which company plays ball with his anti-gun agenda. It's just another attempt to backdoor what Congress would otherwise vote down if he introduced it as a bill.People in Florida are concentrating on Stand Your Ground, but they should be looking at this. I'm still for something like the German system: Free college for people who are academically gifted and free trade school for people who aren't (or just want a trade instead). However, we'd need to overhaul our secondary education system before we could start something like this, and it would piss off both the right and the left. We have to tell the right that their for-profit colleges don't cut it, and we have to tell the left that no, not everybody gets to go to college in a merit-based system. No, we don't care that you came from a "disadvantaged household," you don't score well enough, so you go to trade school. I'm sure those people exist. I also knew soldiers who shot their pistols once every year, barely hitting half of the 30 targets.Ah, the brown ring of quality.He was one of the top neurosurgeons in the world solely due to his extraordinary abilities.

Technically a suppressor, but the inventor called it a silencer.Everytown wants to recruit you as their firearms expert. It's been zero for decades in the whole country. Among legally registered automatic weapons, we're at 2 in over 80 years. They prefer mass burnings now. Yep, and neither of them actually used the advantages of full-auto. In both cases it was just one guy shooting one other guy, could have used a pistol. 

Edit: This is why the whole .50 BMG demonizing also annoys me. While they have been used in few crimes by now, can anyone show where one .50 BMG has been used where no lesser rifle would have sufficed? They may say something like "Cop was shot through his car door at 300 yards and it killed him," but most regular hunting rifle rounds can do that. It's not a logical reason to single-out the .50 BMG for a ban. It can eat into a candidate's speaking time. She saw a gun and it hurt her feelings. Author should have said homicides. &gt; I'd like to point out that Communists and Capital-S Socialists generally like their guns. 

In theory you would think that, with the whole "power to the people" thing, but in practice they tend to restrict gun possession among the workers when they control a country. If you need moar powr from a .30-06 or .270 on occasion, you can do hot handloads (still within spec though, just the higher end of it). Get a longer barrel to make use of the hot loads, and you'll be getting close to 300 Win Mag velocities. Otherwise, you get the lower recoil and expense of a ubiquitous round. The Cuban constitution says they have the right to struggle, in the context of fighting against anyone who would overthrow Castro. But after the revolution, Castro began a program of confiscation, saying the people [have no more need for arms](http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1959/19590109.html) because now they have a government of the people that works for them. 

In the Soviet Union guns were [severely restricted from the beginning](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fguner.ru%2Frazreshitelnaya-sistema-v-rossii%2F). There was push back from the peasants who needed them for subsistence hunting, but then we know they didn't give a damn about the peasants. 

Your own link to Vietnam shows civilian ownership being severely restricted.They did it. It's the .416 Barrett, a .50 case slightly shortened, necked down to a .416 bullet. It's said to have better ballistics at ranges over 1,000 yards than the .50 BMG. Arguably, the move to ban the .50 resulted in a more dangerous round. I think the cop one was killing some informant, and the other was some Asian guy who went nuts and shot someone. Her conviction that she deserves to be president for 8 years after Obama stole it from her. But Obama was graceful, hiring her as Secretary of State so she could stay in the limelight coming up to her next chance. You can't know whether that guy controlling 6,000 pounds of car four feet from you at 45 mph will flick the wheel and splatter you all over the pavement. Yet we don't call the police about the regular traffic either. 

Now, someone walking with a gun and acting suspiciously, I'd report too. The problem is that the anti-gun people have flooded 9/11 with calls about people just because they are armed. They are doing this on purpose just to harass carriers, and some have even said they hope their calls will get the carriers shot by the police. It's hard for the police to tell who's crying wolf in this situation. The anti-gunners have definitely hurt public safety with their antics. Well, they lied to the regulators. The people were just looking at those awesome mpg numbers, and a VW diesel usually delivers better than what's listed. True, it was a crash rendered non-deadly by the parachute system. Yeah all you avid archers, you get to feel the pain of this PC no-tolerance crap too now. PC will never run out of people to demonize, because they'll just make up more as needed.If two people sincerely want to solve their differences according to their religious principles, that's their business. I see no reason to get involved. Where I disagree here is that should one party desire access to our secular court system, it should be public policy that it be allowed regardless of any previous agreement. Okay, a bit smaller bang bang. &gt;If you're not sure if there's a legitimate threat, you can report it. 

That's not what the movement wants. They say to call the second you see a gun, regardless of the actions or attitudes of the carrier. He could be just eating his sandwich in a booth, minding his own business, and they will call.  They say to do this in order to harass carriers, and hopefully to get them shot by the police in some warped sense of justice they have. The operator has probably heard this cry wolf a thousand times.

The equivalent is calling the cops about a maniac driver whenever you see someone calmly and legally driving down the street. Take this back some decades, and it would be like racists calling the police about a black man molesting a white woman whenever they saw an interracial couple. You have a legal act that some people don't like, so they want to SWAT them in revenge. It never gets down to that near-silent movie/video game sound. Evil Kochs, must be trying to hire henchmen for their empire. /sIt's not counted unless it's fired, hits the assailant, and kills the assailant.

Yes, it'll probably be the most fraud-free restaurant in town for at least a year. The punishment in the Quran for sex outside marriage is 100 lashes. so you are correct in that the Quran doesn't command this punishment. But the Quran doesn't forbid it either. Almost all Muslims accept Hadith as authoritative, and according to Sahih Muslim 17:4192, a married adulterer is to receive 100 lashes and then be stoned to death. This is the second most authoritative Hadith next to al-Bukhari for Sunnis, and they consider it 100% authoritative. 

TL;DR: Confining the defense to the Quran is a bit disingenuous when Hadith has authority too. They already did.That's some pretty twisted logic there. The bulk of Islamic jurisprudence throughout the ages disagrees with the author. 

Edit: Quran-only Muslims are a tiny mority, generally considered apostates by the larger Muslim community. It would be nice if Islam had a reformation, moving the bulk of adherents into the modern age. I actually like these nicer, more modern interpretations, but it's simply not what's believed by most Muslims. I want. It's a great little gun.

There's no love for criminals, just love for people whose activities shouldn't have been a crime in the first place.. Let the Democrats pass all their oppressive anti-gun laws, and have the conservatives violate them en masse, and liberals will be able to ask why conservatives "love criminals." Sir Reginald is late to Tiny Tina's tea party.&gt;I said can we ask IF we can implement laws

If you are actually making no claim as to the efficacy of the Democrat-proposed gun laws, then I apologize. 

&gt;he first amendment says we have freedom of speech yet we have declared some speech to be against the law. Why is the second amendment not subject to discussion?

If we even had that discussion, it's long over. We all accept that threatening someone with a gun, brandishing a gun, shooting it negligently in populated areas, etc., are illegal. You won't find any pro-rights person to contest that, any more than we would contest that someone threatening to kill someone should be illegal. But nobody's proposing new laws like that. They want new laws that infringe on the right without the individual ever having done anything wrong. The State Department knew it was a terror attack. The CIA was drafting a memo to the President that said it was a terror attack. It went through a few revisions with State Department input that downplayed the terror angle and to claim it was a demonstration gone bad. This is what the State Department told the people. After the public found out it was a terror attack, the State Department tried to blame the initial False assessment on the CIA memo that said it was a demonstration, but you see above that was a lie.

The scandal here is that the State Department lied to the people to benefit the president during an election, and tried to cover it up when caught. None of this is illegal, just highly unethical, which is what we've come to expect from Clinton. As for the people who were killed, our overseas interests have been getting attacked by terrorists since at least the 1970s. Yes, it was unfortunate, but it's not a scandal. Here, the Republicans are trying to fabricate a scandal.&gt; "Congress shall make no law" and yet things that don't pose a direct threat like libel and slander are not protected speech.

Libel and slander are a civil issue between you and the person you allegedly wronged. It is not a criminal issue, not a government regulation issue, it's a civil tort like anything can be. You damaged his reputation, he wants compensation for the damage, and a court order to quit doing the damage. It falls outside the subject of this conversation. Even if it did, it covers specific instances of action made by one person against another. It is not an overall prohibition or regulation. 

&gt;It's not unreasonable to think that the court could rule in a similar manner for some type of restrictions with guns.

I can't see an equivalent civil tort issue with guns. Every instance I can think of where one person can harm another with a gun is a criminal offense, not a civil tort. 

&gt;But shown enough evidence that legislation could reduce gun violence and doesn't have a negative impact towards legally abiding gun owners.

I'd love to hear one. 

&gt;It just bothers me that any time gun control is talked about, the pro gun people like the guy in the video start talking like guns will be banned

This is because the main people pushing for laws do want a ban. 

&gt; as opposed to looking to see if there could be an effective law beyond that.

There is no reasonable evidence that they want an effective law as you state above. If they did, they would propose potentially effective laws. Mandatory universal background checks, "assault weapons" bans, waiting periods, "high-capacity" magazine bans, mandated microstamping and "smart" guns, etc., none of these have the potential to be anywhere near effective, and they all place a burden on regular gun owners.It was probably something far-fetched, like "Quit killing Jews."At least Asheville, Charlotte, Durham and Chapel Hill.That was a bit joking, but this one is definitely a sticking point, "Recognize the right of the Jewish state of Israel to exist." In a sea of Muslim states, the mere existence of a Jewish state is quite offensive to them. It's hard to negotiate peace with people who won't even recognize your right to exist. Everything from 1968 should be public domain by now. People were actually offended by that? What did the kids create? Nothing. Originally it was 14 years plus a 14-year extension if you still care to keep the copyright. This was designed to give a return for the duration of a decent portion of the creator's life. People live longer now, so extend that to 20+20, and all 1968 copyrights should have expired in 2008.She simultaneously will and will not support decriminalization until we vote her into office, and then she'll do what she wants. 

Schroedinger's candidate. He seems pretty reasonable in Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin? Sister's psycho though. &gt;Kids get to inherit other possessions and wealth when their parents die

They could inherit the remaining term of the copyright. Since the purpose of copyright is to encourage the creation of new works, technically copyright should end at death, since dead people don't create. 

&gt; It would seem a bit unfair to allow one kid that grew up rich to remain rich because his parents owned a business, and another kid gets shafted because his dad made his money from a book or a movie.

Let's say your business is baseball player, does your kid get to inherit your talent? No, the money stream dies with the talent. Creating works is a talent just like that. Any inheritance can come from money made while dad was alive, and the remainder of the copyright term. Wow. Poor guy fell in with SJWs.Technically. The off-limits areas are so numerous that many people would find it difficult to carry. A lot of rich people are liberal, so the "simple reason" doesn't work.

Don't buy a $10 knife and toss it when it gets dull, or waste time constantly resharpening it because it can't hold a blade. Buy a really good knife for $80+ and it'll last for decades if you care for it right. My knives are 15-20 years old and still very sharp. 

Don't keep an old, dull knife because it makes cutting more difficult, and you more likely to cut yourself. ER visits cost money. OK&gt;Public opinion on guns seems to be going in the same direction as it did on same-sex marriage.

Yes, we are moving in the direction of our rights being recognized and expanded, and those who want to oppress rights are failing. Surveys about gun laws, answered by people who most likely don't even know what the current gun laws are, do not make a convincing argument.

Blowing up is a rational response to this, but their ire should be directed at the legislature that did it, not the store that has to follow screwed-up rules. The background check is only authorization, not a commitment. I've heard many LGS workers deny scales because they got a bad vibe from the person. They live in the communities that they're selling guns in, so they have a vested interest in not selling to such people. &gt;I dislike it, but unilateral disarmament doesn't fix anything either.

There's no billionaire on the pro-rights side of this, just millions of people donating to their cause. Thank you for not saying "for all intensive purposes."Case names like "United States vs $8,100 in cash" make me want to laugh, it it weren't so damn sad. Even worse, you normally have to post a bond before you can even challenge the forfeiture. Since the government just took all your money, it's often difficult to come up with the money for the bond. If you're delivering the bond in cash, they might just seize that too.A criminal conviction requires "beyond a reasonable doubt" before you are deprived of your money. This is a civil proceeding against your money, so the government only has to prove by a "preponderance of the evidence" standard. 

And that's after they've taken your stuff, you've had to post a bond, hire a lawyer, and fight against the resources of the government. One guy who ran a charter airline service once had as a passenger a suspected drug money courier.  The feds took the money and the plane that was his livelihood. The drug people took it as a regular business loss and forgot about the cash. The pilot fought against the government for years, and eventually found it cheaper just to buy his plane back at auction. BfC could have been really good, but all of the lies, misrepresentations, and inaccuracies kind of screwed it up. &gt; if he'd simply taken the money he inherited from his father and invested it in a standard fund, he'd be a lot richer today

If he had zero living expenses, invested, and pulled out before various crashes and reinvested after, then yes. At the worst of his bankruptcy around 1990 he was limited to $50,000 a month living expenses (around $90,000 today). The way he's lived would have drained the capital quickly. Only is business acumen has allowed him to keep growing his fortune.&gt;Well one is a lot tastier

Grasshoppers are tastier than a lot of plants. Lobsters are even more tasty, and they don't really even have a brain. They react to stimuli, just like plants do, no more. My problem is that there is way too much advance strategy, matching plays against, plays, etc., done by various non-playing strategists long before the game. The QB will have studied this and basically built a book of offensive plays in response to defenses. He also has a helmet radio to the sidelines, who has communications with the offensive strategist up in the press booth with a birdseye view, all to ensure he makes the right plays. At actual play time, which only lasts a few seconds at a time, there is some room for the QB to show his talent, but this is limited in both options and time. After the play, we go back to the strategists again. The QB also only has to know one thing: offense. When the other side gets the ball he goes off the field. 

Compare to a sport like soccer, where you have a constant fluid action with the players having to respond to the opposition's constantly-changing plays on the field over tens of minutes, all on their own. The same team has to play both offense and defense constantly, and can find themselves flipping between the two a few times a minute.

We have a small minority that will call for it to be illegal, and we certainly don't want to import any more of that type into the country. True, but here the government gets to take the money first and put up roadblocks to you getting it back. They have it set up so that most honest people will just give up. 

Another case was of a small landscaper who liked to buy cash from a source in another state. He landed with about $8,000 on him. They took the money, and that was it. It would cost him much more than $8,000 to get it back, so fighting was useless.Supposedly liberal Democrats created the sentencing disparity in the first place. People think the Kochs are puppeteers, but they've got nothing on this guy. I'm okay with no net increase in revenue. What we take in gets spent on renewables. I can't tell whether you're sarcastic or not. I know my wife will be pissed if Clinton wins. The problem is that for those things that work well over there to work well over here, we have to be Denmark. It all exists as a whole system. You vastly overestimate the amount of firearms training the average military person gets. Most concealed carriers practice a lot more than the official training a military person gets, which is usually only a couple trips to the range each year. 

The problem in this article is that he wants the military to select a sidearm not solely on the basis of which one's best, but on the basis of which company plays ball with his anti-gun agenda. It's just another attempt to backdoor what Congress would otherwise vote down if he introduced it as a bill.People in Florida are concentrating on Stand Your Ground, but they should be looking at this. I'm still for something like the German system: Free college for people who are academically gifted and free trade school for people who aren't (or just want a trade instead). However, we'd need to overhaul our secondary education system before we could start something like this, and it would piss off both the right and the left. We have to tell the right that their for-profit colleges don't cut it, and we have to tell the left that no, not everybody gets to go to college in a merit-based system. No, we don't care that you came from a "disadvantaged household," you don't score well enough, so you go to trade school. I'm sure those people exist. I also knew soldiers who shot their pistols once every year, barely hitting half of the 30 targets.Ah, the brown ring of quality.He was one of the top neurosurgeons in the world solely due to his extraordinary abilities. That doesn't mean he's not a kook otherwise, but there is more than enough legitimate reason to want him on boards. Semi-plausible deniability. It's still bang bang, just not as loud. Technically a suppressor, but the inventor called it a silencer.Everytown wants to recruit you as their firearms expert. It's been zero for decades in the whole country. Among legally registered automatic weapons, we're at 2 in over 80 years. They prefer mass burnings now. Yep, and neither of them actually used the advantages of full-auto. In both cases it was just one guy shooting one other guy, could have used a pistol. 

Edit: This is why the whole .50 BMG demonizing also annoys me. While they have been used in few crimes by now, can anyone show where one .50 BMG has been used where no lesser rifle would have sufficed? They may say something like "Cop was shot through his car door at 300 yards and it killed him," but most regular hunting rifle rounds can do that. It's not a logical reason to single-out the .50 BMG for a ban. It can eat into a candidate's speaking time. She saw a gun and it hurt her feelings. Author should have said homicides. &gt; I'd like to point out that Communists and Capital-S Socialists generally like their guns. 

In theory you would think that, with the whole "power to the people" thing, but in practice they tend to restrict gun possession among the workers when they control a country. If you need moar powr from a .30-06 or .270 on occasion, you can do hot handloads (still within spec though, just the higher end of it). Get a longer barrel to make use of the hot loads, and you'll be getting close to 300 Win Mag velocities. Otherwise, you get the lower recoil and expense of a ubiquitous round. The Cuban constitution says they have the right to struggle, in the context of fighting against anyone who would overthrow Castro. But after the revolution, Castro began a program of confiscation, saying the people [have no more need for arms](http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1959/19590109.html) because now they have a government of the people that works for them. 

In the Soviet Union guns were [severely restricted from the beginning](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fguner.ru%2Frazreshitelnaya-sistema-v-rossii%2F). There was push back from the peasants who needed them for subsistence hunting, but then we know they didn't give a damn about the peasants. 

Your own link to Vietnam shows civilian ownership being severely restricted.They did it. It's the .416 Barrett, a .50 case slightly shortened, necked down to a .416 bullet. It's said to have better ballistics at ranges over 1,000 yards than the .50 BMG. Arguably, the move to ban the .50 resulted in a more dangerous round. I think the cop one was killing some informant, and the other was some Asian guy who went nuts and shot someone. Her conviction that she deserves to be president for 8 years after Obama stole it from her. But Obama was graceful, hiring her as Secretary of State so she could stay in the limelight coming up to her next chance. You can't know whether that guy controlling 6,000 pounds of car four feet from you at 45 mph will flick the wheel and splatter you all over the pavement. Yet we don't call the police about the regular traffic either. 

Now, someone walking with a gun and acting suspiciously, I'd report too. The problem is that the anti-gun people have flooded 9/11 with calls about people just because they are armed. They are doing this on purpose just to harass carriers, and some have even said they hope their calls will get the carriers shot by the police. It's hard for the police to tell who's crying wolf in this situation. The anti-gunners have definitely hurt public safety with their antics. Well, they lied to the regulators. The people were just looking at those awesome mpg numbers, and a VW diesel usually delivers better than what's listed. True, it was a crash rendered non-deadly by the parachute system. Yeah all you avid archers, you get to feel the pain of this PC no-tolerance crap too now. PC will never run out of people to demonize, because they'll just make up more as needed.If two people sincerely want to solve their differences according to their religious principles, that's their business. I see no reason to get involved. Where I disagree here is that should one party desire access to our secular court system, it should be public policy that it be allowed regardless of any previous agreement. Okay, a bit smaller bang bang. &gt;If you're not sure if there's a legitimate threat, you can report it. 

That's not what the movement wants. They say to call the second you see a gun, regardless of the actions or attitudes of the carrier. He could be just eating his sandwich in a booth, minding his own business, and they will call.  They say to do this in order to harass carriers, and hopefully to get them shot by the police in some warped sense of justice they have. The operator has probably heard this cry wolf a thousand times.

The equivalent is calling the cops about a maniac driver whenever you see someone calmly and legally driving down the street. Take this back some decades, and it would be like racists calling the police about a black man molesting a white woman whenever they saw an interracial couple. You have a legal act that some people don't like, so they want to SWAT them in revenge. It never gets down to that near-silent movie/video game sound. Evil Kochs, must be trying to hire henchmen for their empire. /sIt's not counted unless it's fired, hits the assailant, and kills the assailant. Otherwise, it wasn't a defensive gun use even if it saved your life.If I leave a large tip my credit card company will send me a text.

Yes, it'll probably be the most fraud-free restaurant in town for at least a year. The punishment in the Quran for sex outside marriage is 100 lashes. so you are correct in that the Quran doesn't command this punishment. But the Quran doesn't forbid it either. Almost all Muslims accept Hadith as authoritative, and according to Sahih Muslim 17:4192, a married adulterer is to receive 100 lashes and then be stoned to death. This is the second most authoritative Hadith next to al-Bukhari for Sunnis, and they consider it 100% authoritative. 

TL;DR: Confining the defense to the Quran is a bit disingenuous when Hadith has authority too. They already did.That's some pretty twisted logic there. The bulk of Islamic jurisprudence throughout the ages disagrees with the author. 

Edit: Quran-only Muslims are a tiny mority, generally considered apostates by the larger Muslim community. It would be nice if Islam had a reformation, moving the bulk of adherents into the modern age. I actually like these nicer, more modern interpretations, but it's simply not what's believed by most Muslims. I want. It's a great little gun. The only problem you might have is that if it doesn't extract/eject right, you might need a little file work on the extractor. G19 disadvantage: It's a Glock brand Glock

Sig master race forever! You're golden then, have fun with a great rifle!Calling for "assault weapons" bans and such while mentioning the 90 number is completely dishonest, purposely misleading the viewers.Her platform includes such bans. Their use, as little as it is, is solely related to crime, not suicide. Unless you think a 30-round magazine aids in suicide, it's dishonest.The majority of people who know what they're talking about, or the majority of people who are completely clueless? The majority of people think we should have a law banning the practice of a person going to another state to buy handguns from a dealer for the purpose of reselling the guns in his home state to known criminals. The problem is, what I just described already breaks four federal laws, but the people filling out surveys don't know that.The protection was passed because there was a concerted effort among anti-gun groups, and deep-pocketed city and state politicians to bankrupt gun manufacturers and dealers through frivolous lawsuits. New York AG Eliot Spitzer literally threatened to bankrupt Glock through lawsuits. Charter Arms specifically cited lawsuit defense in its bankruptcy.  Other types of business didn't need this type of protection because they weren't being attacked like this. This law narrowly remedies a specific abuse of the court system to destroy an industry, nothing more. They voted no on monopolization of legal marijuana. Minus the monopolization, it might have passed. You should care if you worry about your government lying to you. Countries have strange ways of doing welfare. In Japan they have long retail pipelines stocked with many unnecessary workers. It results in higher prices at retail, but it provides jobs for those people. Here we charge $5 for a cotton swab, and for those people who actually pay it (most don't), their money goes to pay for the free medical services the hospital provides to the poor. The inflated price also lets the hospitals charge more off on their taxes for the services they perform to the poor. &gt; Every public policy issue has uninformed on both sides of the argument, most people have a very simple understanding or an emotional reaction to the issue of gun policy.

Most people on the anti-gun side know very little about current gun laws, and even less about guns. Even the politicians writing the laws often have no idea what they're talking about. One congresswoman thought that a "high-capacity" magazine ban would be effective because once the bullets are shot out of the existing magazines they can't be used anymore, so there would eventually be none left. This is a lack of knowledge at a very fundamental level, like thinking you can't refill a car's gas tank.

&gt;there is a clear connection between the ease of gun access in the United States and gun homicide.

Homicide has been going down while record number of guns are being sold, and many states have liberalized their gun laws. The True outrage is that she lied to us to help Obama get reelected. &gt;but in comparison to other developed stable countries that have more gun control it is much higher.

Crime increased in the UK, even counting their habit of not reporting crimes to make the police look good. It's still decreasing in the US. Switzerland has lots of guns, and their crime rate is also decreasing. There's really no correlation between stricter gun laws and lower crime. TL;DR: He was really damn good at his job. That's a completely unbalanced membership. They might as well have created a task force to address racial injustices and staffed it with KKK members. Was it originally written like that by advocates, or was the provision a poison pill?That's the second time Bloomberg's failed to buy an election. &gt;The dispatcher was so worried about infringing on someones second amendment rights

Well, normally you don't send the police upon notification of a person engaging in a legal activity. However, as to claims he was acting strange, the dispatcher was probably used to anti-gun people crying wolf on open carriers in accordance with their stated program to do so.

&gt;Open carry attempts to normalize behavior that should set off alarms in any sane society.

Open carry used to be the norm, and it was concealed carry that was considered strange behavior among polite society. Back then, we didn't have so much hoplophobia, and people didn't freak out at the sight of a gun. I need my dishwasher fixed.&gt;Gun rights groups aren't interested in compromise.

Compromise means give and take on both sides. What have you offered to give in exchange for what you want to take? If you haven't offered to give, then it is you who aren't interested in compromise. 

Remember, we are starting from a position where your side has already taken a lot over the last 80 years. You need to start giving back before we'll even think about letting you take even more. There is a witch hunt aspect to it, especially since the attack itself shouldn't be a scandal given we've had our interests all over the world attacked since at least the 1970s. It would be better if they targeted the use of her office to provide political advantage to the president in an election by lying to the people. I'd say at least up until the 1900s. Some state constitutions even have in them protection for the right to carry arms, but allow concealed carry to be prohibited by the legislature. Back then a gentleman carried openly. You couldn't be up to no good if you displayed your weapon openly. A person would only conceal because he didn't want others to know he had a gun, and that could only be for nefarious purposes. It's interesting how perceptions change.This is what the anti-gun groups are pushing. They're even hoping to get an open carrier shot by the police some day. I generally don't take ancient religious verbal histories at face value: deeds are exaggerated, and numbers are vastly inflated. However, the Egyptian empire of the supposed time of the Exodus did cover some of what is modern-day Israel. To escape the Egyptians, the Jews didn't ever need to be in modern-day Egypt. &gt;you get to cloak any reasonable discussion about guns in America

You can't just call something "reasonable" and make it be so. Most discussions by anti-gun people are not reasonable. For example, earlier you targeted a type of very popular sporting rifle that's used in a extremely tiny percentage of crimes, and you targeted "high-capacity" magazines (i.e., normal capacity magazines) while almost all murders are committed with under ten rounds. Limits on these are not in any way reasonable because their effect on crime would be negligible (the FBI concludes no positive effect due to the 1990s "assault weapon" ban), while their affect on the law-abiding would be wide spread. 

&gt;What have gun-control advocates "taken away?"

We started with people being able to own anything we want. That's the default, that's how it was. Yes, people could even own cannons, the most powerful weapon of the time. Then over the years you have taken: restricting suppressors, restricting short barreled rifles and shotguns, restricting automatics and outlawing new ones, requiring a background check, requiring serial numbers, armor piercing bullet bans, licensing manufacturers and dealers, caliber restrictions, restricting interstate sales, restricting imports, restricting inexpensive guns, age restrictions, restricting who can own guns, and more. And that's just federal, there are many more restrictions at the state and local level. 

Now that you've taken all that, if you want more, YOU need to compromise. Simply demanding more restrictions is not compromise, so you don't get to claim we are the ones who will not compromise.

&gt;No, there's nothing left for the Left to give you. You've already won.

Rights advocates are starting from a position of being way behind given what you've taken as shown above, so you have plenty to give. Remove suppressors and short-barreled rifles/shotguns from the NFA and open the automatic registry again. Remove the sporting restrictions on imported guns. You give that back, and I might be amenable to listening to talk of new restrictions, but only if such restrictions would pass the strict scrutiny judicial test for rights (I might be convinced of heightened scrutiny). This is called compromise.

Well, there is one thing we'd like you to give that isn't simply returning what you've taken. Enact national concealed carry reciprocity with requirements set at an average of what the states currently do. If you want compromise, put that on the table. Right now a person traveling concealed needs a modern version of the Green Book that segregation-era black travelers needed to keep from running afoul of the various the Jim Crow laws. 

&gt;Your right to own a gun is safe.

It is safe despite people like you. The only reason it is safe for now is due to the efforts millions of pro-rights people working in their representative democracy. The last two guns I saw in public on civilians were a short chunky black lady carrying pizza with a beautiful 1911 holstered, and a young black man waiting in line at a small restaurant with a Glock holstered while reading something on his phone. The actions of neither gave me any rational reason to be scared. The stated intent was to terrorize and harass carriers, and hopefully get some of them shot by the police. Certain towns out West did that. It was never challenged in court though, and residents of the town could have their guns. Back then, restrictions that were upheld were normally only upheld where they were designed to restrict blacks. Maybe if we didn't have so many people crying wolf to harass law-abiding people, the police might have responded faster. &gt;But other people have the right to feel safe and comfortable in their own neighborhood.

Then your neighbor carrying should help you feel safe and comfortable. I'm not exactly a fan of open carry either, but then my preferences shouldn't dictate the rights of others. [Colonial gun laws](http://www.saf.org/journal/16/ColonialFirearmRegulation.pdf) (PDF)You could buy a Thompson by mail order.It's called studying.&gt;You still haven't said why we should loosen those laws

First, that's irrelevant to my point. You've taken. If you want compromise, you need to give back, you know, actually compromise. Demanding that we submit further is not compromise. You don't get to say we won't compromise when you are the one refusing to compromise.

You haven't said why we should keep these laws. Suppressors are safety equipment that also reduces the noise nuisance from legal shooting where applicable, so should be widely available on the shelves, not restricted. Short-barreled rifles aren't especially useful for crime, while their size makes them more useful for home defense. Nothing prevents a criminal from sawing-off a shotgun for illegal concealment, while a law-abiding person can't legally do the same to make use in hallways for home defense easier. There have been exactly two crimes with legal automatics in 80 years with over 100,000 in public hands, and both of those were one-on-one simple shootings (one by a cop), so there is no public safety reason to prohibit new ones. 

In the interest of compromise, I am willing to concede certain restrictions should remain, such as licensing of dealers and manufacturers, requiring serial numbers, a handgun purchase age limit, registration of automatics, prohibition for violent felons, the illegality of straw purchases, restricting interstate sales, and even background checks (mandatory from dealers, voluntary and free for private sales). There's compromise for you. Now you do your part and give back.

Obama was talking about making a more solid definition of what defines a dealer instead of just a private seller. If it's set at a rational level not designed to restrict private sales overall, just to catch people trying to skirt the licensing requirement, then I'm all for it. There's compromise for you. Now you do your part and give back.

I'll go even further. Right now if a dealer is shut down because of illegal activity, he can just have a family member get a license and run the store under that license. The store can continue to run, nothing actually changed. I'd be amenable to a change in law that cracked down on this practice too. There's compromise for you. Now you do your part and give back.

I'll even go for losing the right for the duration of a violence-related restraining order, as long as there are due process protections and harsh mandatory punishment for False claims. There's compromise for you. Now you do your part and give back.

&gt;If you want those laws changed just so you can come home from the gun store with more interesting toys, or you can stock your panic room with something belt-fed, that's not really a well-reasoned trade.

I actually don't like automatics, the smoke makes me gag. And since the war I tend to flinch when hearing them up close. But what I like isn't the issue here. It's people being able to exercise their rights. You don't have to be gay to support gay rights either. 

&gt;Like you were wronged decades ago and you'll do whatever it takes to extort a change in the laws just for your own peace of mind.

That's kind of how pro-rights movements work. Blacks and their supporters worked very hard to remove decades-old restrictions on their rights, and gays and gun owners (sometimes as the same people) have been doing the same. 

&gt;when the NRA and its supporters are so clearly not interested in helping us curb violence overall

The NRA doesn't support your proposals that won't do much for violence, but will have the main effect of restricting law-abiding people. While your side has just been trying to expand a flawed background check system fed with incomplete and erroneous data in order to suppress lawful gun ownership, the NRA has been working to ensure the current system is fed with timely, accurate and comprehensive data so that checks are quickly denied on solid grounds. With what the NRA has been working to put in place, the Charleston shooter would have been denied a gun from the dealer. 

The NRA has also suggested better enforcement of current laws, which is a proven way to reduce violence. Right now 70,000 background checks per year are rejected, tens of thousands for good reason. That means tens of thousands of people perjured themselves on the background check form in order to obtain a firearm. We are sitting on prima facie evidence of mass perjury to obtain a firearm, yet we prosecute fewer than 100 cases per year. The ATF can inspect gun stores once per year for no reason, and as much as they want with reason, but has left gun stores widely known to sell to straw buyers uninspected for years while trying to shut down others for having a small rate of paperwork errors, no straw buying even alleged. One lady had a manufacturing company that had a license to make gun parts in case they ever got such an order. As soon as she joined a conservative cause, the ATF inspected her business, even though she'd never actually manufactured firearms. 

The NRA is working to make us safer while you just want feel-good laws that won't actually help anything. 

&gt;Do you not see how that looks contradictory to an outside observer?

We have more guns than ever in this country, and our crime rate still goes down. So, no, it is not contradictory. 

&gt;The way it's been described here, your definition of compromise is akin to a bank robber 

My definition of compromise is the actual definition: 

&gt;a settlement of differences by mutual concessions; an agreement reached by adjustment of conflicting or opposing claims, principles, etc., by reciprocal modification of demands. 

You will not make concessions, you will not modify your demands. You simply want.I'm trying to remember the state, but once a state court did allow a law prohibiting the carrying of weapons, but the law only prohibited blacks, so the court upheld the law on the grounds that they were not citizens and therefore did not have the right. Conversely, this means the court did believe white people had the right and could not be prohibited.Ooh, we can go on "design"? Great. Most rifles and shotguns, and some pistols, are designed to hunt, not kill people. Many pistols and most of the rest of the rifles are designed for target shooting, not to kill people. A huge number of those scary black ARs on the market are designed for competition and target shooting, not to kill people. And the rest, especially handguns? They're only designed to kill you in self defense if you are threatening the life of another, which is not murder. Those designed for the military were designed to legally kill opposing forces. 

TL;DR: No gun is designed to "murder" you. I read the same Yale article before. Notice it mentions few restrictions on open carry. Back then, nobody was going to call the constable because someone was buying supplies with a musket on his back. They'd just assume he had it to keep safe during his travels. Lots.You actually have movement leaders promoting this, and the members saying that's their policy for whenever they see a gun. The cops aren't scared, the sheeple are. &gt;When cops are trained to shoot first before trying to de-escalat

This is what the anti-gun people are relying on when they call the cops on a legal open carrier. They want one to get shot to discourage anyone else. &gt;Along with the Mayor, Bratton expressed frustration at how guns from other states with less strict laws continually make it into the hands of New Yorkers, hence their call for federal reform. 

The practice of going to another state to buy pistols, then returning to your state to sell those pistols to criminals, already violates at least four distinct federal firearms laws: purchasing in another state without going through a home-state FFL, straw purchase (perjury on the 4473), dealing firearms without a license, and selling to people who the seller knows or should know are prohibited.

They broke at least four federal laws, and the solution is "We need more laws!"Hopefully not, but in another way. Hopefully the Democrats abandon the gun control platform, pulling the rug out from under Bloomberg and getting them a LOT more votes. There are a huge number of people would vote Democrat more often if not for their stance on this issue. &gt;Is this really something "so many people" are doing or not?

It's been happening, so I'd say yes. They were calling on the Texas open carry protesters constantly. They've even exaggerated. One guy who had just visited a 7/11 was pulled over after the caller said he had threatened people with his gun. Just like right-wing whackos cornered certain anti-rights policies in the Republican party, the Democrats have their own wing too. Party politics just sucks. Or you could provide a source proving your assertion that gun carrying was commonly forbidden while concealed carry was favored. I own lots, rifles, pistols, revolvers, couple shoguns, some inherited due to a shooting heritage in my family, most purchased. All are locked up if not on me, a few pistols in a small quick-access safe. I technically live in a city, but the area is still semi-country, lots of wildlife, including the odd coyote.

I could keep in a vehicle, but prefer not to, too many car break-ins around here. I don't like what the anti-gun people call "assault weapons" much, so I mainly have wood-stocked rifles ranging from .22 to large caliber, many quite old. They are all a combination of collection, teaching kids how to shoot, target practice (it's a really calming zen thing), and hunting. Plus refinishing trashed stocks and rehabilitating old actions is fun (no guys, nothing with serious collector value where you want to keep the patina). 

A few of the pistols have an added defense purpose for me and the wife. There are known drug dealers around here with the inherent criminal activity, and there have been several bad dog maulings, almost including me. The old .410 shotgun is good for the occasional water moccasin (venomous) and possum (rabies danger).

Only one of my guns would fall under an "assault weapon" or "high-capacity magazine" ban, and that's a 40 year-old wood-stocked .22 rifle with a tube magazine that I learned to shoot with as a kid. It holds a few too many bullets for New Jersey's ban.A pair of $100+ UK-made Docs will last me years, but the $40 shoes at the average retailer last maybe a few months. Do we say rope violence for hangings? Chemical violence for poisonings? Nope? Then it's not gun violence when it comes to guns.A trade group that tracks who's buying it's goods as any industry would. Women and minorities are the fastest-growing gun buying demographics. &gt;You mean they were calling in on the people who were doing their damnedest to scare the shit out of people?

They were trying to raise awareness for their cause. They were political protests. Gay pride parades scare the shit out of conservative Christians, doesn't mean the police should be called.

&gt;In the absence of the caller admitting they called in on "the guy" because they wanted to harrass open carriers, is this actually relevant?

Yes.[Here](http://volokh.com/posts/1228953400.shtml) is just one example. Knowledge of past societies is called learning history. It is a common and helpful practice.They follow you. Look what's happened to Colorado after too many Californians came. I believe it's "fucktard," one word.I think Texas has succeeded.

I take it you are not familiar enough with the concept of blogs to recognize the postings of others in response to the author, separate from the posts of the author himself. 

You asked for source, I gave you a famous law professor who specializes in gun-related subjects like this. Is it a modern political version of the Energy Rapper?Damn, that's actually pretty good. Looks like you just want to keep little fingers away, so a simple locking cabinet would even suffice as others have said. For next to the bed, there are lots of small safes available. Keypad is quick, and those fingerprint-reading safes look tempting. But be careful, readers vary widely in quality. Most aren't as good as the one on the iPhone. Too high of a False positive rate, your kids can open it. Too high of a False negative rate, you can't open it in an emergency.

You'll be in target heaven if you can find a used Anschutz within your budget. Speaking of used, old Remington 514s are excellent single-shot bolt-actions too, and can be found pretty cheap.

Or, here's a strange one for you, the Springfield Model 87A, made by other companies such as Stevens too. It's a semi-auto, tube magazine. However, the charging handle doubles as a bolt lock, allowing it to be effectively a bolt action. It can also shoot .22 Short since it won't need to cycle the action. &gt;I'll go about my day, and you can continue reading reading blogs about what people in the 1800's considered "normal", written by people who also weren't born in that century. 

I hope you realize that people back then were capable of this thing called writing. This amazing invention, which actually existed before the Internet, allowed them to leave information for future generations, enabling us to learn what they considered "normal." 

So go ahead, stay uninformed in your anti-gun bubble, while I read articles by respected professors who concentrate on this subject. "Iron ass," I love it. 

I'm starting to think that the only highly-positioned person in that administration with any ethics was John Ashcroft.&gt;Many incidents are accidents. Many are committed by children who happen upon guns in their/their neighbors'/their relatives' houses.

These are actually pretty rare. Yes, "many" as in you can't count them on both hands, but not "many" as in any significant portion of gun deaths. 

&gt;So while it's easy to put the blame for gun violence on the mentally ill -- or the lack of support for them -- it's misleading

She is correct. There are many causes: mental illness, the drug war, crime in general, poverty, decline of the family, etc. Each requires a different solution. However, mental illness is normally spoken of in relation to the hyped-up mass shootings, not the general crime that constitutes most of the shootings.

&gt;For one thing, manufacturers should be required by law to use available safety technology to prevent accidental deaths.

There is no such reliable technology available. She's been watching too much Judge Dredd.

&gt;For another, there should be increased funding for medical research on guns, an area of research where there is very little funding at all.

This is incorrect. She just referenced a recent Bloomberg-funded study. Anti-gun groups like Bloomberg's and the Joyce Foundation have poured tens of millions of dollars into the creation of pay-for-results anti-gun studies.



This is what defines the anti-gun movement. They have a religious conviction that cannot be swayed by facts or logic. I don't want your religion governing my freedom any more than I want Pat Robertson's. Now this is the kind of refugee I can get behind. They're not emigrating just because they don't like the general conditions in their country. Those people should wait in line for regular immigration. These people are fleeing because they are specifically targeted for persecution by their home countries. Welcome!Don't think you're doing anything wrong. Everybody grieves in his own way, heals at his own pace. Guilt though? Just remember, this isn't the worst thing that could have happened from your dad's point of view. You dying before him is.

My mom died unexpectedly in my 30s, and it hurt bad too. Years later it still feels like she's here sometimes, little flashes of denial. I still reach for the phone to call her sometimes, hey your granddaughter hit such-and-such milestone in her life. You're never really ready for it unless they're quite old and it just feels like the natural end to a good life. That's what happened to my grandpa.Sometimes they actually are out to get you.Be nice, some go native. The one who just wants to spends his days trout fishing isn't the one you're worried about.  It's the ones who want to bring their crap with them that you have to watch out for. Firing the Springfield semi-auto is the strangest thing. It locks the bolt to the back when firing, only releasing it when you release the trigger. So firing semi-auto is kind of a "click-clack" thing. For bolt action, instead of "lift up, pull back, push forward, push down" as is common, it's "pull out sideways, pull back, let go to spring forward (or ride it in for push forward), push in sideways." &gt; You can hear the voices plotting against you, can't you? 

Not just hear, but I can see them too! Whenever I turn on the news they're right there saying we need to restrict guns more. It's a special type of paranoia based on what the anti-gun people actually say and do. This sums it up, "I do not personally have any objections to having a gun that only operates when the owner fires it, ... But that is kind of like saying I would prefer flying my car to work." I'm going to use that. Yes, blatant theft.Republicans aren't trying to overturn that. They're trying to overturn the EPA's expansion of those rules to include tiny seasonal streams and stock ponds. In one famous case a rancher damned up a small seasonal stream to make a stock pond, over 100 miles away from the nearest EPA-regulated waterway. He got all the state permits and inspections, and the pond even became a haven for local wildlife. The EPA claimed dominion and told him to get rid of it because of "pollution."Ignorance is the answer! Sounds familiar...

It'll be interesting when Everytown for Gun Safety actually supports educating people about gun safety. It's right there in the name guys.We know what Egyptian granaries looked like. Hint: Not giant pyramid shapes with just a few small chambers and no easy access. Carriers are good for projection of power, intimidation. If things get heated in the South China Sea due to China's illegal territorial claim, a carrier parked there is what says we mean business. True, in actual war with a large power, carriers are very vulnerable. It's all the subs that are a real danger, but a big cigar 300 feet under the water just isn't as intimidating. &gt;Car chases and crashes are also often dubbed over with sound effects for TV and movies...

I love seeing a car coming to a stop quickly without any wheel lockup, yet there's that long screech. This is especially funny with newer cars, which all have ABS, so even at full brake slam you'd at most hear little chirps. You just gave me an idea.

&gt;The example you give sounds egregious but stock ponds can be significant sources of pollution in a watershed. 

The claimed pollution was particulates in the navigable waters the EPA has control over. This stream eventually fed a tributary, which fed navigable waters over 100 miles away. Even then the particulates are fewer since they settle in the pond. 

The issue of regulatory overreach is the even bigger issue. &gt; I'm worried about gun fetishists with paranoid delusions having psychotic breaks and mowing down random strangers in public

Usually it's the anti-gun people who have murderous fantasies. 

&gt;I guess what I\u2019ll do if I\u2019m ever in that situation and I see one of these half-witted yahoos walking in with a weapon, high-caliber rifle like that, I\u2019ll just put on a berserk act. I will just start screaming Gun! Gun! Gun! Watch out, everybody hit the deck! Guns! Guns! Everybody! And then dial 911 and I will say, shots fired, which will bring every g**-damned cop within 15 miles. And then the half-wits with the long guns are going to panic and they\u2019re going to run out of the store and if that rifle isn\u2019t shouldered properly, the cop is going to take a look at that and put a bullet right in their forehead.

Famous liberal radio show host Mike Malloy.

&gt;One of these things seems to happen with far more regularity than the other...

I definitely agree. They anti-gun people attempt to infringe on rights far more often. Hardly a day goes by where they don't promote rights infringement.  Powell was complicit in the WMD claims. Try to get the EPA to approve the reversal of a river when they're trying to stamp out stock ponds on tiny streams 100 miles away from any navigable water. Or so we are told, about the guy who helped whitewash they My Lai massacre. Or so we are told, about the guy who helped whitewash they My Lai massacre. If it doesn't suppress or deter lawful ownership, they don't want it. I can see pursuing it from a technical standpoint. Who knows, maybe one day there will be a good system available. When the police and military start buying it purely on the basis of the benefit it provides, then it's probably worth looking at. &gt;The PLO said the hearing failed to mention "recent acts of Israeli incitement,"

Yes, the Israelis are forcing you to kill their civilians. The problem is that "incitement" for most Palestinians includes "claiming the right of the Jewish state of Israel to exist." For some, the mere presence of Jews is incitement enough. &gt;and failing to register a firearm after buying an illegal sawed-off shotgun for $720 from an undercover FBI agent

I wonder if this was the same entrapment they used to go after Randy Weaver. But at least this time they didn't decide to murder his family.I just urged mine to support the bill. Let's see what happens. He's a Democrat, but not one of the whacko wing ones. Our cruisers and destroyers have launch systems for missiles right now that would probably fit a pretty decent rocket-boosted drone. Recovery and reloading would be interesting though, but could probably be worked out. 

Edit: Again though, we have that psychological aspect. We all know carriers are sitting ducks in war. But nothing produces the psychological "oh shit" like a carrier floating just outside your national waters. No matter what we actually replace them with, it won't likely come with the psychological impact. Right now we can park a few destroyers and subs off a coast and have hundreds of Tomahawks in the air in minutes, but they're just not one of those big-ass scary carriers. He would have also admitted not being American, so it couldn't be treason. He can't do that, but it is fully within his power to unilaterally pardon every single federal drug convict in the country. Actually, if I were president I'd pardon all non-violent drug offenders on day one, and as any new ones were convicted they'd get pardons too. Yes, I know if I were president it would be purely one term, because I'd piss off far too many powerful people to get reelected. I'd be afraid of the prison industry having me assassinated. You must have loved that Gulf War Show they broadcast for a few months back in the early 90s. People must have been pissed when CNN canceled it. He was awesome in Galaxy Quest, deadpan at its hilarious finest! Time Allen was funny, but he and Tony Shalhoub really made that movie. I loved him in Dogma too, "You people. If there isn't a movie about it, it's not worth knowing, right?"Siouxsie Sioux, from Siouxsie and the Banshees. She was doing the really bitchy diva thing, but Budgie was awesome. Sometimes I wonder if Billy Bob Thornton's "there be dragons" speech to that cop who pulled him over in the first episode of Fargo would really work. 

&gt;Well, we could do it that way. You ask me for my papers and I tell you it\u2019s not my car.  That I borrowed 
it.  And see where things go from there.  We could do that.  Or, you could just get back in your car and 
drive away. ... Because some roads you shouldn\u2019t go down.  Because maps used to say there be dragons here. And now they don\u2019t.  But that don\u2019t mean the dragons aren\u2019t there. ... I'm gonna roll my window up, then I'm going to drive away and you're gonna go home to your daughter. And every few years you're gonna look at her face and know that you're alive because you chose not to go down on a certain road on a certain night. That you chose to walk into the light instead of into the darkness. &gt;I remember sitting up late at night listening to bbc radio during gulf war 

So did I, while I was in the Gulf War. Nobody told us shit of course, so we found out the larger picture by listening to BBC Worldwide on medium-wave. Remember, no one wants to take your guns. That's just paranoia.&gt;all law-abiding undocumented Americans

That's an inherently contradictory sentence.Me too, which made it all the worse.That won't be the end result, so it would be bad to take mine.For the money, Sturdy brand safes, less frill more security. AMSEC BF series more frills, less security. 

[Read every page of this article](http://gunsafereviewsguy.com/articles/myths-about-gun-safe-theft-protection/) and then stay away from the normal big box store safes if security is your goal. I think one of the scariest things was seeing those really big shiny locking bolts ending in thin stamped steel as soon as they get behind the door where you can't see. Then you see the Sturdy, nice long locking bolts running through a strong support structure. They're much more secure, but they're thinner, so the sales floor "wow" factor isn't there.

Seriously, these days the gun safe market is full of snake oil. &gt;It is the result of minor parties failing to run candidates that people want to vote for.

And voting laws designed to ensure other parties don't succeed. We have a voting method which creates the spoiler problem, and the election laws of the states are geared towards a high hurdle for other parties, while giving the two main parties a pass. Because of the timing of the Republican convention, Bush was not eligible to run in one state, but they just changed it so he could. Meanwhile, the parties running the states do everything they can to keep the third parties off the ballots. &gt;All of those pictures on the Liberty website of their safes out in the open like another piece of furniture

They sure do look pretty and impressive for the friends though, don't they? Running when the law prevents you from getting on the ballot is even harder. A third-party candidate needs about 35,000 signatures to run for Congress in Georgia, while Democrats and Republicans need none. Even if they were gathered, they would be challenged line-by-line by the incumbent parties, so it would be safer to gather over 50,000 signatures. A third-party candidate would need a very large amount of money and massive organization to even get on the ballot, while a Republican or Democrat gets on the ballot automatically. Because of this law, they haven't had a third party on the congressional ballot in 70 years.

In Tennessee, a third party candidate needs 40,000 signatures just to get on the ballot, where a Democrat or Republican needs only 25. Without buying much new. There is a huge list of exceptions. I'm pointing out that the Republican and Democrat candidates don't even need to attract that support. As long as their party blesses them, they're automatically on the ballot. Meanwhile, other candidates have high hurdles to overcome to even get on the ballot before they can even start trying to convince enough people to vote for them to win the election. &gt;Mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes.

I thought we were against mandatory minimums now due to the injustices that have resulted.

&gt;Mandatory background checks for all gun sales

Except for the criminal-to-criminal sales that are already illegal, of course.

&gt;Federal laws that make it harder for guns that are bought in Indiana and Mississippi to make their way into Chicago.

This interstate trafficking of handguns already constitutes at least four federal crimes. Shall we make it more illegaler?&gt;I'm pointing out minor parties do an awful job of attracting support. 

Because people know the laws are so stacked against them that they have no chance, and because of our spoiler voting system.You are entirely missing the point here. Criminal-to-criminal sales are covered for felony crimes already on the books that we can prosecute for. At best, failure to do mandatory background checks are an add-on charge for them, which is not really a deterrent. The main effect is to burden, inconvenience, and entrap otherwise law-abiding people. 

Seriously, do you think that a girl who just bought a pistol for her gang banger boyfriend is going to do a background check before handing it over to him? She just willingly committed two federal felonies, and you think she cares about that?Bill Murray. I love Bill, but his wonderful irreverence would destroy the seriousness of the role. I've tried to watch Seinfeld, but I just don't find it very funny. A band called Ministry paused the show to complain about the security being violent towards those in the mosh pit, and bitched at the fans for hanging on stage instead of just jumping off. You can hear it on the live Power Department CD.&gt; Couldn't even understanding what he was singing but it was fun.

That sounds like when Gibby Haynes showed up to sing the Jesus Built My Hot Rod vocals for Ministry, but he was so drunk it was just unintelligible babble.Changing the laws to allow third-party access is the solution. However, that's not too likely since it's the Republicans and Democrats who make the laws. &gt;  what about the original story -- the innocent children and their fate in a society full of guns?

Following her suggestions certainly won't help.This sounds familiar. They had voter fraud a few years back to try to get more Muslims in the city government. There's also internal division, with the Arab Muslims not having been happy with Bangladeshi Muslims being elected. To think he could have just retired as a world-renowned neurosurgeon. What a way to go.Lowering overall crime through traditional means, encouraging intact families, ending the war on drugs, anti-poverty programs. A lot of the blame falls with the actions of the people themselves regardless of government policy. When 400 people witnessed a gang shooting and not one will tell the police he saw something, then they have a large part of blame for future violence.If Westmoreland offered him a spot at West Point, then he was indeed offered a full scholarship at West Point, because all admissions are under a full scholarship. Legally a spot wasn't Westmoreland's to give, but if the Chief of Staff of the US Army personally backs a candidate, then that candidate is getting into West Point. I liked "This body doesn't even have a head, but I did a facial reconstruction good enough for you to match with a 240 year-old portrait."Leave it to the Earthlings to make the ugliest fucking ships in the universe. Pretend it's a one-season miniseries, kind of like Zero Hour, which did end at the end of one season, and was therefore rather good. There's nothing to refute this. Westmoreland's people simply saying "You got it if you want it" can constitute such an offer. Are conservatives allowed to play the race card?I wonder how much water that uses.You can have my labeling gun when you pry it from my cold, dead hands.&gt;1 - IT MAKES YOU A TARGET

This is only for the magnetic/RFID ones. If they became ubiquitous, so many styles would be available, at some point nobody would notice. Imagine the RFID is in a ring base, and hundreds of after-market vendors made differently-styled rings to go over it. 

&gt;2 - YOU LEAVE A NOTICEABLE ELECTRONIC FOOTPRINT THAT ANYONE CAN ABUSE

Only for RFID. 

&gt;Criminals could scan a building and the vicinity to determine where the guns are before attacking.

RFID is too short-range to do this, usually only several feet. Of course, this means your #5 is absolutely True. The milliwatt power of RFID on a few known frequencies means a 100-foot radius jammer doesn't have to be very powerful at all, probably would fit in a pocket. Making one is basic electronics.

&gt;LE can make the case that if they can read the signal outside of your home, then clearly your gun is not in a safe

As above, he wouldn't be able to read dozens of guns from outside your house if they were sitting on the bed. 

&gt;6 - THE FALSE-ACCEPTANCE RATES ARE LARGELY UNEXPLORED 

False acceptance rates is mainly a problem of fingerprint readers. False rejection is even worse, because it keeps you from protecting yourself. My iPhone has one of the most advanced fingerprint readers in it, but a damp finger doesn't get recognized. But you are right in that the hacking potential of RFID is quite vast. Most RFID setups aren't very secure as is, allowing multiple avenues of attack. Right now you could slap a custom RFID on a truck and have a chance of compromising the company's distribution center if they use RFID. 

&gt; THE FALSE REJECTION RATES ARE TERRIFYING - You are wearing the ring/watch/whatever, but the gun fails to authorize you because:     The batteries are low     It is too hot outside

Most of these are easily fixable with a decent design. Of course, decent design isn't very likely to happen. I give a 99.99% chance of snake oil crap.

&gt;. A government solution could cover an entire city or many cities, perhaps during a civil disturbance or natural disaster or whenever Jesse Jackson decides to stir up trouble.

Most RFID proposals actually have selective government DOS built in. For example, they could issue a command to shut down all guns but the police-owned ones. 

&gt;8 - IF YOUR OFF-HAND CAN USE THE WEAPON, THEN AN ATTACKER CAN USE IT TOO

This is one of the basic facts that the RFID proponents forget when claiming it will keep your gun from being used against you. &gt;The Green Party and Libertarian Party had ballot access and write-in access in nearly 50 states and and could not come up with 1.5 million popular votes combined in 2012.

You're talking presidential ballot. I just listed congressional requirements. They often differ. Also, without the spoiler problem, the votes would have been much higher.

&gt;Do you want to change the law to outlaw stupid or make presidential elections adapt T-ball rules?

I want reasonable and equal qualifications for all parties, including the incumbents. I want elimination of first-past-the-post to stop the spoiler problem. But he's black. I'll go for that. I don't get a missile launcher, and the antis get nothing.The fact is that West Point only has scholarships. There's no other way to get in.That is the compromise. I'm just taking what Sanders proposed at face value.&gt;Thompson's granddaughter Tymiracle 

Really? At times this is borderline abuse.No, they give you a full scholarship for a four-year degree in exchange for a commitment to receive a commission (not enlistment) in the Army after graduation.If the Chief of Staff of the US Army personally wants you in West Point, you are going to get in. For all purposes, it was an offer.Thanks for the info. I was trying to figure out why the NSFW tag was on photos you can find in any hunting magazine.It's sort of quasi-military, doesn't count towards retirement. They're commissioned as second lieutenants after graduation.Can we go through Obama's memoirs and demand proof for every statement?Scholarship = paid-for degree. He was offered West Point, and as a top ROTC cadet he certainly met all other requirements, so he was offered a scholarship. From his point of view it was college he wouldn't have to pay for, which means full scholarship.If you watch it, they tell her a truck just had to stop because she was impeding traffic and didn't notice. They don't even tell her to get off the street, just walk on the other side so she can see traffic coming.Tens of thousands of people lie on the form to buy a gun every year. We have their name, address, prima facie evidence of felony perjury, and a denied background check to trigger an investigation each and every time. We prosecute fewer than 100 per year. The number of people prosecuted for a crime doesn't necessarily have any relation to the number of crimes committed.Hilary's out. She doesn't go on her knees, that was Monica's job.Universal service isn't a right.Most of that advertising consists of pharma reps visiting doctors and leaving buckets of samples that we get to use for free. A minority is the ads we see.&gt;But Carson was not offered West Point, he simply discussed it. 

We are talking about memoirs decades later. To a kid, being told he has a spot at West Point if he wants it is to him a full scholarship, because that's effectively what it is when he's looking at paying at other schools.

&gt;Carson never even started the application process at West Point.

That was the point Carson was making. He was offered a free ride, but refused because that's not the way he wanted to go.

Here we have a top-grade ROTC candidate who went on to be a pioneering neurosurgeon, one of the top in the entire world. It's not like we're talking about some underachiever making wild claims. 

&gt;By Carson's standards, I could say I was offered a full ride at MIT.

If the MIT President told you to go ahead and apply and you'd get a free ride, you'd have the equivalent of Carson. Nepotism is one of the requirements to get in -- you must have a recommendation. Academics are only a part of WP entry, they're looking for people who will overall make fine officers. Thus, the recommendation of the highest-ranked Army officer does not go ignored. Interesting article from Schneider, thanks. I didn't know we'd started to be able to detect them that far. It must be some pretty sensitive equipment. 1. That would be pretty good; however, you still need to find a way to make sure people are automatically registered in their district. You can move to a town with zero interaction with City Hall. How do you suggest such people are automatically registered? This isn't Germany where by law you must register your residence in your city, which automatically registers you to vote.

2. We just need to stop thinking of elections in relation to presidential elections. Most elections actually occur every two years, for senators, congressmen, etc. It's the presidential election that's the off one.

3. Reduce democracy?

4. Straight party voting is horrible, practically ensuring those parties have a lock on politics. 

5. This is about the best thing we could do.

But the biggest problem is that too many people in the country don't give a damn. And since they don't give a damn, I don't think we should be doing anything to encourage them to vote. They'll be the least informed voters in the population, making the worst possible choices. Oh no, someone who remembered meeting an important person as a teenager decades earlier forgot the exact date when he wrote his memoirs! Crucify him![Proof here](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/239272.pdf) (PDF). Of 76,142 denials, only 62 prosecutions in 2010. Now a few tens of thousands of these were False denials, the person wasn't really prohibited. This leaves tens of thousands of cases where the person can be proved to have perjured himself. Or decades later he couldn't remember whether it was February or Memorial Day, both times he was at military-related functions, one of those attended by Westmoreland. Sig Heil!I was just watching a cooking show with the wife, and the people all had to stop and do nothing for an hour to let bread rise. They were all sitting around talking, looking at the oven, etc. All I could think of is that I would be in a chair in a corner half asleep, you know, where you are sort of sleeping but listening for any sound where you need to snap back up. I learned that one in the Army, sleep when you can. I've slept just leaning forward on a missile launcher, using the inside webbing of the helmet as a pillow.&gt; Not allowing people to pour oil all over the floor in a factory is, well, safe

Pouring oil on the floor is a willful act with the intent to cause injury to another. Don't confuse an injurious act with mere possession.Your details are fantastical. One of the top ROTC students being encouraged by a high-ranking officer isn't. &gt;It's only possible if you assume other dates.

Which is easy to do.Target rifles are "purpose built" for punching holes in paper.How do we know what district you can vote in? Many people who have SSNs are not citizens.That's it pretty much, they're just unhappy with how it came out, and will always just bitch. Contrast with Democrats, who when they see that talk radio has a conservative bias they demand the government do something about it.

Edit: About the market. The single most popular network by far is the conservative one. There are just many more liberal ones that each get lesser ratings.[Barrel length and velocity](http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/calibers.html)You mean the Jewish indigenous population?Everybody came to the Americas from somewhere else.&gt;It's a little unfortunate, in that logic and common sense suggest that it would be a good crime-fighting tool

Only if you don't think it through all the way, which is usually the case with gun laws.Hunters of medium and big game usually use rifles that have a lot more power than an AR-15."Well, they haven't succeeded in taking your guns, so you can't complain." Yep, I've heard stuff like that. They haven't succeeded because we keep complaining and fighting.California does do the right thing sometimes.Nice selection from the photos, designed to make him look like an egomaniac. No, the ones from the lines who were living there since before Islam was invented, and later imposed on the area by force. Many more later came, welcomed by the Muslim empire that ruled the land because they brought money and commerce to the region. Do you see Republicans calling for the reintroduction of the fairness doctrine? You'll notice Democrats were only calling for that for radio where their views are a minority, not TV where their views are the majority. &gt;I get that you're a Republican

Nope.

&gt;and we're probably enjoying the death of Carson's campaign too much

I'm enjoying it too, but for legitimate reasons. The ridiculous pyramid story is great. This story is an overreach by a liberal media out to destroy him, and it only discredits the plenty of truthful stories about him. 

&gt;He's not presidential material. 

That was obvious to me early on. &gt;He has no political experience, so no voting record to scrutinize. 

This is a good thing. Look what's happened when we went with establishment politicians lately. Our country was originally set up with the idea of citizen legislators in mind, not the career politicians we have these days. Being in office was fulfilling a duty for a short time, not riding the gravy train for your whole career.&gt;We know why the gun exists, and we know that the purpose of them is for.

You brought up the purpose of their building, making the subject fair game. For target rifles, that purpose is not killing anything. Even many AR-15s are built for the purpose of competitive shooting, again not killing. Or maybe you want to get away from the "purpose" thing and into the utility?Looks like he remembered something from February instead of Memorial Day, decades later as he was writing memoirs. Kind of like how Obama remembered an uncle liberating Auschwitz, when that was impossible, but it was really Buchenwald.&gt;we're near the top in measures of interest in politics, persuading others to vote for a particular candidate, campaign contact, etc

But we're pretty low in actually bothering to get off our lazy asses and vote. Even though we have to register, it's pretty damn easy for almost everyone. The stories of difficulty you hear don't come anywhere close to accounting for the low turnout. 

&gt;You're required to update your ID, like a driver's license, to your new address. 

If we had such an ID, I could see automatic registration. The ID would have to, at voting time, be hashed against a list of eligible voters (discounting non-citizens and those otherwise ineligible). Normally this eligibility is taken care of at registration time, so pushing it off to voting time would incur the risk of last-minute problems preventing the person from voting. But I see these as just things that need to be worked out, not really showstoppers.

&gt;Even then, though, an election every two years would be a huge improvement over the current system.

That's what we have. Every two years all of our congressmen and one third of our senators are elected, but for some reason a huge chunk of our population thinks elections are every four years, when the president is elected.

&gt;And again, if you're looking to increase participation, simplifying the process is a good start

Not simplifying it to that extent. If the state is to recognize that parties exist, then all parties must be treated equally.The age requirement is 17-23.&gt;No. I want someone that has political experience. Too much at stake. 

So you want someone that you know has already been bought and paid for. Even Trump has quite a bit of political experience, having dealt closely with the politicians he's bought for decades. He knows how the system works as well as any pre-purchased politician. If I could show the government fully-funded and diversified retirement assets that negated the need to ever draw SS, I'd still be making payments. 1942 was a strange movie.It's either ignorance or a willful desire to insert more unneeded bureaucracy into gun ownership. Neither of these is a good thing. We already have them saying things like "We need federal laws to stop the flow of guns from Georgia to New York" when the usual gun pipeline transaction involves at least four federal felonies already.

I don't think they care if laws or programs are already on the books. They just want new laws. &gt;Oh shit so let's dig up 1000+ years of history and randomly re-assign land based on that in 2015. 

You talked about who is "indigenous." If you go back to before Israel, "Palestinian" was used to describe mainly Jews, long before Islam existed. What we think of as "Palestinians" now are mainly descendants of Jews who converted to Islam, and to some extent Christianity. The Jews and Palestinians are basically all one ethnic group. The Muslims just don't like that non-Muslim ones are returning home. &gt;like the .308, which also comes in an AR-15 package.

Technically when you go .308, you're talking about an AR-10.

I understand there are a huge number of different calibers for the AR-15, but .223 is the default. We're talking about some of the most gun-ignorant people in the world here, so the one they're talking about when they say "high-powered assault rifle" is the .223 that they see in the news, the only caliber that has been used in mass shootings. The concept that you can get an AR-15 anywhere from .22LR to .458 SOCOM is just too confusing for them. 

On a side note, this makes the magazine size limits much more fun. "It is not an illegal 30-round .223 magazine, it's a legal 10-round .458 SOCOM magazine."It's very simple. The #1 right is the right to life. In order to enjoy this right, we must have the ability to protect that right using the most effective means possible. The gun is that most effective means; therefore, the right to it must be protected as much as the right to life itself. 

The gun is the only thing that allows a wheelchair-bound 90 year-old lady to be on a physical par with the six-foot teenager intent on beating her to death with his fists for her welfare check. As they say, "If it saves just one life." If you ban guns, grandma died because **you** removed her ability to protect herself. 

Oh, you can try to argue that guns in general threaten my right to life, but that's a generalized, nebulous threat. My individual safety as I as a free citizen choose to secure takes priority over generalized, nebulous claims. I am the one that, faced with violence, will have been disarmed by you.

&gt;it's because criminals have been able to legally acquire them, which is even worse, and furthers reinforces how bad US gun laws are.

What they describe is already illegal. More laws help how? That ATF agent isn't happy because administrations simply don't put much effort into enforcing our current gun laws. Of the tens of thousands of people who lie on a background check form to get a gun each year, we prosecute fewer than 100. Bush wasn't much better, stayed under 200.

&gt;Infact Chicago criminals simply get guns from Indiana.

This is already illegal. In fact, the usual transaction comprises at least four distinct federal felonies, not to mention state law violations. 

&gt;Infact you don't even have to forcibly take away guns from citiziens and criminals, because without anywhere to easily find and acquire ammos in the US territory it would be impossible for criminals to have an unlimited amount of them

Except for the fact that you can reload ammo. Don't feel bad, one of our anti-gun congresswomen didn't know you could reload a magazine. 

&gt;Wrong! It's actually the USA with its endless supply of weapons that manages to refill Mexico and Southern America criminals with guns and ammos, not the other way around.

Straw sales going to Mexico are already illegal. However, most US weapons that are found there are due to our sales to the Mexican government, which then make their way to the cartels. I also wouldn't trust your source due to repeating a lie, "Two out of every three illegal firearms found in Mexico come from the United States." This is incorrect. Of the weapons they recovered, a subset were deemed traceable. Of those, a subset were deemed likely to have originated in the US. Of those, 2/3 did come from the US. Overall, the US civilian market supplied a small minority of guns -- illegally.

This False statistic is like me picking all the males in a prison, then picking the ones in there for sex offenses, and then being surprised that most of my remaining sample are rapists. 

&gt;It's a False notion that owning a gun makes you safer.

This is an unsupported claim. Research claiming this has failed even the most basic sanity checks.

&gt;Lastly, I will leave you with an excellent anti-gun article on the issue.

It's a horrible article that will take a whole other post to refute. It's like the Gish Gallop, throw so much rapid-fire bullshit against the wall that your opponent will have no time to logically refute every single one. 

But overall, notice the article does not mention Switzerland, which has fairly liberal gun laws -- even more so than the US in some regards -- and yet has less violent crime than these countries with heavy restrictions?
You claimed the "Palestinians" as indigenous as opposed to the Jews. I simply proved that wrong. They have no more right to the place than the Jews do.Six years ago people were calling this level of scrutiny racist because the candidate was black. These are mainly the same people who are doing the scrutinizing this time.If he's right, rational people admit we were wrong and move along.  I still think the ridiciule would be justified because as of this time there isn't a shred of evidence to support his hypothesis.Who do you want with his finger on the button? The guy who thinks he'll be rewarded for eternity for pushing it? Or the guy who thinks he's going to permanently end his own existence and that of everyone he cares for? Obama's uncle didn't free Auschwitz. And the whoppers didn't stop, remember when he claimed her mother's health insurance was denied on her deathbed in order to push Obamacare? That was a lie too, and we were racist for pointing it out. Obama had many of his own lies.&gt; while the remaining Palestinians were driven out because they were Christians and Muslims

Because they started attacking Jews. They've been attacking the local Jews ever since the fall of the Ottomans left no Muslim authority to keep them in check. Quite the opposite, their current Muslim authorities say it's fine to kill Jews. 

&gt;Those people have more of a claim to the land than the additional Jews who were shipped in from foreign countries to fill up the bulk of Israel's population today. 

You must have missed the part about them being the same group of people. Some are just returning to their homeland.He's not right. They found a small part of one pyramid that may hold a previously undiscovered chamber, that's all. We already know what Egyptian granaries looked like, and it wasn't giant pyramids that would be some the most inefficient granaries imaginable. 

Even if he were proven right, I still wouldn't vote for him. Why not both? We knew back in the early 90s that she had presidential aspirations. People from Arkansas probably knew that earlier. About what? Pyramids? Actual evidence. Carson? Probably nothing.

Edit: I don't know. Carson vs. Clinton? I may fall towards disliking him less, or just give a protest vote in disgust at my options. &gt;NBC stations similarly posted the notice after Hillary Clinton\u2019s un-announced guest appearance on SNL last month though, in that case, candidates only were entitled to about 3 minutes. **And, of course, that notice did not make headlines.**

No, no bias here. &gt;Since 9 is a greater number than 2 we have to conclude Carson lied.

Or that he didn't tell it to all of his friends. &gt;he misspoke his uncle only helped liberate the concentration camps at buchenwald germany, not auschwitz

I actually give him a pass on that, just like I give Carson a pass on not remembering exactly when he was told he could get a full scholarship at West Point. 

&gt;as for his mother it was disability insurance not health insurance, which the difference is of some significance when you're pushing for health insurance reform

Which makes it such an egregious lie. It was not just some general anecdote of no importance like Carson's. Obama tried to persuade people to support mandated medical insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions by claiming his mother was denied medical insurance coverage for a pre-existing condition. 

&gt;And finally I'd say in all these cases the mistake was immediately owned up to when it was pointed out.

Not really, they just did what you did, "still denied, so we were really correct." She even handed her case over to Obama while he was an attorney. He doesn't have the excuse that Carson has, just being a high-schooler much longer before.&gt; It was when the boat loads of foreign Jews arrived to build a country only for Jews on land that was already occupied by majority non-Jews that they were attacked - and expectedly so. 

The Jews had been coming for decades before the attacks. The Ottomans wanted the Jews there. They brought commerce, money, peace. As long as they lived under Ottoman rules, they were protected. The violence started after the British Mandate, the Muslims doing their version of "Auslander raus!" -- hatred of new immigrants and the call for them to leave. 

&gt;In other words foreigners came to take land that belonged to the indigenous population and they were met with resistance.

You mean came back to the land they were kicked out of. The Palestinians want "right of return," so do the Jews.

&gt;Not to mention stealing other people's land based on religious ties is barbaric

They actually bought much of that land during immigration. Most of the rest they conquered in legitimate defense against a war of annihilation waged against them. When I was a kid my parents got cable with trial HBO and Showtime for six months, never intending to keep either. The cable company never turned it off, but never started billing us for it either. This was back when they had to come to your house and fiddle with the cable box to do anything, and they just never bothered to come out and disable it I guess.Artillery is cool on the originating end, scary on the receiving end.

That, and on a twisty mountain road in the Winter with no guard rail next to a very tall cliff, and the car starts sliding back and sideways on ice. &gt;And I want to make something else clear she was denied for having a pre existing condition

She was not denied health insurance coverage due to her pre-existing condition, which was in context the point that Obama was trying to make. Going to disability insurance leaves the context of Obama's statement. 

&gt;in fact most fact check websites 

I see "mostly False" from politifact, and ... hahahaha, you're funny, Media Matters? Really? It's one of the least trustworthy political sites on the Internet, created by a right-wing hit man turned left-wing hit man.

&gt;So to your "double standard," Here it is on the one hand you have someone who can't handle being questioned about his life and blames a media conspiracy

Just like Obama's supporters claimed racism. No, but going batshit crazy in an effort to take him out for good tends to work. Nobody wants to mess with crazy. [The short list](http://www.ijreview.com/2015/11/465980-False-things-obama-said-about-his-bio-that-didnt-cause-the-media-to-go-into-full-meltdown/). I loved his conception being inspired by something that happened when he was three years old. &gt;And again, it's an issue of incentives driven by the structural design of our government 

I just have less faith in our people. When a reporter goes to random people who have no clue about anything in the government, it's a bit disheartening. 

&gt;Lots of people across the country voted just this past Tuesday.

I forgot about those small off-year ones. Yes, syncing those up with the even-year elections may be a good idea. 

&gt;Point 4 wasn't about reducing things to just Democrats and Republicans, it was reducing things to being able to say just a party name

I'm for quality over quantity. I'd prefer a smaller number of informed voters over a larger number where many of them have only enough mental faculty to say "Herp derp Repuplikhun" based on what they saw on TV and check one box. This only encourages the influence of money in politics because it makes money more effective.&gt; reloaded, fired, reloaded, fired, reloaded, fired, FOR TEN F*CKING MINUTES.

And these would have been Enfields, which had a famously high rate of fire and reloaded quickly using five-round stripper clips. It must have been horrible.My local family shooting club was created with help from the NRA to design the ranges, to insure the place, and the NRA even helped them get a loan to buy the clubhouse. The NRA offers programs, training, and even scholarships for the members. Desiring membership in the NRA is just their way to pay back. If it helps, little of regular membership dues goes directly to politics. 

If you're really against joining the NRA, maybe you could make regular donations directly to the NRA Foundation and put that on the form. The NRA Foundation is the tax-deductible, and thus non-political, arm of the NRA dedicated to all of the above. If they ask, say you don't like how the NRA wastes such a huge amount of money on mailers, and you'd prefer your money go directly to doing good.

Edit: If you do join the NRA, you can tell them not to mail all the junk to you, but that doesn't stop the tens of millions they spend junk mail overall. Every member should check the "no mail" box. My club founders said NRA membership was just the right thing to do given all the NRA help.This is like saying freedom of speech is bad because some of the people who wrote the 1st Amendment used speech to support slavery.  Different people had different priorities for themselves in their reasoning, and they squabbled over the federal/state roles in the militia, but the overall right itself was never in question.&gt;Of the 10 items on that list 7 are things that he would have been told by his parents or grandparents, not things he made up.

One, no, he credits the march. Two, yes, a lie. Three, a lie. Stories? Not an excuse. Others were able to find the facts, he never bothered, or purposely lied. Remember, this was only the short list.

&gt;none of it is of the self aggrandizing nature of Ben Carson's crazy fabrications

He tied his very existence to the Selma march, thus claiming a personal connection to one of the seminal moments in our nation's history. That's self-aggrandizing far more than Carson. Pixar assassins.The Carson campaign wasn't attacking his overall character, but pointing to clear evidence of his political bias. Of course not, retraction is the honest thing to do. Instead, they're doubling down. All  these attacks over irrelevant items in his bio show me they're scared of him. Using "her" in relation to a country is just an older style of writing that we still often see in reference to ships. He's claiming bias in the press, which is a common theme these days, and backing it up with facts. Holder's gone. Maybe this new AG wants to actually be an AG instead of how Holder considered the purpose of the job to be cover for Obama. It's used for countries in general, it's just an older usage so you won't hear it much. Over the last hundred years or so, we've moved away from "her" for general things. The biggest vestige left is nautical, but even there you'll usually see ships as "it" among the general population instead of the traditional "her."&gt;So being arrested over a decade ago and having the charges dismissed is indicative of bias?

Protesting against Republicans enough to get arrested definitely shows bias. 

&gt;Apparently lying about being offered a full scholarship to West Point is perfectly fine, though.

Except he didn't lie. Being offered a spot at West Point is being offered a full scholarship. He said he didn't apply because that's not the direction he wanted to go.Remember, she was never up for charges for what she did in the IRS. This was about charges for contempt of Congress. The claim by Republicans was that her short statement of innocence waived her subsequent 5th Amendment protection claim, which is absurd. Had they prosecuted, it probably would not have been upheld on appeal. 

Not choosing to prosecute was rational.&gt;Start talking about actual policies, and you'll get questions about your actual policies.

He is talking about policies, but the press wants to go after the book.&gt;that's the lie and it's not going away.

Decades later, he mixed up when teenager him met a famous person: was it February (when Westmoreland was in town) or Memorial Day? Oh no! Such a dishonest person! His recollection of Medal of Honor recipients being honored at the event points to February more, since that's what Westmoreland was in town for at that time. I think a high-school science student would answer with that response. A physicist might say "Explain your challenge mathematically, because the 'entropy' description of the 2nd Law is only one of the English language approximations of the math that defines the 2nd Law."I've met creationist West Point officers. In fact, West Pointers tend to be more religious than the general population, and the whole environment there is quite religious. When it comes to religion, otherwise extremely smart people can have some serious blinders on. Such dishonesty. "Ohio shortened early voting by six days." Oh no, this is horrible! How many early voting days do they have left? One? Two? Something so shortened so as to prevent people from voting so we need a voting holiday?

Nope. Ohio still has 21 early voting days.&gt;However, the point was Carson fabricated the whole story about West Point 

Except he didn't.&gt;how could he not see this coming?

That is a legitimate sentiment. Book tour or not, he had to know the hit squad would be after him, nitpicking through every tiny aspect of his life. Remember what they did to Palin?&gt;Being arrested shows nothing. Perhaps you've heard of the presumption of innocence?

The judicial process is entirely irrelevant. He was protesting Republicans. It shows he is heavily biased.&gt;"It may make someone feel good for a moment, but it's not really of benefit."

This describes most gun laws."Hello, police? My liberal social studies professor keeps telling us how rich white people are bad and need to pay more money to everyone else. My family's rich, and I find that hateful and hurtful. Do you still do no-knock SWAT raids over the tiniest little thing?"Christians here have it very good that they can complain about Starbucks cups and having to serve gays. Elsewhere, they're actually being killed, and building a church is illegal. So you're saying he wasn't part of the demonstration? If that claim is indeed True, then the Carson attack would be baseless. You haven't been following? At most he mixed up dates, a February event for Medal of Honor recipients instead of Memorial Day. If Obama can mix up concentration camps, Carson can mix up events. Even Politifact is on Carson's side on this. Two separate things. The granary thing is of course hilarious. The liberal machine is pretty vicious about that these days, we even have a word for it derived from their most famous campaign -- Borking. Whether or not it's fair, he does need to be able to handle it, and I agree that his inability to do so isn't exactly presidential. You mean when as a kid who was a stellar ROTC leader a high-ranking officer told him he could get a full scholarship to West Point? Even Politifact agrees it wasn't a fabrication. &gt;The meeting with Westmoreland was a fabrication.

No, he mistook a February event as Memorial day, decades later while writing what he remembered from when he was teen.

&gt;Fact is, he never applied and was never considered

What shows me the liberals are desperate is when they repeat him. Yes, he himself originally said that he did not want to apply. That was the whole point of the story, that he wanted to be a doctor instead of a regular Army officer.Since BLM protesters themselves described the shooting as self defense, I wonder why they're even being charged.How about Muslim bigots?Spike Lee's latest gang movie probably showcases where most of our gun violence comes from, but of course they'll want laws that affect everyone else, doing little to address that source of gun violence.&gt;We just had another Planned Parenthood clinic attacked by Christian Terrorists.

Attacked by a nut job who may or may not be a Christian terrorist. So far all we have to link him to the pro-life movement is some semi-coherent mumbling that's been reported, and the fact that this started near a clinic (he didn't go in and start shooting). I don't mind if he is a Christian terrorist, it's not like we haven't had them before, but this may just be a psycho. 

Compare with Muslim terrorists, who appear completely normal, generally show normal or above average intelligence, and commit their acts in a planned manner. These aren't psychos, they are carefully carrying out the will of their deity as they see it. As much as I dislike CAIR, may I suggest that all they need to do is have a Muslim member attempt to purchase a gun and be denied, and then back his lawsuit. I do wonder whether this guy is all wind, or if he'll refuse $600 cash on his counter. The media and politicians who turned a simple self-defense case into a media sensation have created this monster. Alternate title, "Democrats waste taxpayers money by challenging laws." We could say the same switched around in other places, "California spends $$$ defending unconstitutional gun laws." 

This is just how the game is played.From your article, "The motive for the rampage however is unclear."&gt;I think the important difference here is that this "lone nutter" DID, in fact, have a religious / political reasoning behind his actions

It appears he may. He may also be too insane to have a real reason. Almost all Muslim terrorist acts are calmly planned and executed by people who know exactly why they are doing them. I saw the video before reading, and it was obvious they were caught by a cable. The car to the right being effected makes it pretty clear. MADD in the US has been behind pushing the limit lower in a neo-prohibitionist move. The founder of MADD even quit the organization because they lost sight of the original vision, simply to combat drunk driving. We've had flying bicycles since the 1960s. The Gossamer Albatross, which looks like an exercise bike mounted under a wing, crossed the English Channel in the 1970s. 

Edit: "is intended to be an \u2018all-electric personal flight device" It's not even a bicycle. Except in very rare medical cases, it's entirely the person's fault. Even in those medical cases, treatment is available. Tecchies often make for horrible designers.Read the article. It looks like the pets are well cared for and this didn't cause any damage. She did one stupid thing.Why hypocrisy? I recognize we have Christian terrorists. I see Wikipedia even has a long list of them bombing clinics and shooting doctors. You fail to look at things on a case-by-case basis. This guy may just be completely fucking nuts. It's like saying the protestants didn't back the Irish Catholic terrorists. They're still all Christian, they just have doctrinal differences that sometimes cause them to kill each other.No, there haven't. This is the GrC expanded definition of mass shooting, not the official one.  GrC even counted people shot with a BB gun as a mass shooting. Of course, the media uses the expanded number to stir panic.France doesn't have a massive drug war underway, rampant organized crime and gang problem, and dilapidated inner cities that foster all of this. Most people who are killed by guns in the US already have a criminal history, most of the killings are among the criminal class. 

If you don't associate with criminals, your chances of being killed by someone with a gun are much lower than the national average. Interesting comments for sure, I just object to the "mystery" description. This wasn't much harder to figure out than determining gravity had something to do with a jumper hitting the ground. &gt;Maybe it won't be drastic, but a reduction will happen and any reduction is good. 

You get to apologize to the son of the woman stabbed to death by her violent ex husband because the government wouldn't allow her to have a gun to protect herself. Some schemes also require that you buy demo product from them. Unless you get a lot of people under you, you'll never make up for what you spend on demo product. &gt;You act like that death wouldn't have happened anyways.

With a chance at defense, it is less likely she'll die. 

&gt;less equals better, it equals progress at fixing a problem. 

While creating another. As part of a larger incoherent rambling. True, we do encourage gun shops to refuse sales to anyone they get a bad feeling from. How are you differentiating these two concepts? The source of gun violence is mostly existing criminal enterprise. The reason for crime is a much deeper discussion. A causal relation is difficult to show. The UK has certainly had an [increase in crime](http://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/) after their gun ban. This doesn't include the fact that the UK police notoriously under-report crime in order to make themselves look more effective. 

Can you show me any that banning guns decreases crime within our society? Note that in the US, we've had a liberalization of gun laws, tens of millions more guns sold, and a huge increase in carrying guns, all during a time where gun crime is decreasing. Meanwhile, our most dangerous cities have the strictest gun laws. 

The number one thing in the US that we could do to reduce crime is stop the war on drugs and turn to a treatment-oriented approach. &gt;Zimmerman was a monster before

Mentoring black kids. What a monster!

But that's irrelevant to his case. Personally I think he's a bit of a scumbag. But then, scumbags have the right to defend themselves too. We all cite the Miranda decision as a triumph of rights, yet forget that Miranda actually did kidnap and rape that girl. He spent the rest of his life living off that dubious fame (selling signed Miranda cards) while committing various other crimes, until he was stabbed to death in a bar fight. The problem wasn't as bad during Jim Crow, when black families were even lower income than now. If they bring a working-age male into the household, do they get less money?&gt; I would expect an increase in gun crime / homicides directly after banning guns.

Why is that? In Australia they technically had an increase, but the statistics were warped by one incident. Otherwise, crime just kept going down like it was before the ban, same as it has in the US where we have more and more guns, and more people carrying.

&gt;You do realize however that in your article that you posted where there is a graph showing a huge difference, the difference is only 7 people, right? 

Irrelevant, and remember that 7 is not correct due to the way the UK misreports. 

&gt;Like I have said, banning guns is part of the fi, there needs to be other fixes as well. 

Banning guns attempts to patch a symptom, while violating rights and creating other problems. Patch the actual problem. Guns are just an easy scapegoat for lazy authoritarians.

&gt; Europe is a good place since most freely traveled borders have the same gun restrictions.

Interesting you mention Europe, which includes Switzerland, which in ways has more lax gun laws than we do in the US. Over there, they can actually buy a new fully-automatic rifle, and there are no "assault weapon" bans. They have low gun crime too. 

&gt;They would need to be banned everywhere in the US to start pulling decent stats in restricting guns. 

Except that wouldn't happen. The hundreds of millions of guns in circulation would just increasingly be owned by the criminal class, who can also make their own if necessary, especially in this 3D printing age. If you've been reading the news, you've probably read about the "pipeline" of handguns from liberal Georgia to strict New York. Because the reporting tries to push for new laws to make this illegal, you probably don't realize that the average person doing this violates about four federal laws already (perjury on the form when purchasing, purchasing out of state, knowingly selling to criminals, and dealing firearms without a license). So increasing poverty can't be the reason. The reason is almost always associated with criminal activity. Lower crime overall, you lower gun crime. So she gets more money if the baby daddy officially stays out of the household so his income won't be counted. This means an absent male does increase the grant. &gt;Kind of a convoluted scenario you are suggesting

It's SOP. Multiple baby daddies means a bigger paycheck. 

&gt;but if the absent male is out of the household and has income, when the application for assistance is made, a justice department case is opened and child support is ordered

If the baby daddy is officially known to the state. Then if he is known, if he has *reported* income. It appears you didn't read my post. I never said he was a good person. I just said he had a right to defend himself. Miranda wasn't a good person, but he had a right to know his rights. 

OTOH, it's interesting that pointing out Obama's racism is considered racist. Uncle Tom, don't need to listen to him (hands over ears, "na na na na na"). More kids = more welfare money. She still may see the fathers, may still get money on the side, but if they play it smart, the government won't get any cut of that. This disincentivizes marrying one man and settling down, because that reduces the benefits. &gt; people, are (i) absolutely intrinsically, non-denumerably infinitely valuable, beyond all possible economics

This is why their ability to protect themselves must not be interfered with. 

&gt;autonomous rational animals, which means they can act freely for good reasons

Even more reason why their right to arm themselves shouldn't be infringed upon. 

&gt;morally obligated to respect each other and to be actively concerned for each other\u2019s well-being and happiness

Even further, their ability to protect one another's well-being shouldn't be interfered with. 

This guy's statements contradict his conclusion. &gt;heavily implies you think he is a good person. 

In the real world, people rarely completely fit into one category. Overall I think he's a scumbag, but that's not to say a scumbag can't do the occasional good thing. He's all over any injustice, actual or perceived, done to blacks, yet he ignores black on white violence. That's racism. The truth is very scary to fat people in denial, same as an alcoholic. I myself am a bit overweight, but I'm honest enough to admit it's entirely my own damn fault. The liberal press, the same one that edited the 911 call to make Zimmerman look racist, has no interest in finding stories that don't demonize him. I've never met one either. I've seen many online though. So, I get to choose between the standard Republican and Democrat, where they're lying all the time, and Trump, where there's a chance he's telling the truth? This makes a good case for Trump. So, a guy who pushed for rights as a lawmaker is going to join an organization that pushes for the same rights? Color me shocked.This is ideology. He has a pro-rights ideology, he will gravitate towards people working for the same ideology. This guy went to work for a five-million member organization that supports gun rights. This isn't like when Chris Dodd was well-paid by the MPAA while in office, then turned around to head the MPAA. There are actually lots of legal restrictions on that, and people have gone to jail over it. What's with all the Henry hate?Take classes, buy gun, practice, get license. Don't listen to tacticool oper8ors. You're not kitting up for the apocalypse. If this is purely your purpose, a smallish 9mm semi or a double-action revolver around .38 will do it, and are good for beginners. These cartridges are also cheap to buy, enabling more practice, while having more powerful +P self-defense versions on the shelves.

That safety switch is something you'll forget to take off while you're frantically trying to fire at your attacker and nothing's going boom while your panicked mind wonders why. A modern 9mm has two or three safeties built in for you. Only pulling the trigger makes it go boom. 

Don't forget revolvers. A Ruger LCR for example is small, inexpensive, works every time, and more importantly, like any double-action revolver it's completely brain dead. Even a dud misfire (no boom on trigger pull) just requires another pull of the trigger to try the next round, which is what your panicked mind will do by instinct anyway. You need to re-rack a semi-auto in that case, and train yourself in doing it.

In the end, make sure you handle and dry fire a bunch of them. Comfort of the grip and trigger are very important, and one size definitely doesn't fit all. My hands are pretty picky about the grip, but I don't mind a wide variety of triggers. &gt;The design was obsolete in 1873.

Why? It eliminates that side gate that wants to snap your fingers and can have mechanical problems, plus losing the bluing due to constant wear. It also allows you to speedload from a tube of bullets. I don't know how he does this with a clean conscience, he just does. Such is racism. I see nothing wrong with an officer leaving the service and then getting a job that allows him to use his general knowledge of the service. It's just rational that an signals officer would continue to use his skills for military communications contractor. Should we spend major money trying to get a civilian up to date on how the military works instead, and still end up with an employee with an inferior understanding?

Even where they aren't breaking laws, contractors are careful to avoid even the appearance of impropriety because of the possible consequences. You can be an former officer working for the company, but then they start trying to get a contract for your previous unit, you will find yourself pushed out of what could have been a great professional opportunity even if you didn't plan on doing anything illegal. If your company won the contract with you on the team, an opposing contractor would latch onto that fact in its challenge to the award, and things would get really ugly. Your company would have to produce evidence that it had a plan on how to avoid ethical concerns and proof that it followed the plan. &gt; but I think that trump being taken seriously as a politician when what he does is very dangerous. 

That's what's attractive. He's not the standard lying politician. However bad it is, we know he speaks for himself instead of speaking as a puppet of the party and financial backers. 

I support rights, including gun rights. So as an example, I'd rather have a bullshitter use lies to promote gun control than someone I know is sincerely using lies to promote gun control. I know the former isn't likely to do anything about it because he doesn't really care, but the latter is likely to use those lies to infringe on my rights. I'm not really a Trump fan, but I am tired of the standard lying politician. &gt;Loading gates replaced the older system for a reason

They didn't completely replace the older system obviously. Newer isn't always better, just different. Interesting speed loader, a lot more complicated than the simple tube with taped ends you need for the tube loader. &gt;As long as you're okay with the current number of mass shootings I guess it's okay.

Mass shootings are a blip on the overall number of deaths. They're just hyped up, which produces two results: It gives anti-gunners something to put in headlines, and it encourages more people to seek fame by committing these shootings. 

&gt;I mean, it's not like the NRA is opposed to the government studying or collecting gun data, right?

That is correct. The NRA has only opposed the CDC using government money to support gun control causes. The NRA-supported law does not prohibit the CDC from doing neutral gun research, but since they're not allowed to do studies designed to push the gun control agenda, they choose instead to do no research for fear of producing research that didn't support their political position. &gt;Only one brand still uses the old system aomost exclusively. 

But other brands still use it. 

&gt;Have you ever tried to load a Henry in a hurry?

Have you ever needed to load a Henry in a hurry? Why? Are you using it as a home defense gun and are trying to reload on the go like you do with shotgun drills? I shoot my tube loaders at the range and while hunting, neither of which require fast reloading. 

To me it comes down to looks and general feels.&gt;Yeah. Marlin. That's about it. 

There were lots of .22 tube loaders throughout the 20th Century. I have a few myself. But for most people just see tube magazines in general, whether breech or tube loaded, as old fashioned, so not many are made anymore outside of leverguns and shotguns. 

&gt; It's kind of like folks still driving manuals.

There you go describing me again. I love the level of control a manual gives. Automatics don't shift exactly when and how I want them to. I think most votes for Trump will be protest votes against the existing political power structure same as they were for Perot in 1992. If Trump gets the nomination, and especially the presidency, it will seriously shake up the political power structure in this country more than any other candidate could, including Sanders. 

No matter how unattractive Trump himself is, that rebellion is quite attractive. 2 is already a crime in some states too.

I like 4: "We need solutions, but only from within our anti-gun echo chamber." Oh, you wanted to know how supporting blacks over whites is racism? I thought it was self-explanatory. He doesn't want war any more than any other candidate except maybe Sanders, and he wouldn't really build a wall because that's not good business. As far as the environment, he's at least not owned by any of the polluting interests like the other candidates are. &gt;That's a lazy generalization.

It's True though. If not an outright lie, it's a distortion, or cherry-picked numbers. Okay, I'll admit honestly may sometimes creep through, but no more than Trump.Supporting the belligerent black professor over the white cop who was just responding to a call.1% doesn't mean conservative. Most news organizations are run and staffed by liberals, while liberal-run journalism schools continue to pump out new liberal staff.His initial reaction backed the belligerent professor against the cop doing his job. Only after the public backlash did he back down and propose that stupid beer summit.According to Brandenberg, the speech must be intended and likely to result in imminent lawless action. General undirected trash talk on the Internet doesn't apply. What might inspire someone to do something illegal at some future date doesn't qualify. Shouting to a riled-up KKK gathering "Let's go kill those niggers right now" qualifies. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.This has the same message to me as "Republican vows to take on NARAL." It tells me the politician is taking a position against those who protect our rights.Example?It's called "precedent," and I cited it, Brandenburg v Ohio.How is the Resdit home page an example of this?And not long ago our government was steering is away from natural saturated fats and towards transfats, for our own health of course.Now more is starting to come out. See, conclusions based on evidence, not conjecture. Now this will be counted by the VPC as a "Crime committed with a machine gun." It's what they did with .50 BMGs. Ada Lovelace is a goddess among computer geeks. 4 of 31 million people in the US were slaves in 1860, 13%. Interesting, that's about the same percentage of blacks today. Indentured servant contracts have varied widely through history. Apprenticeships could be indentured servitude, service in exchange for learning a trade. Ben Franklin famously was a fugitive for fleeing an apprenticeship under his older brother. Others often were in payment for the trip over to the colonies, and required the person be given items with which to start his new life after the term was over. 

A common practice in rich Muslim countries, is to import workers from impoverished countries, take their passports, and keep them as effective slaves, the local laws giving them little or no protection. They are paid, but very little, and much of that goes to exorbitant fees paid for the flight over, and for their housing and upkeep. 

This is done sometimes in the US to migrant farm workers. The workers aren't really held captive as with the Muslims, but they get almost nothing out of their pay after outrageous room, board, and food prices are factored in. Not only is overt dissent not allowed, slight deviation from the PC mantra will be severely punished. "The heresy of heresies was common sense."I'm sure some part of the NRA organization has an FFL, but if you win a giveaway you still have to pick up the gun at your local FFL with background check. &gt;The NRA sells fear

The NRA sells fear of losing gun rights as much as the ACLU sells fear of losing your other rights. 

&gt;Its their job as a lobby representing the gun manufacturing industry.

The gun industry has a representative, the National Shooting Sports Foundation. The NRA's funds come mainly from members, who it represents. This was likely gang related, don't snitch. They were lucky to get one witness. Nobody saw that guy in Detroit get shot during a 400-person block party. Nobody helps the police, then they complain when crime is rampant. We need to be done with the other cancer too, the Clintons. &gt;$150,000 bond for handing out a piece of paper on a public sidewalk? Speechless

That's what you get when you offend the establishment. Unless he targeted people he knew were jurors in specific cases before the court, he's going to win. I hope he wins the followup wrongful arrest suit. People can be excused for reasons of financial hardship. They gave us reserved parking right behind the courthouse. 13 spots, all for us.During our selection, one guy who was just starting a job feared loss of it, but the judge told him it was illegal for them to fire him for jury duty. However, she did defer his duty for six months so he could complete his probation uninterrupted. You wouldn't happen to be in CA, would you?It's a powerful tool that can be used for good or bad. I understand the concept, but people using it lightly pisses me off. This is our system. We the people in the jury *are* the final law, the final check on government overreach. This goes back to colonial times, when a journalist was acquitted for violating laws against criticism of a public official. He absolutely did criticize that official though.&gt;The role of the jury is not to evaluate the law

Yes, it is as upheld by the Supreme Court from Georgia v. Brailsford (1794) through U.S. v. Krzyske (1988). Judges don't like it, and they try to hinder it, but they admit it is an innate power of the jury.It was part of our colonial struggle with an oppressive Britain. It was used to subvert the Fugitive Slave Law by Northerners shielding slaves. It resulted in a large portion of Prohibition prosecutions failing, helping end that atrocity. I think some Vietnam protesters got off because of it too. Who knows how many victims of our drug war it has saved. &gt;It may not be amiss, here, Gentlemen, to remind you of the good old rule, that on questions of fact, it is the province of the jury, on questions of law, it is the province of the court to decide. But it must be observed that by the same law, which recognizes this reasonable distribution of jurisdiction, you have nevertheless a right to take upon yourselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy. On this, and on every other occasion, however, we have no doubt, you will pay that respect, which is due to the opinion of the court: For, as on the one hand, it is presumed, that juries are the best judges of facts; it is, on the other hand, presumbable, that the court are the best judges of the law. But still both objects are lawfully, within your power of decision.

John Jay, first Chief Justice of the United States, Georgia v. Brailsford (1794) &gt;And all it cost were dozens of black people's lives

And all it saved were hundreds of black lives, illegally protected in the North from return to the South. It let blatant abolitionists walk. &gt;Thank you for linking me an absolutely out of date quote.

It has never been overturned, thus it stands, and several following cases confirm it. More recently US v Avery (1983) held that a prosecutor was incorrect in telling a jury it did not have this power. Judges have become more hostile to jury Noneification, but the jury retains the absolute power to find contrary to law. It happens in Malaysia too. &gt;Sure, but it will never be used in courts in the modern day.

From that decision onward, the fundamental power of the jury to rule on law has always been upheld in the United States. 

&gt;Lawyers don't take anyone who knows what jury Noneification is

When I was on a jury, i wasn't asked about the issue. In any case, any smart juror can simply keep his mouth shut as to his reasons and exercise the right that the court illegally tried to strip from him. When proponents use climate change as a vehicle to siphon money from stable countries that made something of themselves to countries that can't maintain any semblance of political or economic stability, they create opposition to climate change. Then they wonder why opposition exists. Why must it be assumed that Clinton would represent women any better than Sanders? &gt;It is almost universally agreed that jurors knowing about jury Noneification is a bad thing. 

It is also universally agreed that jurors retain this power. Courts can go to great lengths to try to suppress it, but it will always be a power that the people retain over their government. 

It's like the government having an army. It is inherently a bad thing, putting so much power into the hands of the government, so ripe for abuse. It was the fear of most of our founders. Yet we all admit that the government does have the legitimate power to amass an army, for sometimes it is needed. 

&gt;Also, the lawyer probably did ask you in a roundabout way.

Didn't even come close. Too much logic! Bloomberg's brain is hurting. They must have found some people who have never heard of him in order to improve the opinion of him. &gt;In Louisiana a legal gun owner can legally sell his gun to a criminal

18 U.S. Code \u00a7 922 (d) "It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person [is prohibited from owning a gun]"

&gt;Background checks are not required. To keep it legal all they had to do was not ask any questions.

Someone not wanting questions asked can constitute "reasonable cause to believe." Someone who intends to sell to criminals, and knowingly sells to them already, isn't going to bother to do a background check even if it is required. He already knows he's breaking the law, so what's another pile-on charge of not doing the check? 

This is why mandatory background checks will only infringe on the rights of law-abiding people who would never knowingly sell to a criminal. This is why all we need is voluntary free open background checks, not mandatory through a dealer. A buyer saying he wants to keep the sale on the "down low" with no check is reasonable cause to believe, and only the criminal-minded would continue with the sale. 

&gt;It's more likely that a legal loophole is how he acquired the gun. 90% of Americans want to close these loopholes

There is no loophole. Given that mandatory universal background checks have been rejected by Congress, it is the law as intended. 

&gt;The lack of stronger firearm laws is to blame, but nice try.

They have very liberal firearm laws in Vermont, with very little crime. &gt;From a fundamental point of view, sure. But the US government isn't quite a dictatorship (yet, at least), and so it's barely relevant in this discussion.

You don't need a dictatorship, just an unjust law, like the Fugitive Slave Act that resulted in jury Noneification in the North. 

&gt;I can't confirm your anecdotal evidence so it's not really fair to bring that up.

I had known about jury Noneification for decades before I had jury duty. I was expecting questions along these lines, but they never came. Interestingly, some questions by the prosecutor were about whether we could be fair to the defendant. I guess in my little corner of the country they're actually looking out for justice, not consolidation of government power. BTW, not guilty, but based on the facts alone while fastidiously following the law.

Perhaps such questions are mainly used in politically sensitive cases involving unpopular laws that the people would rather not see enforced, and the government therefore wants to protect its power over the people. If you think government power is a bad thing look at, wait ... this smog was created by a country with supreme government power over every facet of business, a government that already has its version of the EPA that wouldn't be constrained like ours is, meaning it's the fault of the government policies themselves. We had this requirement called residency in Chicago, and you didn't have that, but you had it swept under the rug.The anti-rights people will be creaming their pants over this, more soft warm bodies to walk on. The article acts as if an EPA would have necessarily solved this, but China has an EPA. &gt; They dont represent me. 

They represent millions of others. 

&gt;And yes I support the Second Amendment

Let me guess, I support the Second Amendment, **but**...&gt;With an environmental problem that is vastly larger than what the EPA had to deal with.

A problem that was created according to government policy, and an EPA that, if the government desired, could do anything it wants. They aren't restrained by the concepts of individual rights or due process that we have here. 

&gt;EPA is not a panacea

Of course not, but the title suggests that them having an EPA would resolve or prevent this. They do have one.This metric is derived by the number of background checks the FBI processed.The latest Democrat demonization is that the NRA is trying to arm terrorists, which make all members contributors to terrorism. Of course it's a lie. The NRA, along with many others, simply opposes the violation of our 5th Amendment right to due process. Even the ACLU opposes using the list for anything affecting people's rights. &gt; It may not be up to Western standards but the idea that China could 

The party rules with absolute power. If they decided they wanted the pollution cleaned up, they have absolute power to make it happen. 

&gt; but you are talking about millions of industrial sites 

All of which were created under a system of strict government authority.&gt;No they don't, you are simply wrong. 

This is a state that enforced a one-child policy for decades, something inconceivable in this country. 

&gt;Sounds like you have some sort of libertarian manchild agenda

No, unlike liberal children, I realize that the presence of a governmental unit doesn't automatically signal positive results. In some cases, it can be correlated with negative results. Ask me about my car and how many people it's killed. Yes, it's the same.Cars kill more than guns, is that a reason to crack down on my car ownership?Reality is crazier than anything they can make up.&gt; And there was nothing unconstitutional proposed in the article.

There was the whole "let's do away with due process" thing.Using the terror watch list to deny gun purchase.You're saying we should restrict the right of someone who has never been convicted of a crime, never been otherwise adjudged ineligible by a court of law, based on a secret government list known to be full of innocent people, that has no simple method of correction? People found themselves on the list because they attended Occupy rallies.I wouldn't know about dad, but my mom's boyfriend from my early years took on that role. It's the best damn feeling until you have kids of your own. He's still "grandpa" to my kids.They want the list to result in denial. They use the fact that people on the list passed background checks as a reason to deny them. Denial based on the list would be a blatant due process violation.Blatantly unconstitutional. "nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"I support the Second Amendment, but here are a list of ways I don't. You hear this a lot with rights in general. "I support gay rights, but not gay marriage." "I support freedom of speech, but not 'hate speech'." No, you really don't support the right. &gt;Again, there isn't a precedent.

There is ample precedent for the unconstitutionality of infringing on a right without due process. In general, you have a right to be notified of actions against you, and to be heard and to challenge those actions. There are balances, with tests to be done, such as in Gilbert v. Homar where a guy was suspended from a position of public trust without a hearing because of an arrest. However, in that the court said the test of the "risk of an erroneous deprivation" was met, because the risk was non-existent since he was indeed arrested. With the list, the risk of erroneous deprivation has been shown to be very high, with the watch list known to be highly inaccurate. There is no way this would pass that test. 

That was just loss of property interest. Here we have a fundamental right violated. There is no hearing at all before the infringement, in fact not even notice of pending infringement, you find out long after the infringement at the moment you try to exercise the right (if you can, it's a secret list). There's not even a regular method by which to challenge the infringement after you find out. You can't just walk into an office and say "I'm John Smith, and the John Smith on the watch list is someone else" and have it fixed. No, your rights will be violated because you have a name similar to someone they suspect. Or you have a distant relative who lives with family where some cousin is suspect. Or you went to the wrong protest. Or you belong to some rights organization they don't like. 

&gt;Does due process even apply to people suspected of terror ties in this case? 

Of course it does when it relates to rights in this country. 300,000 people on that list have no known affiliation with any terrorist group. They're just on the list. 

&gt;It is entirely possible that the court would strike down such a law, it is also possible that they would affirm it.

If we had a law that said to line up all the gays and shoot them, do you think it would be struck down? You're saying we don't know because that exact case hasn't been before the Supreme Court yet. However, we have a lot of cases that say this wouldn't be found constitutional. 

This isn't some right-wing NRA thing. Even the ACLU is on board with opposition to the watch list. You can choose to have an abortion, but you can't choose not to be forcefully impregnated in the first place. It's truly disgusting. Bolt action .22 LR rifle. Inexpensive to buy, inexpensive to shoot, simple operation, lets you concentrate on the fundamentals of shooting. Used examples in good shape can be had for $150 or less. Later when you want something more you'll think of selling that first .22, but don't. That old first .22 tends to have sentimental value later, especially if you teach your eventual kids on it and hand it down. 

As far as "prepping," you can carry a lot of .22LR, and it becomes your varmint gun for anything up to raccoon reliably, bigger with a close head shot.  

And they get almost movie quiet with subsonic ammo and a suppressor. &gt;I merely pointed out that our constitutional law is rarely as simple as we think it should be.

Of course. But I am allowed to say something is blatantly unconstitutional based on precedent. 

&gt;the whole point is that the list is that it remains a secret

A secret list, known to be highly inaccurate, that you can't directly find out if you're on, or easily get yourself off of if you're innocent. Such a list should never have any influence regarding the rights of the people. The very concept should be patently offensive to any American. It may be grounds for the authorities to keep an eye out, but that's it. 

&gt;people suspected of terror ties

Remember, this just means being on a list, not necessarily suspected as an individual of terror ties. Almost 1/3 of the people on the list have no known relation to any terror group. You would also be denied for having the same name as someone on the list, which expands the affected people. It's just a huge data dump with no checks for validity. The whim of any number of people can put a name on it.  

&gt;Rather I think that people on the list should face increased scrutiny in the background check process (if they don't already)

The background check process checks for things that by law disqualify one from buying a gun, and these things have been done with due process (conviction, adjudicated mentally incompetent, etc.). If none of these due process things apply, then you pass the background check. Where does "Well, this person has the name of a person who's on a list for some reason that we don't really know" fit in?



Surprise, pro-rights group supports politicians who protect that right. I bet GLAAD tends to support politicians who protect gay rights. Color me shocked!This is the trade of the anti-gun people.

"You are three times as likely to be killed by a gun in the house than saved by one." The study was flawed in many ways, including requiring a kill of the assailant for the gun to have counted as protective use (most successful protective use is without a shot fired), studying a population already at high risk for gun violence, and counting the gun in the home even if it had nothing to do with the violence (grandpa's shotgun in the back closet while you get shot in a home invasion would have counted). It also puts the cart before the horse, someone buying a gun because he's already in danger from criminals, but gets shot anyway is sold as having the gun made the death more likely. The study also determined that renting the home and living alone each had a higher correlation to death by gunfire than simply owning a gun, but that's not in the press releases. 

"More likely to be killed by someone you know" is a good one, where "someone you know" includes rival gang members and the dealer or bookie you owe money to.

Both of the above make you think everybody in the country is in danger, when the average person who does not associate with criminals has far less risk. 

"Forty percent of guns don\u2019t go through background checks" This statistic is from a survey where most of the period covered is **before** the background check system was started in 1994. The survey also included gifts, and it included buying from family, something that has been exempt from all proposed universal background check laws. There were a few other errors I can't remember now. &gt;I think we can agree that a real person should spend an hour or two looking for a reason to deny the gun purchase

We already have a delay of up to three days in the case that a check is flagged but not outright denied. Reasons for denial are only based on due-process adjudicated facts, and the reasons will be in the record regardless of any watch list. So why would someone on the watch list warrant more of a check than anyone else? 

Remember, the Democrats are mad that people on the watch list acquired guns after **passing** a background check. There was no legal reason to deny the checks, because these people had done nothing wrong. However, the Democrats still want them denied. 

&gt;mistakes are made all the time because of errors due to a sheer number of requests.

The system is automated, so the request volume is irrelevant as long as the hardware can support it, and there's never been an indication that it can't. The system processed a record 185,000 checks on Black Friday, no problems. 

Mistakes mainly happen at the state level, where data is not properly, fully or timely fed into the system. The NRA and NSSF have been working with states to improve their reporting into the system. The NRA recently got a law passed in North Carolina that really tightened up that state's reporting. Laws like this only make government more efficient, don't harm law-abiding gun owners, so the Democrats really aren't interested in that kind of thing. Pocket knives. I can never keep one for more than a couple years, then it disappears. 

That and those black pens in the Army. I refuse to believe anyone who says he's actually used one from new to empty. It's like in the Hitchhiker's Guide, nobody who wants to be an HOA president should be allowed to be an HOA president. Citizens United didn't actually change much. Before the law that this overturned, there were other vehicles to funnel money to politicians. 

If you want obscene corruption, check out Tammany Hall. The greatest relatively unknown thing that FDR did was his role in destroying that organization. They don't like that old car on the grass but allow planters? Chop off the roof, car planter!Someone in government law enforcement must be pissed that the official definition of mass shooting, and the list of carefully confirmed ones, is rarely used by the press anymore. 
&gt;89 people die every single day from gun violence in the United States

Suicide by gun is not gun violence unless suicide by hanging is "rope violence" or by drugs is "pill violence." Gun accidents aren't gun violence unless a car accident is "car violence." The buck stops ... somewhere down there. &gt;Would a petty gang?

If guns were banned, most guns would end up in the hands of criminals, and then be in circulation among them for centuries. After that, remember that guns aren't really hard to make. The Sten submachinegun of WWII was designed to be made in bicycle shops using 1930s technology. 

The larger gangs will still acquire or make their weapons, and those will be sold downstream to smaller and smaller criminal groups. Banning guns puts even more power and money into the hands of organized crime, just like alcohol and later drug prohibition did. They'll talk about deaths and in the same sentence talk about their mass shooting list. It's purposefully disingenuous. 

Their list even includes people who weren't shot, where under 4 people were shot, and people who were shot with a BB gun. &gt;Fine. In 2013 there were 11,208 gun homicides.

Incorrect, [8,454](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2009-2013.xls). At least try to get correct numbers. 

&gt;this satire article is the way to go.

As far as causes of death go, opening up a doughnut chain would kill far more people. I may have been wrong, but your manner of speaking suggested a "but" rights supporter. So if you don't support the NRA, how about the SAF, GOA, a state rights organization like Calguns, or even Pink Pistols?Ah, relying on the old liberal "fake, but accurate" fallback? It's just another example of how correct facts are anathema to the anti-rights people. &gt;I'd rather just ask you if a police officer or federal agent knocked on your door and said he was there to take away your guns because the 2nd amendment suddenly ceased to exist, would you lash out violently or peacefully hand over your guns.

First, the right exists apart from to the amendment, which only seeks to limit the government's power to infringe upon the pre-existing right. 

But you do raise an interesting point. Most law-abiding people would probably give up their guns because they otherwise have lives that would be ruined by criminal conviction. All the criminals wouldn't because they are criminal. So guess who keeps their guns. 

As far as what I'll do, I'll tell you when that happens. Most likely "I don't have any guns officer" because none of them are registered, and several don't even have serial numbers. That's why we oppose registration. How are they to find them otherwise?&gt;Your correct facts don't change a thing, was my point. 

It brought the number down from the continually inflated numbers used by the anti-rights people. It showed his dishonesty. 

&gt;"Anti-rights people." Gimme a break. 

It's a right. They're against it. Anti-rights. Very simple. They are the same as the pro-lifers, just a different subject, and just as dishonest. &gt; After all, folks want solutions instead of meaningless platitudes. 

Call me when the Democrats propose a meaningful solution. &gt;Let's pretend they had a warrant to search your home.

Under what pretense? That's a pretty big pretend. In fact, in order to carry out this seizure they would have to commit mass violations of the 4th Amendment. But then, the anti-gun people have never cared about destroying other amendments to get at the 2nd. Case in point, using the terror watch list to deny firearm sales, violating 5th Amendment due process.

&gt;Or hell, you were even carrying one when you opened the door.

I'd really be that stupid knowing they're coming for guns? 

&gt;The purpose of this thought experiment is to determine whether or not you are a law abiding citizen

By hiding them, I wouldn't be a law abiding citizen. You created the fallacy of False dilemma. Of course, it is every citizen's duty to resist unjust laws. That's how we became a country in the first place. 

Another though experiment. Your government wants to remove all firearms, but to do that, it will need to violate the 1st, 4th and 5th Amendments. Are you willing to accept that mass violation to get at the one? Where? I don't see one. All but maybe the few absolute weakest centerfires, far below the level of the .223. Also, that deer rifle has about twice the power of the average AR-15.&gt;You mean the anti-choicers, right?

Exactly. Same agenda, same tactics.

&gt;Being mistaken (using faulty numbers) doesn't mean it's dishonesty

Continual use of faulty numbers does. 

&gt;And I can't wait for the country to finally have a real discussion about what the 2nd Amendment means.

We did, and it's the individual right to keep and bear arms. That is as intended from the beginning, and as is current jurisprudence. No founder of this country spoke against an individual right to keep and bear arms, and many framed the right as a necessity to combat an oppressive government. 

&gt;and certainly it wasn't intended to give gun rights to people on the terrorist watch list 

I see you are no fan of the 5th Amendment either. Let's see, we have a secret government list that is famously inaccurate, hundreds of bureaucrats are capable of putting your name on it for any reason, you aren't told when you're put on it, there's no simple way to correct your wrongful inclusion on the list, no way to differentiate you and someone else with your name, and your presence on the list prohibits you from exercising a right. That's a major 5th Amendment due process violation. 

&gt; And it's perpetuated by people who bicker over exact numbers and semantics

Words are important. Your side continually twists and distorts them to confuse people into following them. 

&gt;I'm not arguing with you any further on this though.

Facts suck. &gt;I would as long as it was specifically for the purposes of getting rid of firearms.

You are very scary. So, once it's established the government can violate any right it wants for a purpose, who's next? When the Republicans take power, shall we go after the gays? Why not? You've already established that constitutional protections can be waived if those in power want to. 

&gt;This is a major crisis our country is facing.

No, it isn't. The number of guns has been going way up while gun crime has steadily been going down. Concealed carry has more than tripled in ten years, while gun crime continues go to down. Statistically, a concealed carrier is less likely to commit a crime than a police officer. 

&gt;Unsure why the 1st and 5th amendments would need to be involved though.

To completely stop guns you need to stop them from being created. This means stopping the spread of plans, especially in regards to 3D printing of guns. As of now, everything but the barrel, firing pin and spring can be made in a 3D printer, and home CNC machines are becoming more commonplace, enabling complete fabrication. A ban on these plans is a 1st Amendment violation. 5th Amendment involves not having to tell the government you have guns. As of right now, the *only* people in the country who are legally exempt from gun registration are criminals, because that is a violation of the right to not self-incriminate. You need registration for confiscation to work so you know where to look. You would need to force people to self-incriminate. If you want to ban guns incrementally as is being done, you can start by banning people on various lists like the terror watch list, which is a 5th Amendment due process violation. 

&gt;Why won't you answer the question? All you needed to say was "No, I wouldn't kill the public employee and I would hand over my guns.

Because you presented a False dichotomy. There are other valid choices, such as "I don't have any guns." If previously registered, "I lost them." Aside from that, remember that legal self-defense against an illegal use of force applies even if the aggressor is a police officer. 

&gt;You value your firearms over people's lives.

No, I value my life and the lives of my family, which is a reason to keep firearms. My firearms have killed fewer people than Ted Kennedy's car. 

In reality, the vast majority of gun owners hurt nobody, but you want to punish them for the deeds of the tiny minority. That's a good idea, let's lock up all the gays because some are promiscuous and spread AIDS. Let's lock up all the Muslims because some minority promotes terrorism. You've already destroyed the Bill of Rights, so there's no problem here. 

&gt;your mindset is far too prevalent. 

Let's hope the mindset of individual freedom and rights stays prevalent. Again, your desire to destroy the Bill of Rights to attain your goal is downright scary.It isn't. &gt; This is the 355th mass shooting in the US this year

According to a certain definition designed to pump up the numbers, that includes people not killed by bullets, that has included BB guns, and that even includes the shooter killing himself. But their violent crime is through the roof, even if you don't count at that their police engage in massive underreporting of violent crime in order to make their stats look gook. &gt;You still aren't answering the question. 

I don't have to answer your fallacious question. But I may kill someone if necessary when they are in the process of violating my rights and endangering my family. Such is my right as a human being. Luckily, I have the means with which to exercise that right. 

Oh, I forgot, you don't think we have any rights. They can all be freely violated on your whim. Sorry, I meant it includes people not injured by bullets.Progressives will violate all other rights they claim to hold dear to get at the 2nd Amendment.Future confiscation. Criminals are constitutionally exempt from registration, but we have to register.That's how they initially banned pot. They required a tax stamp, then stopped issuing stamps.MexicoCar deaths are simply declining faster than firearm deaths. And you have to include suicides to get the firearm number that high.The guns were bought in California."GOP refuses Democrat calls to violate the 4th Amendment" works too.We did that once, but it had the side effect of transferring massive power and wealth to organized crime.I hope you realize that such trafficking is already a federal crime. In fact, a Californian who routinely goes to Arizona to buy handguns, then returns home to sell those guns to criminals, violates four different federal laws. He is engaged in gun selling without a license, he is lying on the purchase forms in Arizona saying the guns aren't for resale, he is buying a handgun across state lines without going through a home-state dealer, and he is knowingly selling guns to criminals.

Perhaps making this practice more illegaler should fix it! Make it five felonies instead of just four? That'll stop 'em!Muslim groups have at times reported those turning to violent fundamentalist involvement, and I wholeheartedly praise these great Americans. Unfortunately, some mosques preach it, many more are friendly to it, or at least turn a blind eye.Evil black guns, cosmetics modified to California law to make them look less evil.What little reporting there was, it was simply fact. It was not accompanied by numerous editorials and calls for political action as normally happens.Yeah, not close, MSNBC has much less news in relation to commentary.MSNBC is 85% opinion, Fox is 55%.It makes a nice statement. I wonder if the Democrats will notice this similarity in the respective anti-rights campaigns too.Don't call me boy, buddy.&gt; The fact that you can buy rocket launchers online.

Rockets are classified as destructive devices requiring a special form and background check that takes months for the ATF to process, a $200 tax paid to the ATF, and you must pick them up at a licensed Title II dealer. 

So where is this highly illegal operation you speak of?The sale can occur anywhere, but you still have to pick it up from a home-state FFL subject to your state's laws.We have such a myriad of laws that the average person commits crimes without realizing it. It does happen that in the effort to be friendly and helpful to police, people have been arrested after revealing they tripped up on one of these crimes. Your second one is a fireworks launcher, only legal because it can't accept grenades. Of course it can be modified. I can modify PVC pipe to be a rocket launcher.I wonder why the CDC, with a known anti-gun agenda, has higher numbers than the FBI.No, it's news you don't like. Both are biased news. One has more biased opinion than the other, and that's MSNBC.If you did that with a pistol, you committed a federal crime. &gt;The fact that you're openly and proudly stating

I proudly state that I would defend my family, as is my human right.

&gt;You have a deep rooted sickness 

Says the person who doesn't  believe we have any rights. 

&gt;You believe your inanimate object is of greater value than the life of another human being. 

You'd leave a wasteland of violated rights behind you in your crusade against this inanimate object. Hundreds of millions of people with their rights violated because you don't like guns. 

The guns have monetary value, some have sentimental value, but their main value is their utility to defend and feed my family. Yes, the lives of my family take precedence over the lives of strangers. I'm kind of selfish that way. Only as openly stated by people running the CDC,MSNBC does the same thing for its news, which is only 15% of its content. Both have opinion masquerading as fact. MSNBC has very little of even that. Articles like this also hurt those trying to ban guns incrementally. For every statement of "no one's taking your guns" there's someone who actually does want that to happen. I for one appreciate the honesty of the latter. I miss lawn darts.Both slant their news content. MSNBC has less of that news content than Fox, being mostly opinion. The only people who do **not** have to license or register their guns are criminals. How is that effective risk management?

Also, insurance doesn't cover criminal acts, so it would never pay out. You're just adding a financial burden to a right, like a poll tax. The guns were bought in California. 

&gt;buy an arsenal of weapons without so much as presenting an ID amiright??? 

It was a bolt-action .22LR, a common first gun for kids, and his mom was there for the sale. I find it interesting that they cut out all interaction with the private seller before actually paying for the gun. Freedom-loving people of the US, we win!

&gt;At what point do people wake up and say what the hell have we done this is no longer a civil society or a free one where we want to raise our kids. 

You are right. These anti-gun people are quite uncivil as they keep trying to diminish our freedom, and that's no place to raise our kids. Once you control for our [big city crime problem](http://www.citylab.com/politics/2013/01/gun-violence-us-cities-compared-deadliest-nations-world/4412/) we're actually doing fairly well. Before anyone says that's because that's where most of the people are, these largest cities are responsible for gun deaths in much higher numbers than the proportion of population they contain. The average shotgun is less strictly regulated (some are Title II arms, hard to get, highly regulated). This is because they account for a very tiny percentage of gun crime, and much less death than the number of people killed using hammers.&gt;These kinds of articles throw rational discussion out the window.

I like these articles, because most of the "rational discussion" is leading to the same end, just in a more sneaky, incremental manner. We don't want to ban guns, just these evil guns. Then these guns, then these guns. Create new classes of people who can't have guns, due process be damned. Now let's require registration. Registration is closed, no more new guns. Time for a forced buyback, Australia style like Clinton wantsI need to grind some horseshoes down to spiked ends. That could make for an interesting game, extra point for sticking the spikes. There's no careful aiming time in self defense, so forget that perfect hit with a .22 that will take someone down.

Semi-auto pistols in .380 and 9mm, and revolvers in .38 Special are very easy to handle unless you get an ultra lightweight gun, and they are generally effective enough. A Ruger LCP is more concealable than a Bersa Thunder, but the latter is much more easy to shoot, and much more accurate. On the revolver side, I hear a Ruger LCR in .38 Special is a very easy shoot despite its lightness, mainly because you can actually get a good grip on it (you barely get two fingers on the tiny semi-autos). 

&gt;And I'd imagine that 2-3 32ACP's or even 22LR's will do about as much damage as a single 9mm, or a 40s&amp;W would

Kinetic energy is both ways, Newton's law. Does it hurt your hand more to shoot ten rounds of .22, or two rounds of .40, from a similarly-weighted pistol? I can shoot .22 all day without pain, but I start to feel .45 pretty quick. Alternately, poke your friend with your finger a bunch of times. Now hit him with your fist once. Ask which hurt more. 

From all I've read though, simply showing the gun will make most criminals flee. Shooting it even if you don't hit takes care of most of the rest. If you actually hit, most will panic and run, freaking out because they've been shot. For these purposes, technically even a .22 will do. But that guy hopped up on painkillers who wants to kill you to get drug money may take some more kinetic energy convincing. 

And don't forget the four-legged predators. A large dog intent on killing you doesn't care much about your .22 LR. But that's a gun-free zone. And it works, see how those signs magically keep out the psychos?I think the way to play it without killing anything was according to the instructions. Wow, lots of people who know little about guns talking like they know about guns. They even brought out the "pistol grip makes it easier to hip fire, which is more dangerous" thing. My 40+ year old .22 LR rifle is an "assault weapon" in New Jersey. &gt;He did anything but; in his first year he signed a law overturning a ban on loaded and concealed guns in national parks in 2009. 

This was part of a larger bill that had so much support a veto would have been overridden. It would have been too politically damaging to veto the bill over that provision. His signing the law provides no evidence that Obama actually supported this provision. &gt;You've admitted you'd kill a guy or girl for doing their job.

If that person's job involves endangering my family, then of course I would. I would shoot a rapist for doing his job of attempting to rape a family member too. 

&gt;Chances are they are just as pro gun as you, but you'd kill them anyways.

If they are pro rights, then they will refuse to enforce an unconstitutional order. In fact, police in some states that have enacted strict gun laws have outright refused to enforce them. 

&gt;You're sick. Seek help. 

I just want to protect my family. You want to strip all Americans of their rights, not just gun rights, but all rights. I think you're sicker. 

There was one gun designed to hip fire, the Browning Automatic Rifle, and it had a regular stock. About the lowest you could comfortably go with a pistol grip is a chest-level fire, and it gets progressively worse the lower you go. &gt;A public employee taking away an inanimate object is not threatening your family

If you remove the means for protection, you threaten the family. The state has no legal obligation to protect my family.

&gt;given your violent nature

I've been in exactly one fist fight in my life, in grade school. I avoid violence when at all possible. 

&gt;statistical evidence pointing to the increased likelihood by death by firearm when a gun is in the home. 

Bad statistics. 

&gt;You support murder.

You support wholesale violation of civil rights. I think you're worse. &gt;Criminals can't buy them on the black market if they're registered

Pretty much by definition the black market will consist of unregistered and stolen guns. It will also be fed by straw buyers, who currently funnel thousands of guns to the criminal market every year, with only a handful of prosecutions. That's not a handful of convictions, the government only goes after maybe 60 or so a year. 

You can charge an otherwise law-abiding person for failing to register his guns, but what did you accomplish? He wasn't likely to ever commit a crime with his guns in the first place, so you must made a criminal out of a non-criminal through no action of his. You **cannot** charge a criminal for failure to register his guns, so what did the law accomplish for him? What crime did it deter?

&gt;In a year or two, the black market for guns dries up.

Just the guns currently in the black market can keep it going for decades. Most guns found with criminals have been in circulation in the criminal market for a very long time. That, plus it's getting ever easier to make them with modern equipment. A popular WWII submachine gun was designed to be made in bicycle shops using 1930s technology in five man-hours, so think of what we can do today for throwaway crime guns if needed. 

&gt;When was the last time you saw a brisk trade in reselling lost or stolen cars on the underground market.

The stolen car trade remains quite brisk. It is only this that keeps me from visiting DC.Does that mean you'll actually start prosecuting straw buyers in more than the token numbers under current law? Are you going to start concentrating efforts on known bad gun stores instead of harassing good ones over minor paperwork errors?So we have that rare Democrat who realizes that what they do to restrict guns is the same as what the Republicans do to restrict abortion? So you can be a 17 year-old formerly institutionalized convicted felon out on parole and buy a handgun now? I mean, if we're equalizing laws for the two things...Don't forget the .50 BMG ban. That's stopped exactly zero murders. Oh, and the "safe handgun" list that has been used as a tool to restrict the number of handguns available. &gt;Because the CDC is still banned from doing research on the underlying causes of gun violence.

No, they aren't. &gt;or to convert a low capacity magazine to a high capacity magazine with a few basic tools.

It's a box with a spring, not exactly rocket science. The PS90 is sold with 30-round magazines (capable of 50), limited to 10 rounds in California. A few minutes with a dremel increases the capacity again. &gt;onsidering over 90% of guns used in Mexico by criminals come from the U.S. 

Nope. Of all the weapons used by Mexican criminals, a relatively small percentage were confiscated. Of those guns, a minority were determined to be possibly of US origin. Of those that could be traced, 90% were of US origin. 

This is like saying I took a survey of mosques in America and determined that 100% of the people there were Muslim. Duh. My pre-selection guarantees the outcome.&gt;a winning strategy that will prevent mass shootings, ... \u201cThat work includes looking at the gun show loophole,

How many of our modern psychos have gotten their guns through private sales?&gt;Yet we don't hear of black-market cars being used for vehicular manslaughter

It's just not popular. They are generally used to aid other crimes as transportation, not threats. 

&gt;and I don't see "Straw Buyers" for cars  Why is that?

Because we don't prohibit felons from owning cars, there is no need for straw buying. Even people who have lost their license to drive can still legally buy cars, and even drive them on private property. I agree, with reservations. 17 year-old, with parental permission (18 full rights), prior institutionalized sure (if you're so much of a risk, why are we allowing you out?), and felons who have successfully petitioned to have their rights restored (parole over with clean record). Police work is, like, hard, man. &gt;And the moment the police find them where they don't belong, the car gets impounded

They are only prohibited from driving on public roads. Nothing prohibits the purchase or ownership of the car, so no reason for straw buyers. You asked, you have your answer. 

&gt;So, while IN THEORY they could legally buy a car without a licence, they sure couldn't drive it home, not having plates and all.

And this has what to do with your question of straw buyers? He can buy the car legally, that's all that matters. Your attempt at diversion has failed.&gt;Civil rights are privileges granted to you by the government

Sorry, meant human rights. The right to keep and bear arms exists outside of and prior to the 2nd Amendment, which only has as its purpose to explicitly identify this right and restrict the government from infringing upon it. 

&gt; If we are abusing these privileges, which in the case of the 2nd amendment we clearly are, it is our civic duty to ask the government to take away said privilege.

When a specific person has been convicted of a crime after due process, we do take away his privilege. We don't take it away from all the others who have committed no crime. We certainly don't violate all of his other rights in order to do so, as you propose. 

&gt;And no, that is not worse than advocating murdering government employees.

Our country was founded on the concept that freedom is more important than life, as so many gave theirs for it. 

&gt;Again: Seek help before you harm yourself, your family, or members of your community. 

Again, do not try to gain any position of influence. Your ideas are decidedly anti-freedom and un-American. Good job by Obama whose statements legitimately caused that fear. If it weren't for this authoritarian progressive agenda, gun rights would be a liberal value too. Hell, we might even be subsidizing guns for people who can't afford them. &gt;The right to keep and bear arms is not a human right, sorry.

Yes, it is. Every person has the right to defend his life and liberty, and the means to do so. 

&gt;You're saying you'd murder a public employee for trying to take your gun - you no longer deserve the privilege of owning a firearm. 

Saying you'd violate the rights of everyone in this country, you no longer deserve the privilege of living in this country. Go to China or Russia or North Korea, some place that has the kind of authoritarian government better matched to your ideals.

The hypocrisy, you abusing the 1st Amendment to try to eliminate the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 10th Amendment rights of everybody else. &gt;You're the one who has a thing for straw buyers.

You asked how straw buyers applies to cars. I showed how it doesn't because nobody in the country is prohibited from buying cars. A felon can buy a car, register it, and drive it on the road. A person without a license can buy a car and have it transported to his house. A felon can't buy a gun and have it transported to his house legally though, as purchase and possession are prohibited, thus the reason we have straw buyers. 

&gt;If the idea of being responsible enough to get a license, register your firearm, and get insurance isn't good enough

The problem is we know the the license and registration are a prelude to a ban. Then those who say they only want "common sense" measures now will reveal themselves to be those who want to ban them. 

As far as insurance goes, that's just an attempt at a poll tax. Nice try. 

&gt;Hey, let's have a state-program to insure owners of lever and bolt action rifles and revolvers for a nominal fee, since they're the lowest risk

Actually, "assault weapons" have lower risk than shotguns, while revolvers are used in far more crimes than both. Obviously you want the charges to follow your likes and dislikes, not actual risk. &gt;Read the UN's universal declaration of human rights. It does not include firearms.

It is not authoritative. It has no legal authority whatsoever in the United States. But if you want to go there: "Article 3. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person." You take away my guns, you take away my security, and violate my right. 

And let's take a look at what you want to violate, not just for guns, but for all rights in your crusade against guns, "Article 8. Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law."

And another one you want to violate, "Article 17. (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property."

&gt;You seem to think that you have the authority to declare what is and what isn't a human right

Those who founded my country did, and they recognized it to be one. 

&gt;The overwhelming majority of countries on this planet don't allow private firearm ownership - or at least not to the degree the USA does. 

The overwhelming majority of countries don't recognize gay marriage either. I guess we should get rid of that too. Nah, I think we're right, and they're wrong. We'll keep gay marriage, and gun rights.&gt;Let's not pretend guns are coming up from Mexico more than they are going into it.

I didn't say that. I just caught and corrected an erroneous, but oft repeated, claim. The problem is that this is practically a full-time job with the anti-gun people. 

&gt; Let's also not pretend that estimates can't be derived from a sample size i.e. We don't need to trace every gun in every hand of every Mexican criminal to determine that U.S. guns are going into Mexico.

You are not grasping the concept here. This wasn't 90% of a random sample. This was 90% of a sample already pre-selected as likely to fit the desired results. It's like asking only GLAAD members if we should have gay marriage, and using that to claim 100% of Americans are for gay marriage. 

&gt;My point remains, a gun ban in this country would significantly reduce gun crime, mass shootings, etc.

A gun ban aggressively enforced by a highly authoritarian state with few individual rights, yes, it would drastically reduce gun crime. I'd prefer to keep my freedom though. I'll take my trains late to avoid a Mussolini. &gt;The USA is a member of the United Nations, hate to break it to you. Our country endorses that declaration.

Irrelevant. It doesn't override our own laws. 

&gt;our security isn't being violated by taking away your gun. 

By law the government is not responsible for my security. Only, I am. So, yes, it would violate my security. 

&gt;Taking away your gun is not an arbitrary deprivation of property given the use of a firearm. 

You've arbitrarily decided I shouldn't have one, so yes, it is. 

&gt;Those who founded your country openly and proudly stated that what they declared to be rights could be changed through the amendment process.

Incorrect. They said the Constitution could be changed. Whether the 2nd Amendment exists, the right still remains. As I told you in the beginning, the 2nd, like the 1st, refers to a pre-existing right and prevents the government from infringing on it.&gt;Bullshit. No-one fucking banned your car, did they? 

There's no national movement to ban cars. There is a powerful and well-funded national movement to ban guns. Registration has been explicitly stated as a step in total confiscation by its proponents. It is logically also a required step, needed to identify the gun owners. The government has used similar measures before. Marijuana was legal, then the government instituted a tax, requiring a tax stamp. Then the government stopped issuing stamps, effectively banning the sale of marijuana. When the law started, there was nothing about a ban, but the ban nevertheless was instituted. 

Once a gun registry is in place, the ATF will logically be given control, and it will be given the ability to make rules regarding the registry. The first thing that will happen is that while certain guns will technically be for sale, the ATF will rule that they cannot be registered. This creates an effective ban on sales. More guns will be moved into this category, and eventually the registry will be closed. For example of the ATF using rulemaking to effect a ban, see what they tried with 855 green tip ammo. They have a proven history of arbitrary and capricious decisions. 

The next step is retroactive bans, such as for "assault weapons," and the registry will be used to confiscate those. You don't necessarily need a new law, just an ATF rule stating that "assault weapons" cannot be on the registry, and strike them. At this point, anybody who owns one owns an unregistered weapon, which will be confiscated.  Again, the prohibited weapons list will expand.

And all this requires is one well-crafted registration law, the rest can be done through executive fiat. All the while, not one criminal could be prosecuted for failure to register, only otherwise law-abiding people. 

&gt;Did you see the part where people who register their lever guns get access to a low-cost, state run insurance pool?

I thought you said revolvers get this benefit, where revolvers are quite popular for use in crimes, but "assault weapons" that are rarely used in crime won't. Remember, the old-time poll tax was only a couple dollars in today's money, but it was unconstitutional. Says the person who thinks an endorsement to a document written by some organization supersedes the US Constitution. Hint: It doesn't. Says the person who believes we can suspend constitutional rights in order to go after gun owners. 

You really belong in a dictatorship, it's more suited to your beliefs regarding freedom. What rock have you been under? There are anti-gun organizations all over. He was lucky enough to get a shot off before being killed by having his head repeatedly bashed against the concrete by a violent delinquent teen hood. However, just because he was involved in a famous self defense case doesn't mean he's any kind of hero. Our history is full of cases where those who showcased our rights were complete scumbags.&gt;I don't believe that it legally supersedes the US constitution

Good, you're coming around. Then our jurisprudence takes precedence, and guns are a natural human right. 

&gt; norms pushed forward through things like the the declaration have substantial effective, if not legal, power. 

We're talking about legal stuff here. If it has no legal power, it has no power. I would love that! Well, if my libertarianism didn't kick in. If you can't afford the safe storage, don't get a gun. &gt;You're crying wolf again. 

You're believing people who say they don't want to ban guns, when history shows they do. &gt;I could remove it completely from my post and it wouldn't alter my point.

Then why keep repeating one of the anti-gun movement's most famous False mantras? 

&gt;And that is an adorable saying. Unfortunately it won't add inches to your dick anymore than an AR stops a drone strike.

I think you missed the point. That wasn't about fighting. The level of authoritarianism necessary to successfully ban guns is Mussolini-level. I'd rather have the gun crime than accept that level of authoritarianism. 

&gt;But let's be real, citizens with assault rifles will not stop an actual military force.

That worked for us so well in Vietnam, and we basically lost in Iraq and Afghanistan too. If 10% of gun owners fought, that's almost ten million against a million-strong armed forces, half of which would defect to the civilians anyway, taking their equipment with them. Big bombs would be useless, since a government that engaged in such mass destruction would quickly lose any popular support. 

Did you notice that yours is an argument for more availability of more powerful guns in civilian hands? We can't resist with only "assault weapons"? Well, then we need full-auto assault rifles and crew-served machine guns. 

&gt;I just wish more gun owners were honest.

I just us to be left alone to buy and use what we want. If I commit some violent crime, sure, take my guns, my own act caused my troubles. But otherwise, leave me alone. Funny though, I don't even like these weapons they want to ban now. The only "assault weapon" I own is an old tube-fed .22LR. I don't even have anything with a 10-round detachable magazine. But definitions tend to creep, and over time more and more of my guns will probably meet the criteria for some ban. We've seen it happen.

Not going Godwin, but the concept of Niem\u00f6ller's poem is definitely applicable here, "First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out -- Because I was not a Socialist. ... Then they came for me -- and there was no one left to speak for me."
&gt;So you'd agree that if the second amendment was amended to prevent you from owning a firearm, you would acknowledge the law and forfeit your gun?

We then would be left in an awkward situation with an amendment that violates a basic human right established in the beginning of our country. They did something similar with Prohibition, and there was massive public disobedience to the law, and it even created the modern powerful organized crime system. Eventually we realized how much of a mistake it was. And that was just with alcohol, not a fundamental right. 

So, what other rights do you still plan to violate in your pursuit against gun ownership?&gt; It just would feel more internally consistent if that is what they pushed. 

They have admitted a push for an outright ban now is politically impractical, even just for handguns. That is why they are using the incremental approach. &gt;Listening to the crazy outliers isn't a basis for effective policymaking, however.

This is mainstream. 

&gt;I don't think you'll ever see a better deal than, "You say you're a
