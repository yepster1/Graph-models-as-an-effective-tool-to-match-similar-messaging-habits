You really don't know your fellow travellers all that well, my dear YetiEater. The entire shy Tory phenomenon is a direct result of this type of behaviour from the left. And whilst there are certainly many on the left who are principled, decent and intelligent, there are sadly many, many, many more who think that all Tories are scum and that one should go to a great deal of effort to cause as much disruption, distress and general unpleasantness as possible to them. As in "Wanna [cyber](http://smg.photobucket.com/user/aquatics64/media/revengecybermen-1.jpg.html)?"?Dude, he just disagrees with you. Get a grip.No, no, you don't understand! It isn't hypocrisy when *[Labour](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1445761/Abbott-told-ex-husband-to-be-quiet-over-school.html)* members do it, only when *other* party's members do it!Short answer? Not so long as they expect the South to subsidise the rest of the country because of higher incomes whilst ignoring that higher living costs in the South often mean elsewhere people have more disposable income. Issues like Trident are less regionally important as people all across the country understand the issues. 500 extra party members (probably students?) in Winchester simply isn't going to cut it. &gt; Men do primarily hold power still.

But earn that power to impress women and they wield that power on behalf of women. 

&gt; I think its pretty obvious that our society or rather positions of power in our society are predominantly held by men

And this will remain the case so long as women judge men according to their status. Men simply have a higher drive to succeed despite all the obstacles and biases put in their way throughout the entire academic system. Equally though it remains irrelevant who actually holds the power and matters only on whose behalf the power is wielded. &gt; These people are living in an impoverished, crime ridden country in the middle of the Carribbean because our ancestors dumped their ancestors over there and forced them to work

I think you are misattributing the reason Jamaica is impoverished and crime ridden. That's one way of looking at it. Another and [more accurate](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurie_Rudman/publication/8226295_Gender_differences_in_automatic_in-group_bias_why_do_women_like_women_more_than_men_like_men/links/0a85e5324b69af209e000000.pdf) way would be that they are [suckers](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=White+Knight) for doing so. That the people living there have adopted such a culture. Good retort. I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing with regard to shy Tories though as I'd label what you describe above as reluctant Tories as distinct from shy Tories. And whilst the bullying element is less prevalent in normal life than online, it is sadly still all to frequent as we saw following the election results. As you say though, not all leftists are like that and most are pretty decent in their day to day lives even if they would be happy to see my up against the wall when the revolution comes! 

Also, and I don't mean this to sound pejorative, but have you considered that One Nation Toryism may actually be closer to your ethical position on sacrificing a little bit for the common good than Corbynism?  Personally I'm no fan of Cameron's Conservatism and prefer the Thatcherite brand of right wing politics where more emphasis is put on social mobility, meritocracy and the state taking less from those who do well (whilst encouraging and incentivising philanthropy) but aside from the need to put the economy first because of the perilous state of the global and domestic financial markets, the "little bit for the common good" attitude you espouse seems a far cry from the "until the pips squeak" attitude of the current Labour leadership and far closer to the Tories compassionate conservatism that Cameron would like to see.Just wanted to say I'm really happy for you and proud that you've not compromised despite pressure to conform. Your son won't get made fun of and hopefully in 10-20 years people will recognise how obscene it is to lop off parts of children's bodies for aesthetic reasons and not be doing it any more. But you are at the vanguard of that and it is thanks to you and people like you that fewer children of both sexes, not just boys, will be subject to genital mutilation as it becomes increasingly unacceptable to do so.People didn't just abandon their original cultures just because they became slaves. But freed of the shackles of slavery each individual is free to go their own way and some turned to crime and corruption whilst others did not. You are unfortunately correct. It stems from women and men behaving differently. Women have an innate in group bias towards other women. But men have an innate out group bias towards women. Women experiencing their own bias think that men are the same as them i.e. with an in group bias. Men experiencing their own bias think that women are the same as them i.e. with an out group bias. This leads to all sorts of misassumptions and injustices as women think that when men have power they use it for themselves and men think that when women have power they don't. 

I try to look at this state of affairs as objectively as possible but there is no denying that there is an intrinsic adversarial element to things as a result of these differences. This is horrific but I think a sensible conversation needs to be had about why parents of BOTH sexes kill their children and what can be done to prevent it. Are there different motivations based on gender? I expect there probably are and that some will be easier to prevent than others as a result. But at the moment it isn't even possible to have the debate or conversation about mothers who kill their kids without feminists sabotaging it with cries of "men kill their kids too!"That's great! Unfortunately though not everyone shares your experience and the most common feedback I've had when asking about such matters has generally been otherwise. But it is good to know that inroads are being made and it isn't the norm for everyone. They most certainly did not abandon their cultures, I don't know where you get that from, although they often ended up adopting a more homogenised culture to take account of their exposure to wider cultures in order to get along with them. But this is the opposite of destroying those elements that make a culture "cohesive and generationally contiguous" as they are adapting precisely to be more cohesive. 

&gt; criminology is not as simple as deciding to be a criminal and/or corrupt or not. You should know this.

Bottom line is it is that simple, but you are right that there is more to it than that, ranging from survival needs to examples set. Still, it is naive in the extreme to argue that cultures cannot be improved to reduce crime and corruption.It depends on the cost, but in principle very much so. Too often the road to Hell is paved with good intentions and I suspect that this may well be one such instance.It wasn't destroyed though is my point, it was either retained or adapted. Heh! A pragmatic idealist! ;-)The only reason it makes sense for non-married men to be ending relationships is overwhelmingly disproportionate unhappiness compared to their partners. Otherwise the Women Are Wonderful Effect should mean that most non-married breakups are instigated by the woman. Women must be treating men really, REALLY badly for men to be ending non-married relationships at equal rates to women.No. I wasn't referring to financial cost though, perhaps that's why it may have seemed so?Oh, elements must be changed or hidden in some cases, certainly, but it clearly does survive in many cases as we can see from present day Africa. Why?[Ronnie 'Fockin' Pickering!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQd005J4qA8)&gt; I wanna scrap trident, but I wanna replace it with something cheaper and more effective. 

There *is* nothing cheaper and more effective. That is why we have Trident. There is cheaper and *less* effective or more expensive and more effective but not cheaper and more effective.Anyone not being pedantic knew what you meant. &gt; No it wouldn't.

Yes, it would. It would take at an absolute minimum a period of years to start from scratch assuming that we have the existing technology, resources and knowledge to do so without needing to negotiate for them. Your six months for Japan nonsense is patently unTrue.

&gt; The USA makes and supplies the missiles. If they want to block them they can, just like France did with Argentina in the Falklands War.

The US cannot 'block' them. All it could do is cease providing support which would mean they'd require a new guidance system. But there is no reason to believe that this would ever happen and should it ever become a strategic risk in the future the UK would look to alternative options.Your third point is a good one, neither men nor women care about men's suffering and change will only come about when women are subject to the same hardships as men. [It is still True.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trident-alternatives-review) I *wasn't* referring to a financial cost, although there would doubtless be one. The kind of change I'd be imagining would be one where [women being treated as equals with men wouldn't result in both sexes thinking women were experiencing sexism](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/6958/Yeung_Amy.pdf?sequence=1).You do know that [not all slaves went to the Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Africa#Extent_of_slavery), right? And that slavery in Africa continues to the present day so we can see that cultures haven't been destroyed?If attempts at unification were entered into voluntarily and uncoerced then they wouldn't keep being blocked.It's not misleading. Anyone looking at it knows what it means. That is brilliantly put, even without getting into shared beliefs/values, comfort with the familiar/change being unsettling and harmony being an intrinsic good. I have no idea what you just said. &gt; I just wish he'd use his skills for good ;)

He does ;-)Unification has very much been coerced. Look at the bribery and blackmail that Ireland experienced after voting No. At least they actually had a referendum though. The UK hasn't since entering the Common Market and were lied to about what doing so meant. Representative democracy is the excuse used to prevent the people from being given a say. You think slaves that ended up in Jamaica are somehow different to other slaves? I think it reasonable to extrapolate, so if so we'll have to agree to disagree.No offence but only someone with no knowledge of politics, demographics or how to read data wouldn't understand that the data posted says that most Muslims support Labour and not that most Labour supporters are Muslims. Whether this is a "massive portion" or not remains up for debate but it's demonstrably not misleading by stating categorically what it refers to.No, we're going with "it is in no way ambiguous what the data shows, even taking into account the context of the prior discussion".I see your arguments are as logical and as carefully constructed as ever, SW_Faulty! How will I ever defeat them? ;-)And even if they did there are other guidance systems that could be used. It really is a non issue. He's not right wing at all, he's a centrist both socially and economically. Probably even more so than BoJo. May is the closest thing the Tory front bench has to a right winger at the moment and she's only got an outside chance.He's good at preaching to the converted but that's about it. He misrepresents the cause of the global recession by blaming it on the greed of bankers rather than the left-wing political drive to give homes to people who couldn't afford them in the States. He misrepresents that in work benefits for the low paid have driven up the cost of living for them. And he misrepresents the economy by emphasising that debt has increased under Osborne when the reason it has is because the deficit hasn't been cut hard or fast enough so that the very people he is preaching to don't have their quality of life reduced too far too fast.

He goes on to preach the politics of envy and hypocritically rails against austerity (after stating that the debt has grown under Osborne as a negative). He may be a conviction politician, but his convictions are too often naive and foolish for him to be taken seriously as anything other than a back bencher. How you or anyone else can take this man seriously is frankly worrying.*would *have*

No doubt you are correct though. When False accusations are shown time and time again to be used as weapons against innocent people it can't help but cast doubt on real victims too. Women need to stop lying about rape. It's an awful, awful thing to do. The overall aim is to smear the woman that Falsely accused Lord Brittan for having done so.It's moronic. Stupid, in fact. Only an idiot would do it. &gt; they're restricting information that they're worried might lead to people forming a different opinion

You are aware that this has *always* been the aim of political correctness, right?The cause was politically motivated lending via Fanny and Freddy to people who weren't ever going to be able to repay but would be more likely to vote Democrat as a result of being leant the money. Sure enough, when they all defaulted the oversupply of housing caused prices to plummet leading to the global recession. It had literally nothing to do with bankers greed or deregulation and this is objectively the case. Can you amend your editing? At the moment it looks like this:

     He misrepresents the cause of the global recession by blaming it on the greed of bankers rather than the left-wing political driv



Rather than this:

&gt;He misrepresents the cause of the global recession by blaming it on the greed of bankers rather than the left-wing political driv

It had nothing to do with bankers, who were quite happily asset stripping and engaging in other nefarious practices for their ill gotten gains. This wasn't even bankers, it was government. Politically motivated lending.Well obvious cultures diverge over time, but the same could be said of two neighbouring villages in Africa. The point I was making that cultural practices were continued (and in many cases that's all the slaves had to cling to).You're typing this on your phone, aren't you? Know how I can tell? 

&gt;  neighbouring *videos*?

It is certainly comparable and in many cases local divergence may be greater as a result of tribalism or other conflicts than more distant divergence where people stay Truer to their roots (as the various Jewish diasporas have shown). &gt; Giving the hapless mortgages so it would inevitably fail and then be shunted onto the taxpayer was done deliberately so that the system didn't fail.

Except it wasn't and wouldn't have been. Even assuming banks do require exponential rising debt, this would have looked like a dead end to them in those terms. Indeed, that is why despite deregulation in the UK it didn't happen here. Banks took other risks to remain competitive with the on-paper projected profits from the US but they tended not to outright deliberately set themselves up to fail like Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac. There were other factors that came into play, True, but there *was* a single cause and this was it and it isn't exaggerating to say so. Kudos for honesty!

I'm not talking about micro level effects though. Doubtless in many cases you are right that culture was significantly affected. But at the same time many made great efforts and great sacrifices to preserve heritage, language, culture, etc.You don't remember the 200~~6~~*5* general election where it literally wasn't possible to talk about immigration as an issue without being labelled a racist?

Edit: The year.We don't have the same mechanisms here for it to happen. Lending here is still based on ability to repay. And our bubble did burst in 2008. Prices have since corrected based on supply and demand. There is no bubble now. The only issue we face is affordability when interest rates finally rise.Because that was her motive.My ex had body confidence issues. I tried to get her to see how she looked in reality but she just seemed unable to accept it. One day she was laying on the bed with the light streaming in from the window and her silhouette clearly visible through the thin sheet. She looked perfect and I took a quick shot just with my phone camera. When I showed it to her she almost couldn't believe that it was her and literally cried with happiness. Had she not liked it she could have deleted it but this was the only way she was able to see what I saw.We don't have an historically average interest rate though and aren't projected to for the duration of the average mortgage length. Indeed, interest rates will continue to be kept low *because* of the impact a raise would have on the economy due to affordability of mortgage repayments. Almost certainly Chelsea. They'd made a previous bid too apparently.I don't think it is a cultural thing, it is more to do with the individual's perception. Some people are more pragmatic, others are less so. It's the same with sexual violence. Some will react to it the same as any other violence, others won't. You hurt my brain![Lucky for us](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2552066-chelsea-transfer-news-huge-anthony-martial-bid-revealed-latest-rumours) he was a man of taste![Not a rare thing at all](http://www.avoiceformalestudents.com/avfms-mega-post-10-reasons-False-rape-accusations-are-common/) either unfortunately. The public only ever tends to hear about it when there is not only enough evidence to prosecute but that the case is so heinous authorities cannot get away with taking no action.&gt; Of course there was rebellion, and cultural expression, but it was significantly different from that of where they came from.

In some cases it was more different than others, no doubt, but I think we're actually almost in agreement - just coming at it from different sides with me emphasising what was kept and you emphasising what was lost. I don't disagree that a great deal was lost. Multiple generations away from home and having their culture suppressed will inevitably do that. But as you've agreed efforts were made to preserve or adapt culture too and that's what I was talking about. Yet she didn't claim that a Labour peer raped her in 1967, did she?I'm not going to humour you this time, Etchy. Supply and Demand dictate that prices will continue to rise as interest rates remain low based on lending criteria banks have used for mortgaging and the current state of the UK and global economies. Even China's recent dip hasn't led to mass pulling out of prime London. There simply isn't a housing bubble and prices will continue to rise before they inevitably fall again at some point in the relatively distant future. Who can say? But being that no other serious bidders were reported and they are one of the few clubs that had the means to offer more they are definitely the most likely candidates. A bubble implies that prices are higher than they should be and a correction is due. This is not the case. And it would take a significant rise in interest rates to have a major effect on repossession rates and with a gradualist Bank of England and government doubtless stepping in if this were to present a real risk what you describe simply isn't a possibility. As such, referring to house prices being a bubble is at best disingenuous and at worst outright wrong. That is a good point. Even so, parents passed things down to their children and even grown ups from other parts of Africa will have taught their culture to youngsters they encountered where possible. 

&gt; how can you possibly be placing an emphasis on what was culturally preserved?

The glass is half full.You say bubble. I say high demand and limited supply. House prices will eventually fall, but there won't be another 2008 where values dropped by a third in a year.The mean is history. The population has risen by exponentially more than housing stock. Demand is now permanently higher. If UK house prices ever drop to 30% of current rates it'll be London being hit by a nuclear bomb!Ha! But I'm sure you can figure out which button is next to the 6 on a keyboard and which if it had been pressed would have accurately referred to a year than an election was held in though, right? ;-)Things return to the mean when everything else remains equal. That isn't the case here.That isn't the only change, although obviously it is a significant one. Supply and Demand is another. As is globalisation and the use of London property as a savings mechanism for the global elite. Things have moved on too far to ever go back to the way they were. This is the new reality. You can either keep trying to live in the past or accept this.Normally one would expect an attempted refutation of this type to be accompanied by some sort of logical argument or evidential proof. Before attempting to do so, I'd suggest reading [this](http://spectator.org/articles/42211/True-origins-financial-crisis).There is [already](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/300000-extra-homes-need-to-be-built-every-year-to-curb-housing-crisis-urges-report-8227467.html) too much [housing](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/20/uk-double-number-new-homes-300000-vince-cable)? The [facts](http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article50421.html) say [otherwise](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/social-reform/housing-supply-and-demand/).Culture influences but that doesn't mean that two people from the same culture will have the same reaction to the same level of sexual violence. Similarly two people from vastly differing cultures may have remarkably similar reactions to sexual violence. And the same holds True for other forms of violence too no doubt.Repeatedly drawing that parallel doesn't make it valid. There are too many things to list that explain why things are different ranging from the essential and immutable nature of housing to the constraints on addressing the underlying supply and demand issues. And honestly you shouldn't need me to explain that to you.&gt; What demand?

[This](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/2758/economics/uk-population-forecasts/) demand.

&gt; Have wages gone up in line with housing inflation?

If they had housing wouldn't be more expensive. [But it is](http://www.mortgageguideuk.co.uk/housing/uk-house-price-index.html).If ability to pay falls as interest rates rise then prices will fall too, but they won't tumble like they did in 2007/08 because we're not experiencing a bubble. The permanent state of affairs now is that housing costs proportionately more than it used to. [We don't serve their kind here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUy1z-mnoIU)Did you read point 8 in the link provided above? Other planets have little aliens called "crater farmers" that take pride in crafting a variety of attractive and appealing craters across the surface. Unfortunately humankind killed off Earth's crater farmers during the [Great Crater Wars](http://paleo.cc/ce/craters.htm) and now we only have a few left :-(It depends upon your definition.Even the legal one [has it's problems](https://www.crimeline.info/uploads/cases/2012ewcacrim2559.pdf). That it may or may not be rarer than actual rape and we have no way of knowing. Again, it depends on definitions. Is it a False accusation if someone doesn't identify a perpetrator, for example? Certainly rapes involving violence are (fortunately) exceedingly rare and rapes involving alcohol and regret are (unfortunately) exceedingly common. The only possible answer is that there is no way to tell and whatever answer you reach depends on the definitions used.Physical force, blackmail, coercion, etc.Again fortunately, most False accusations don't make it as far as court.By a significant magnitude I'd have thought. Necessarily so according to the current legal definition.The [Kanin study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#Kanin_.281994.29) is actually one of the better studies in this area of research, although the sample size is rather small. It gets singled out by partisans who don't like the result it yielded yet they ignore the shortcomings of the [US Dept of Justice 1997](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape#Rumney_.282006.29) data because that gives a lower figure. Your attempt to ad hominem Paul Elam rather than address the arguments posited in the linked piece says enough about your objectivity that I won't bother trying to persuade you of the inadequacies of your position. Suffice to say that if and only if you can refute the arguments and evidence will your opinion be worthy of consideration. Those were resultant effects that exacerbated matters though, not causes. Had the political lending not been pushed the rest wouldn't have followed. There is a massive difference between launching a ship and riding along in it's wake, after all.We were specifically talking about rapes involving violence not all rapes, and False accusations not False reports.

Looking at the numbers prosecuted for rape in relation to the number of convictions and weighing this against the number of False accusations prosecuted and convicted the only logical extrapolation is that [large numbers of reported rapes are False](http://www.avoiceformalestudents.com/avfms-mega-post-10-reasons-False-rape-accusations-are-common/) and certainly there are larger numbers of False accusations than there are rapes involving violence (something like 90% of rapes are non-violent, impaired or statutory).

Hardly. Clegg got ripped to shreds for compromising on issues he needed to as the minority in a coalition. Corbyn doesn't need to compromise at all and is being given all the slack in the world to do so. Pointing this out seems not only valid but just.Free trade. Optional political union. A multi-tier EU where every state is happy with it's level of involvement. What is so hard about that?There are distinctions but they make this hypocrisy worse, not better. Corbyn isn't in a coalition, he isn't in power, he doesn't face anything like the same pressure to make these compromises yet he has as much as admitted by his actions that his entire career has been a waste if he is so prepared to compromise now that he doesn't have to do so, but given a whiff of potential real power, his principles are quietly shuffled to one side and his supporters claim he is statesmanlike and pragmatic for being a far, far lesser man than Nick Clegg. Corbyn's political career did not begin with his election as Labour leader. He has spent three decades espousing positions that he has reneged on since running for/becoming leader. Ha! That would be good if he didn't spend so much time actually hanging around people who loathe regardless of whether he is with them or not.Now why did you go and have to stamp on the young lad's dreams with the brutal boot of reality like that? ;-)Were it ever to become a strategic risk it would be. But that isn't likely to ever happen and so it is unnecessary and superfluous.No, getting caught with hookers and blow did.It'll split along party lines for the most part and whilst Labour has more supporters in London the Conservative supporters are the ones that vote more. I suspect it'll be closer than Tories would like, especially as Khan talks a decent talk, but Zac should still pip it.I'd hope so but be concerned that most London Greens are watermelons...It's an honorary surname.TRP is not representative of how men speak though and the subreddit itself has far more neophytes attempting to be bro's than experienced contributors. Whilst the language used does aid understanding *for men*, it also deliberately provokes and antagonizes those politically or ideologically opposed to men being able to improve their understanding of how female attraction works. It's more to offend the sensibilities of those who would rather keep the wool over men's eyes than to attract attention. TRP isn't proselytising even if individual TRPers are. And the language used there does serve a purpose in aiding understanding even if it is only achieved at a cost. Also, many guys do actually talk like bro's, unfortunately. "Is divorce worth it for women? - The benefits of divorce go mostly to women"He's made a couple of half-hearted concessions but it is too little too late. He'd rather rail against those in power than compromise enough to actually get into power to fix the problems himself when he knows that the idealistic but unrealistic solutions he proposes won't work. Brown, Miliband, Corbyn, it's like Labour are doing what the Tories did with their awful leaders in the late 90s and 00s. &gt; is it really that suprising that I dislike a group of people who think they are superior to me?

They don't think they are superior to you. If anything they think you (as a woman) have been superior to them and TRP represents a way for them to get you off the pedestal and see you as you really are, warts and all, but on an equal playing field. 

&gt; Am I supposed to like a group of people who see little worth in me beyond being something to fuck?

They don't see you just as something to fuck either. They see you as a person and may like you or dislike you irrespective of whether they find you attractive or not. But, they don't let you hold the power of their attraction for you over them. That's the only difference between TRPers and non-TRPers.

&gt; Why should I feel anything but contempt for a group of people who distort the truth in order to make women look bad?

They don't distort the truth and they don't make you look bad. They pull the mask off and demonstrate how female attraction really works. The reality does make women look bad to a degree but TRP explicitly states not to blame women for their nature and that getting angry about it is beta. 

&gt; That stuff you say hurts. Not in a 'the truth hurts' sort of way, but in the way it hurts when you find out that your friend was talking bad about you behind your back.

It's more like a friend who betrays your most shameful secret way rather than someone making stuff up about you way.

&gt; I thought you guys liked us.

The whole reason TRP exists is to help guys get with women. We very much do like you. If we didn't TRP wouldn't be a thing. TRP isn't about hating women or even disliking women, it is about getting closer to women and maintaining their attraction. Hardly the behavior of those who don't like women.

&gt; Isn't reasonable for me to dislike you?

No, it isn't reasonable at all. It's like a Redneck hating all Muslims because of 9/11. You outrageous flirt, you! ;-)He's not saying the commercial is about height, he's saying that society treats short people the same way the kids are treated in the commercial (and he's right).&gt; They tell me directly that they think they are superior to me. 

If they thought they were superior they wouldn't need to say it. It sounds like an attempt to maintain frame and assert themselves gone wrong. That said it could also have been that they felt they were superior because they grasped why TRP was correct and you do not. Still, pretty pointless stating it to you either way.

&gt; They say that they only view me as something to fuck. Am I not supposed to believe what they tell me directly? 

I assume you are talking about Internet comments here? It sounds like they were saying that they don't regard you as an individual as someone worthy of more than that rather than you as a woman as someone worthy of more than that. TRP is amoral about this issue and a non TRPer may well hold the same views just as another TRPer may well hold different views.

&gt; There are things in the sidebar that are blatantly non-factual. They exaggerate the truth or flat out lie to make women look bad. Do you need me to link examples? 

If you want to you can and I'll happily discuss them with you but I get the impression you are referring to rhetorical devices to make a point. Still, if you want to point to specifics we can look at specifics. 

&gt; You don't have to believe me but I know for a fact that I am not, 'disgusted by the majority of the male population'. I know for a fact that I do not categorize men into AF/BB. I don't view men that way. It's just not True. 

Everyone categorises people into those they are attracted to and those they are not. Everyone. Including you. Saying otherwise either means your lying (perhaps even to yourself) or you haven't understood what this point is saying (and from your response above  I suspect it is the latter).

&gt; They just want to fuck us. They still view us with contempt, but they want to have sex. That's the only reason why they bother with all of this. I'm not making this up or projecting. This is what they say themselves. 

Do you know how men want to be loved? And that they can't be? Because of this some are frustrated and go through the anger phase saying nasty things. Life isn't fair but it doesn't change what men want, only what they can have. Men don't just want to fuck women or view them with contempt, even if that's what they say. 

&gt; You are the 9/11 muslims though, or at least you defend them.

No, men who treat women like assholes are. TRP just want their same level of success. The asshole part is irrelevant. &gt; Here are the poverty rates just for industrial nations taken from this source I'm sure it is even worse for poor countries. Just to be clear, I don't think women are oppressed in these countries or anything ridiculous like that. I just don't get why TRP would say something that is blatantly unTrue. 

Semantics. It's to do with spending power that women in relationships with men have in relation to the men in those relationships.

&gt; Does anyone really believe this [women also stop maturing at around the age of eighteen]? Of course this isn't True. 

This is an argument about accountability and responsibility that many women, particularly attractive women, do not have to face. It isn't meant to be taken absolutely literally.

&gt; It's just not True that women only fuck the top 20% of men. 

No one said it was. What was said was that women want to fuck the top 20% of men. Those outside that top 20% have to put in a disproportionate amount of effort to achieve anything like approaching the same result.

&gt; The highest percentage I could find anywhere was 80%. The author just tacked on another 10% to make his/her argument seem stronger. 

Most stats I've seen indicate between 2/3 and 3/4 divorces are initiated by women, but I suspect that the citation was just a lazy and inaccurate way of saying "the vast majority".

&gt; So I shouldn't believe what men tell me? Does that include yourself? 

Of course not, you should absolutely believe everything you read on the Internet! ;-) Seriously though, men who claim to be Red Pill yet still hold women in contempt are like kids who say they have a black belt after watching a Jackie Chan movie.

If the boycott movement also targeted these worse regimes they'd legitimately be able to make a case for not being Anti-Semitic. But instead they excuse other regimes that do far worse than Israel and single Israel out for their opprobrium. They may genuinely care for the Palestinian people and hold their position out of humanitarian conscience but the lack of consistency in applying their humanitarian conscience marks them out for the anti-Semites they are.Just wanted to say that you are constructively contributing and that many others will recognise this and upvote you for doing so. The only people downvoting you are anti-Semites who want to censor any disagreement so that their hypocrisy remains hidden. Spitting at someone is assault. It's also incitement to violence. I'm actually surprised that you'd defend it.Then how do you explain the terrorist attacks and attempted attacks? How do you explain the existence of groups like Hizb ut Tahrir? How do you explain the popularity of the various hate preachers from Anjem Choudray to Abu Hamza?

Islamism is sadly a very real thing in Britain. It may still be a minority of British Muslims that hold such views but it is a disappointing large minority. It's valid though. When a protest changes from voicing objection to assault, intimidation, violence, etc. then charges of fascism are not only warranted they are necessary.Sure, if you don't make excuses for the states with a far worse human rights record.

If anything the opposite is True and efforts to increase diversity mean that systems of power disadvantage whites at the expense of non-whites. When those in apparent power are guilt tripped or feel morally obligated to use their power for the benefit of others rather than their own group the stance that Chalabi takes not only reinforces and excuses the more significant racism that exists in society but further entrenches the divide. There is nothing 'positive' about discrimination. And non-whites are over-represented in the areas you listed in relation to the rates they apply. &gt; When you say "those in apparent power are guilt tripped or feel morally obligated to use their power for the benefit of others rather than their own group" that does seem to imply that if weren't for moral/legal obligations then white people would use their power to benefit "their own group"

Or not to it to benefit any group.

&gt; I assume you do agree that political correctness and anti-discrimination laws are necessary, otherwise the systems of power would unfairly favour white people?

No and no, they wouldn't favour any groups.

&gt; what do you mean when you say these things "reinforces and excuse the more significant racism that exists in society" and "further entrenches the divide"?

The resentment between races based upon the mistaken assumption that the white majority are intentionally and actively discriminating against the non white minority. 

&gt; What is your alternative, surely the legal and societal pressures not to be racist are better than the alternative of not having them?

The alternative is to do away with political correctness and have people treat each other as people rather than members of a group identity. No, that's not why marriages die and there is no sexual attraction. That occurs in part through over familiarity for it's own sake and part through lack of effort in maintaining mystique, allure and sex appeal during marriage as a result of that over familiarity. Ronnie Fockin Pickering!Bull. If this was posted about any other demographic whatsoever the police would have got involved a lot sooner and a lot more seriously. "All black women should be killed" would get you a visit from the police a lot more quickly than this hypocrite received. **safe*, not same.Defamation, incitement, "Fire" in a crowded theatre, etc.Context matters in every case, but let's not pretend that this isn't an entirely hypocritical "It's okay to say this about group X but nor about group Y" scenario.&gt; So you reject the findings that people unconsciously favour their own races? Even though in your own comment you've separated out "their own group" (whites) from "others" (non-whites).

I don't reject the findings, I just recognise that it isn't only one group engaging in such behaviour so it all equals out in the end.

&gt; The white majority were discriminating against the non white minority, that's why racial discrimination laws and political correctness were needed in the first place (and in a more recent example, until the police took steps to combat the institutionalised racism within the force). It's not a mistaken assumption, it's a correct observation.

And now the non-white minority are discriminating against the white majority. The pendulum has swung full circle, as it were. Also, is it discrimination by the police to stop and search more black youths if black youths are disproportionately committing the crimes police are stopping them for?

&gt; If you made it legal and socially acceptable to discriminate against people based on race, many people would then do so, either consciously or unconsciously.

And many more wouldn't. 

&gt; It would be a huge step backwards for minorities in this country, and for race relations.

Or it would finally be the day where people of all races were judged by the content of their character rather than the colour of their skin.

&gt; Minorities would suspect (correctly in most cases) that those advocating for a "right to discriminate" against non-whites were doing so because they wanted to discriminate against non-whites, not because they actually thought that it would counter-intuitively lead to less discrimination. 

And instead we have things the other way around where certain minorities are unfairly advantaged against others. People (correctly in most cases) believe that certain minorities didn't get to where they are on merit but because of the colour of their skin. And what does that do for race relations and tolerance?

&gt; Honestly I have a hard time believing that you even believe yourself that if we did away with political correctness we'd get people treat each other as people rather than members of a group identity, since you seem so keen to separate whites and non-whites into separate groups.

You've argued against me enough times to know better than that by now, Chris. You know I've a firm believer in the individual and not the group and have consistently said so.

&gt; I believe you are looking out for your own group, as you see it, white people. The claim that non-white people get preferential treatment is ridiculous, I've never felt discriminated against because I was white, that's just your victim complex talking.

Again, you [know better than to go down that path](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1043717/One-whites-claim-victims-racism.html). And there are enough examples of it from the BBC boardroom being "Hideously white" to Finnish nurses not being able to do the job. The irony is that you're right that context means that one is more likely to be seen as credible than the other but it isn't the one that is more credible than the other. I agree, but at the same time it's interesting that this is being researched and reported, what the author's own biases may have contributed to the debate, the reasons why each group feels that their moral righteousness is superior, etc. Because they are posting under an anonymous pseudonym, not on their public twitter account.That doesn't disprove my point at all. In fact, taking into account population demographics it would reinforce my point if it accounted for perpetrators but it doesn't (presumably for ideological reasons). And whilst historically racism had worse effects for non whites that hasn't been the case for decades. What a shockingly racist comment. Very bound in group identity rather than the individual actions of specific people. 

By all means remember injustice and ensure it is addressed and prevented in future but don't blame all members of a group, whether it be Muslims, whites, men or whatever for the actions of a few. It doesn't show that at all. It shows that white people are least likely to report racist attacks as racist or least likely to have racist attacks against them recorded as racist. Yes, [really](http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/may/29/positive-discrimination-civil-service-black-working-class). That's not to say that discrimination against non-white's doesn't happen though. But two wrongs don't make a right and positive discrimination is still just discrimination.

The Philips &amp; Lowery study you quote presuppose white privilege exists and assumes that hardships faced by whites are invalid. It's a non-falsifiable hypothesis."Typical white response"? "You like to deny it to maintain it"? Are you aware of your own racism?

I don't deny the CV name discrimination at all but that isn't just a racial thing and it is oversimplifying it to suggest otherwise. Perceived culture plays a far more important role than skin colour, as does perceived quality of university attended and so forth.

Also many places, although the public sector is notoriously bad for this, favour applications from so-called under represented groups - giving preference to non-white applicants even if white applicants are under-represented in the work force. 

Also, black boys are doing better than white working class boys at school and it's "fuck *them*" that people are saying.I know Liddle is morally correct, but the schadenfreude and sense of karmic justice are just too delicious to pass up.&gt; The right doesn't need to protest to get what it wants, every major state institution exists to give the right what it wants in the first place.

That's news to me! &gt; Some of these journalists, especially those from anti-Tory papers, tried to deflect the mob by declaring what they did for a living.

&gt; Think about that for a moment. Their implication, surely, is that if they really had been Conservatives, it would have been fine to spit at them.

This is shamefully telling. You underestimate the propensity for people to house share well into their 30s :-(I guess it is True what Haidt et al say about the left not understanding the right. You really don't have a clue.

The right want meritocracy, freedom, rule of law, democracy, etc. yes, but they also want a smaller state, lower taxes, reduced bureaucracy, an end to political correctness, etc. all things that every major state institution actively prevents happening!The Poll Tax really wasn't that different from Council Tax, it just had differing incentives and resulted in higher costs for those sacrificing by living in more crowded conditions in order to be more efficient with their money. Rents are already falling in some places, plateauing in others and rising less quickly than they otherwise would have in yet others. 

Fortunately we're indeed not likely to see riots over reducing tax credits because most of the recipients are in work and are therefore responsible people who want to keep their jobs. But living costs will adjust to revised income as the reduction of tax credits takes effect and we're already seeing this happen in terms of rent and should soon see it in other price elastic goods and services most likely to be affected.I think they're already there.The Poll Tax wasn't quite as bad as you are suggesting. It attempted to link resources used with contribution paid, which isn't a bad idea at all for improving efficiency in council service provision. It's certainly the greenest type of payment, for example. 

It also wasn't a "new" tax, in that it was a shifting from the onus on paying for council service provision through other taxes to direct payment, so outgoings weren't quite as significantly affected as you suggest either as personal tax allowances were increased and inflation increasingly better controlled. It didn't instantly make anyone homeless and landlords weren't liable for unpaid tenant's bills. 

Rents are already falling in places. Affordability is having affecting prices even though demand is often still significantly greater than supply. &gt; I'm not a lefty.

I hate to be the one to break it to you, Etchy, but you kind of are. 

&gt; The right do not want meritocracy, on the whole.

They do and always have. It is only through meritocracy that capitalism works and living standards increase. 

&gt; They don't want freedom either, they want complete social conformity

They do want freedom and they want social *cohesion*, conformity is merely one quite effective way of achieving it. 

&gt; they want you to technically have freedoms but then you not use them for fear of being rejected by polite society.

Again, this is about social cohesion, not totalitarian enforcement. Shared common values are an inherent good, so long as they are beneficial. Fairness, politeness, privacy, respect, etc. all fall into that category.Yes and no. It's more that seeing their own policies used against them may convince them that they were wrong in the first place, much as happened when the EU turned on Greece. Not a bad piece. The only bit I have issue with is:

&gt; Tax credits exist not because the Labour government was profligate, but because it recognised that topping up the incomes of the low-paid was a roughly least-bad solution to the problem of low demand for less skilled work.

...which ignores the effect of in work benefits on living costs and inflation. &gt; What other explanation is there?

That this was her attempt to mark her candidacy as a leadership candidate to replace David Cameron by appealing to those sufficiently disaffected from the Tory camp to be flirting with UKIP. Unfortunately it was rather poorly judged and I expect will exclude her from serious consideration.I got your point and you are correct in that the right broadly represents a hodge podge of views, but you are incorrect in that meritocracy, capitalism, freedom, etc. are not fundamental tenets of the right, not because the rank and file necessarily understand their importance but because of the results they deliver in terms of what the rank and file do understand.[Bully!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9HDRQAqV9E)&gt; You can't have it both ways mate. Either its a fundamental part of the philosophy or it isn't.

I'm not trying to have it both ways. They are a fundamental part of right wing politics.

&gt; The UK right existed before capitalism was invented. They've resisted every freedom at every turn.

Change is often resisted until and unless it can be shown to be good change. That is the conservative way.

&gt; Equal rights for gay people to get married the same way that heterosexuals has just been rejected by the tory party (though ti passed the house due to the lib dems).

Because it was (rightly) felt to be a religious issue, not a state matter. So long as gay people can have the same tax rights as straight people is as far as the state should get involved.

&gt; You're just *wrong*. 

You saying that doesn't make it so, Etchy. 

&gt; There is a strong subset of the tory party (particularly some Mp's) who have imbibed von mises, hayek etc but that stuffs brand new.

You are actually more optimistic than me if you think the subset is strong.

&gt; The right in the UK descends from highly authoritarian, militairistic, imperialist, royalists. If they had their way freedom would extend to letting you beg the local lord to not fuck your wife inbetween 12 hour shifts chained to a loom.

If you assume that they right are against change for the sake of being so, then you've not understood the right and further identified yourself as a leftie. All of the innovations that have made it possible for us not to *need* to work 12 hour shifts to earn enough to survive have come from the right e.g. private enterprise, technological innovation, labour efficiency, etc. That *is* a 100% increase.Proof that what are more frequent?&gt; would the right also turn the clock back? ... Yes. Yes they would.

Not even sure what you mean by this. If you mean would they prefer a more polite society, then obviously the answer is yes. If you mean would they prefer a return to feudalism as you implied earlier then obviously the answer is no.

&gt; Its *very* strong.

Sadly not strong enough for my liking.

&gt; The right want you to be subservient to a strong authority figyure for psychological reasons. They want gays removing from soceity, complete conformity (voluntarily chosen ofc) for the same reasons.

Dude, WTF? I mean, you don't seriously believe this, surely? 

&gt; Again, you are cofnusing free market capitalism with right wing politics. Don't do that, its silly.

It's not silly at all, it is necessary. 

&gt; The right want you to voluntarily give up your freedoms so you can prove you are worth being part of the collective. Individualism it ain't.

You are confusing authoritarianism with right wing politics. Right wing politics are about enabling individualism and lessening state involvement in peoples lives, things that are anathema to authoritarians. In total numbers? Or as percentages of the population?&gt; I think the average right wingers soul cries out for feudal obedience, for everything having a place and it staying in place. All the psych data suggests a combination of psychologically weak followers and sociopathic leaders making up your average right wing experience.

Man, I really don't know what to say to you. That's just sad. Like Scientology level sad. You're entitled to your opinion, but that is nutjob level conspiracy theorism. The average right winger is aspirational and believes in rewards going to the deserving rather than the needy i.e. that hard work should be rewarded. 

&gt; Its strong enough to destroy the protections you enjoy, but not strong enough to get you to a free market. The worst of both worlds. As a free marketeer myself, I dread what will happen because it rubbishes the idea of a free market in the popular mind.

I don't think the idea of a free market is rubbished in most peoples minds. 

&gt; When i say "I just like the facts" you should assume I mean it. All the data indicated that is the case.

No offence, Etchy, but your 'facts' aren't always facts and even when they are the conclusions you draw from them don't always seem to match them.

&gt; The only proper form of free market is georgist voluntaryism, the rest are inherently compromised.

You're an idealist? Explains a bit, I suppose. But pragmatism dictates that you can't always get what you want but if you try sometimes you just might find you get what you need. 

&gt; Right wing politics is all about and has always been about hierarcical authoritarian violence, the free market guys latched onto it for some reason (probably because like the bank robber said - "that's where the money is.")

Just because historically authoritarianism and right wing politics were positions held by political parties over the previous couple of centuries doesn't make the two the same thing. As you yourself have pointed out, libertarianism is right wing but inimical to authoritarianism. I don't think such data exists, but then I haven't said it does I've only pointed out the shortcomings of the data you've claimed said something it doesn't.&gt; Erm no, that's the data. http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/[1]
&gt; 
&gt; Theres shitloads of this stuff around, right wing politics has been studied closely for decades (because of the whole wanting to avoid genocide thing.)

Actually, it's because of the whole 'left wanting to prove they aren't stupid but the right are' thing. Personally I find the irony of the left adopting biological determinism only when it suits them sufficient to undermine the argument but even without that the article cites Haidt's research which further proves the opposite of what you are arguing.

&gt; Most people think free markets = crony crapitalism. They presume its bullshit used to steal from them.

I suspect that only a small segment of the left believe such errant nonsense. Most people are sufficiently intelligent to be able to draw the distinction as you don't need an above average IQ to do so.

&gt; When i say facts I mean facts. I look up the psych and social science research. See above.

But those *aren't* facts. They are opinions masquerading as facts. Dodgy conclusions drawn from dodgy data do not facts maketh.

&gt; Libertarianism is left wing. lol

Says the person quoting Rand in their preceding paragraph...I have been looking at the data for a very long time and it does not say that the right are more susceptible or supportive of authoritarianism. You don't need to know the history of China, Russia, Cambodia, Korea, etc. to know that. 

Furthermore there is nothing inherently lefty about holding the truth indivisible that all men are created equal. Rightism is the principle associated with supporting the rights of the individual at the expense of the group and leftism is associated with supporting the rights of the group at the expense of the individual.&gt; The study put in the same university and similar education levels.

I wasn't talking about the study you mentioned when referring to perceived cultural and prestige differences. 

&gt; You racist types always try and down play your racism and pretend it doesn't exist

So if I admit I'm racist I'm racist and if I don't admit I'm racist I'm racist?

&gt; because you benefit from it and therefore want to stay in the dominant position

There is no dominant position and any supposed benefits I reap for being perceived to belong to the majority are offset by politically correct backlash. 

&gt; We can spot your bullshit excuses and most of us don't accept them.

Why would you when you have a grievance that trumps reality?

&gt; My response to racism is to be even more racist back.

In that case it is most unfortunate for you that you see racism where there isn't any and as a result end up being racist yourself against those who are not.

&gt; fair is fair you did this to us and do it to us today

Do I? How well you must know me to be able to determine that.

&gt; Moving Chinese into lose, lose situations is what white people did to us. I do it back to you happily.

I've never moved Chinese people into any situation but you would happily put me in a lose/lose situation because of my skin colour? It's as if you think you have the moral high ground.

&gt; 0.7% of the population 3.4% of all violent crimes are suffered by us

Interesting that your stance implies that it is guilo inflicting these violent crimes against you without any data to support that...&gt; You've been reading too much niche libertarian stuff, imo.

Probably, but that doesn't mean I assume it is mainstream.

&gt; The left is founded on the idea that men have equal rights (they fuck up the implementation but their goal is equality) the right is founded on the idea that everyone must bow to authority.

Wrong. You've identified the right's *means* that everyone has equal rights and mistaken it for the motive. Like Haidt said, the left are all to often simply incapable of understanding the right whereas the right have no problem understanding the left. 

&gt; Nothing in historical right wing thought has anything to say about the rights of the individual.

You obviously aren't familiar with Magna Carta or English Common Law if you believe that.

&gt; The right wing descends from aristocracy and monarchy, it believes that you are either born to be used lke a farm animal or you are a farmer.

That's funny because it is what the *left* believes the right believes, not what the right actually believes. 

&gt; You are not so much wrong as focusing on to narrow a set of views. Which most right wingers (especially in the uk) don't hold and never have. (But some do and have I grant you.)

You're not so much right as failing to acknowledge that such views are valid whether they are the majority or not.I meant that the zealot who believes that oppression is real is more likely to take action against the oppressor class than someone who makes an insensitive joke is against the target of the joke. &gt; So when I get called names, get attacked it's all just a joke and some fun right and I'm overreacting?

No, but when you accuse someone who has said nothing racist and done nothing racist of being a racist, *then* you are overreacting.

&gt; I am happy to put you into lose lose situations because this is what you did to us collectively as a group.

It isn't what I did to you collectively as a group.

&gt; It matters not if you were personally involved or not. As collectively you stood by condoned and encouraged it. 

Nor did I stand by and/or encourage it any more than you stood by and encouraged it. 

&gt; There is only moralising and oh you shouldn't do that because of the shift in power east wards. Because all the bad things you're afraid of them happening to you.

I don't even know what you mean by that so I will just say this, collective punishment is wrong.Actually, cutting tax credits coupled with a minimum wage rise was an excellent way to go about that. The people opposed to it are just too blinkered to understand why it was such a brilliant move. You remove the upward pressure of in-work benefits on living costs whilst incentivising work and simultaneously using the NMW increase to offset the loss of tax credits. Sure, it's a blunt instrument but it is actually quite brilliant.The irony is that the Tories absolutely do understand Corbyn's position and draw attention to the faults with it and thinking the Tories have no interest in governing for the benefit of everyone shows no understanding of Tory policy!Ha! Funny! How do you think Kate Middleton will become Queen? 
Nevertheless it is an effective macro level solution for a macro level problem that over the medium to longer term will leave both the economy and the poor better off. It's just the short term where it may prove problematic which is why it was important to do it this early in an election cycle.[I didn't even click the thread to read or type comments!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe1a1wHxTyo)I made some of those comments and I stand by them. She gave consent to Ched at the same time that she was deemed capable of giving informed and meaningful consent to Clayton McDonald (incidentally who was acquitted of rape but who's life has also been destroyed). It will help significantly both at a macro level and at a micro level (as peoples behaviour will alter as a result of the changes).Your first paragraph compares things ceteris paribus but in the real world peoples behaviour will change as the removal on in work benefit takes effect. Undoubtedly there will be many people that are worse off in the short term as a result though. This is an inevitable consequence of a correction, but most will have the opportunity to mitigate this by taking differing actions to some degree or another.

Increased NMW will cost jobs, but again this is necessary to mitigate the impact of the issues you mentioned in your first paragraph and individuals will be responsible for doing this for themselves. You are wrong however that it will reduce incentives to work due to increased pay and increased personal allowance all whilst benefits are likely to be tightened further. 

As for the relative lack of overlap between tax credits receiving families and those with low incomes, from a macro perspective this doesn't matter. From a micro perspective individuals will again be responsible for mitigating their own circumstances. 

There is nothing inherently wrong with regressive changes, particularly when they are to correct a previous imbalance. In this case it makes work pay and the effects will drive down the cost of living over the medium term by reducing government funded demand. As a result, over the longer term the people that will be experiencing the pain in the shorter term will be better off if their circumstances remain consistent. I appreciate that this seems counter-intuitive to those on the left who have a different view on economics but to label someone who recognises this a fool whilst not recognising it yourself doesn't add weight to your argument and makes it look like you aren't capable of understanding why it was such a tactically clever move for the economy.They both had consensual sex with a willing partner who was utterly uncoerced and compos mentis at the time the consent was given. One of them got sent to prison and the other had his career as a professional footballer ruined. The only example it provides is that rape has become a politicised subject in the courts and that informed consent is no longer sufficient to determine whether a rape occurred or not. &gt; How can their behaviour change to offset the tax credit cuts?

How would your behaviour change if you suffered a comparable income drop? You'd reprioritise your budget, view overtime and other work opportunities differently, consider your partners work or lack thereof differently, etc. These things simply don't happen in a vacuum.

&gt; I don't see how people can be better off in the medium/long term.

Because the cost of living will fall without the artificial prop of in-work benefits to create upward pressure on it. 

&gt; Government subsidising something increases the incentives to do the thing, and taxing it reduces the incentive to do it. That is what I meant by "reducing the incentive to work".

Increasing the personal allowance whilst raising the NMW offsets the removal of subsidies to work.

&gt; Can you explain why the lack of overlap doesn't matter, macro wise? 

Because although individuals will react differently, overall the effect of the revised motivation and drive will average out.

&gt; What imbalance are you talking about?

That in-work benefits resulted in uneconomic work (due to the subsidy they provided). In other words, those at the lower end of the income spectrum were living beyond their means. This resulted in increased demand which in turn pushed up living costs, entirely mitigating the purported purpose of the in-work benefits in the first place. 

&gt; Tax credits already "make work pay", and are are a better system than a minimum wage that is 60% of the median wage

But they don't do so effectively. Furthermore, inflation will over time erode the effect of the NMW. I'd be very surprised if the Tories weren't planning on removing NMW post 2020 election. 

&gt; I don't see how it drives down the cost of living either - are you saying income that comes from the government, rather than from employers, increases demand so much that it causes inflation?

Yes. 

&gt; We do not have a positive output gap, or full employment, so how could demand pull inflation happen?

Because demand is concentrated. Those with low incomes who find their income increased by in-work benefits tend to spend the windfall on relatively similar goods/services which has a disproportionate effect on demand. 

&gt; Why does it matter where money comes from? I have never heard this argued anywhere else. 

That is the question. It matters because it doesn't come from improved productivity or efficiency in the workplace and is thus necessarily more inflationary than money that does. I haven't seen this argued elsewhere either but I doubt I'm the only one that has thought of it. And the 'deflation' (if you can call it that, 'price correction' would be more accurate), will only occur on those goods and services that the unearned windfall was spent on reducing the demand and thus over time leading to a more organic pricing as demand is no longer artificially inflated.

&gt; without taxes and benefits, the UK would have the second highest child poverty rate in the EU, at 40%. With taxes and benefits, this is reduced to 15% (not by, to), well below the EU average.

Again, people's behaviour would change as a result of the change in incentives. People who care about their kids would make differing life choices. What would eventually happen over time is there would be fewer children in poverty but those that are in poverty would be deeper in poverty if the government removes the current incentive to have children when you can't afford them. I would expect there to be a rethink on child benefit about a year or so before the next election.

&gt; Are you insinuating I'm "on the left?"

Yes, I was insinuating your stance on this issue to be on the left. Progressive doesn't automatically mean better, fairer or kinder and I didn't appreciate being called a fool just because you didn't get the point I was making, so I wanted to see where you pinned your colours to the mast.It's about making society economically productive so that living standards can be raised for all. The money needs to come from somewhere and the more of it there is the greater the share of the pie everyone has.&gt; The Judge and jury disagreed, that's why Evans got jailed.

No they didn't. The judge and the jury agreed that consent for Evans was given at the time that the so-called victim was engaging in consensual sex with McDonald. The judge misdirected the jury that she was able to give consent to both men at the same time but consent to one man was meaningful and informed and the other not because of her intent earlier on in the evening.

&gt; Evans got jailed because he could not, in the view of the court, have had a reasonable belief in consent.

Evans was jailed because the courts are being increasingly pressured to increase the rape conviction rate and this instance was deemed an opportunity to do so. Very much like the police, the courts are not interested in the truth or in justice, they are only interested in whether a conviction can be obtained or not.

&gt; "...CCTV footage shows, in my view, the extent of her intoxication when she stumbled into your friend. As the jury have found, she was in no condition to have sexual intercourse. When you arrived at the hotel, you must have realised that."

[There was no intoxication as the video footage demonstrates.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/news/video-1127850/Surveillance-drunken-girl-allegedly-raped-Ched-Evans.html) There used to be even clearer footage on the Ched Evans website that hid just her face but this has since been taken down although it even more clearly showed that she was not intoxicated.

&gt; Good, let their misery stand as a monument to their choices.

They chose to have sex with a woman who gave informed and meaningful consent. Unless you are a virgin you are as guilty as they are.

&gt; If they showed the least remorse, I'd be more inclined to sympathy, but as it is, I have none.

[So are you inclined to sympathy?](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2798830/i-m-ashamed-did-m-not-rapist-insists-footballer-ched-evans-legal-watchdog-fast-track-review-conviction.html) Personally I'm glad that his accusers life has been ruined and she's had to move home, although I do feel sorry for her family - it can't be nice to know your daughter is a lying slapper who has caused an innocent man to go to jail, ruined another innocent man's career and destroyed any chance of a normal home life for your family.

She had consented earlier to sex, with one of them.

Either she could consent to sex at the time she consented to sex or she could not. The Judge got it wrong and tried to say she could but also could not. It was misdirection, plain and simple. 

&gt; I would suggest that the multiple refusals to hear Evans appeals underlines that there is no point of contention legally.

Have you looked at the grounds for refusing appeal? Absolute bollocks from beginning to end. It is a travesty. 

&gt; From the facts as shown in the case, he is a rapist.

From the facts as shown in the case he didn't rape anyone. Being a convicted rapist doesn't mean that one is an actual rapist. 

&gt; I would suggest that the behaviour of both men is contemptible, it is not merely equivalent to normal sex with a partner you care for. 

You are entitled to your opinion, no matter how wrong it is. Adults are free to chose to engage in one night stands, multiple partners, partner swapping, etc. if they so wish. 

&gt; I would not have sex with a person whose judgement was impaired.

Nor would I but more importantly nor did Clayton McDonald or Ched Evans. 

&gt; Nor would I engage in treatment of a woman as a mere sexual plaything.

You must be a very disappointing sexual partner to the women in your life who have wanted this in that case. 

&gt; unless he admits his crime he shows no True remorse. 

Would you admit to something that you hadn't done just to be seen to be showing remorse?

&gt; I hope the woman is able to move on and rebuild her life. For Evans, I hope he becomes at least an example of what not to do. Maybe he'll redeem himself one day.

Hopefully his upcoming appeal will result in an acquittal. If it does I wonder what your stance would be then about what you've said thus far?Corbyn won't still be Labour leader in 2020.That says a lot about the quality of the arguments you are positing. Here you need to back up what you say and engage in a civil manner. There you just need to follow the circle jerk."Stark"? The Lannisters send their regards...But not irrelevant and the more of it the better.Girls who are "born ugly" can help it by using make up, hair, clothes, etc. to make the most of what they have. Even if they don't guys will still want to date them, they'll just be unattractive guys. That same simply isn't True the other way around. &gt; I would suggest it rather does. When an appeal judge and a panel of appeal judges refuse to allow your appeal, it's generally a sign you have in fact broken the law.

Of course it doesn't as various DNA results have consistently proven. Also, refusing to allow an appeal on a new point of law has nothing to do with whether the original conviction is safe or not. 

&gt; I did not suggest such behaviour should be illegal. Merely contemptible. And I stand by that. Good behaviour worth emulation is more than merely not breaking the law.

Should homosexual behaviour be contemptible? That makes as much sense as what you are arguing here. People have differing sexualities and if two consenting adults engage in behaviour that you don't enjoy there is nothing contemptible about that. 

&gt; So far every legal authority involved disagrees.

So far one trial judge who applied logical inconsistency and misdirected the jury agrees. 

&gt; That is firstly exceptionally rude, but also i would also note that one can love, respect and cherish a partner and also indulge such fantasies if you communcate well. 

You can also indulge in such fantasies with someone who is not a long-term partner if you both so wish. You don't need to be in a committed relationship to enjoy fantasies and suggesting that it is contemptible to so engage is far baser behaviour than so doing.



&gt; &gt; Would you admit to something that you hadn't done just to be seen to be showing remorse?

&gt; No.

Then why would you expect anyone else to?

&gt; I would still suggest his behaviour was contemptable, however, I wouldn't consider him a rapist.

Well that's a start. Kudos to you for that.

&gt; And I would at that point consider the victim to have perverted the course of justice.

I didn't think I'd end up defending the alleged victim in this discussion but how would you consider that she'd perverted the course of justice? If we assume that both parties are telling the truth, it seems clear that she cannot remember whether consent was given or not and as such this wasn't a malicious prosecution in the way that many others have been shown to be.

Not sure what you meant by your final quote, it appears to have been posted before you were finished typing.And people have asked why and you haven't yet replied an adequate response.Except it does draw attention to the double standard, gets some to question their shallowness, enable people to vent, etc.&gt; I agree that False accusations are a serious problem, however, there's no reason to believe that the False accusation level is 90+ percent. Just because an allegation doesn't make it to trial doesn't mean it is immediately False. 

You're right, of course, but let's not pretend that rape isn't an heavily politicised crime and that there is immense pressure from the feminist lobby to bring charges against accused men even if the evidence is virtually non-existent. It isn't at all unreasonable to assume that [the vast majority of accusations not taken forwards](www.avoiceformalestudents.com/avfms-mega-post-10-reasons-False-rape-accusations-are-common) by the courts are False.Some might, other's won't. More won't.Welcome to the real world where housing in high demand and low supply is expensive!But land is expensive, particularly land with planning permission and particularly land with planning permission where people most want to live.

What we need is higher quality housing stock (i.e. more expensive houses) and fewer people.&gt; It isn't the sex that bothers me, it's the attitude towards the woman.

You are aware that some women enjoy being treated as sex objects? That power-play is a thing? Sub and dom relationships, etc.? If the woman is willing, and the undisputed testimony in the Ched Evans case is that she was, then it doesn't matter if external parties find the engagement contemptible it only matters what those involved think.

&gt; I was brought up to be a good lad, as they say, and part of the traditional working class values ingrained was being taught to respect women.

I was brought up to be a good lad too, and part of the traditional middle class values ingrained was being taught to respect other people regardless of their sex.

&gt; It's not just women...

Glad to hear it.

&gt; ...everyone deserves basic courtesy, consideration of them as a person, not a mere tool for your use

Unless that is something they want, in which case it is perfectly acceptable.

&gt; the contemptible behaviour isn't about sex so much as respect, treating others well, not abusing them if you get opportunity

Again, unless that is what they want.

&gt; My point here however, was that you were needlessly rude, and that your insult didn't even hold water. 

I was personalising the example to make it more effective and for you to understand it more viscerally, but point taken - I retract that bit.

&gt; Because I believe him to be guilty.

You may well do, but he doesn't. And as you've already confirmed you wouldn't apologise for something you hadn't done.

&gt; From the evidence presented in court, he claims to have received consent, but contra to that is the evidence that the woman was incapable of informed consent.

There is no evidence the woman was incapable of informed consent. All accounts bar one agree that she was perfectly lucid and compos mentis with the only divergent view coming from the hotel supervisor Evans and McDonald were deliberately tricking to get both of them in the room.

&gt; If Evans is innocent, I would assume it to be because part of her account to be False, likely the loss of memory.

I don't believe she is lying in her testimony, I believe she is telling the truth. That she doesn't remember whether she was in a fit state to give informed consent or not. This alone should have been enough to create reasonable doubt. 

&gt; I figured that if she was drunk enough to black out a significant amount of memory, it's reasonable to conclude she was incapable of giving consent.

I know drinking well enough to know that I've made bad decisions when so drunk I can't remember what I did but when reminded of them the next day but unless I was paralytic I was responsible for my own decisions and if I consented in that state I consented. Same for this girl.

&gt; If it can be shown that she was capable during the period of memory loss I would agree

It was shown. All four witnesses plus the video footage confirm that she was sufficiently sober to walk easily in high heels across steps and uneven floors. She even remembered to go back and get her purse from the taxi. The only divergent view came from someone the players were in effect ripping off and refers to substantially earlier in the evening. But as stated, I believe she is telling the truth about her memory loss and the evidence suggests that there is more than reasonable doubt as to the conviction based on the testimony of the two players involved and the two who were watching through the window.They are like Bob Ewell spitting at Atticus Finch.It was not deemed hilarious. My respect for Prescott shot up when he retaliated and I thought it was outrageous that he was attacked by someone who simply disagreed with his policies. Fucking stand against him if you've got any balls. People who assault politicians of any stripe are scum.&gt; Undisputed because the woman cannot remember.

But it isn't he said she said. There were four witnesses there at the time who all independently corroborated what happened and she herself couldn't dispute it being the truth.

&gt; That does not indicate a state of mind to be willing, in my view. 

But she WAS willing because at the time she was engaged in consensual sex with McDonald.

&gt; It would also be undisputed if she had fallen unconscious. 

Unless there was a criminal conspiracy and all of the four witnesses were happy to lie about a rape, no, it wouldn't. 

&gt; The reports I've read indicates an attitude of assumption that Evans could join Mcdonald in having sex with the woman prior to her consent being sought, indeed it seems unlikely it was even considered that she might refuse.

No, that is not what happened. According to the evidence presented to the court [Evans asked the woman if she wanted him to join in, she replied that she did](https://www.crimeline.info/case/r-v-ched-evans-chedwyn-evans) and when he did she demonstrated [enthusiastic consent throughout the experience](http://chedevans.com/key-and-undisputed-facts.php). 

&gt; That isn't mutally sought after power-play, that is treating someone as an object with no regard.

That was an example of why your argument was incorrect, not something related to the particulars of the Evans case.

&gt; I think we are going to have to agree to disagree - I fundamentally disagree with you on the above.

I don't believe you or anyone else does disagree. If you consent to drive a car whilst drunk, it doesn't matter how drunk you were you still consented. Unless of course you were so drunk you couldn't even get to the car, but that is clearly not the case in the Evans example. Similarly, if you give consent then you give consent and neither drunkenness nor forgetfulness negates that, same as drunk driving.

&gt; I believe the law does also, it is not required that you be physically incapacitated to be incapable of meaningful consent.

Feminists did try to [get the law changed in 2003](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/consent/) but without success. 

&gt; I would note that many people remain capable of agreement with a question well beyond the point when they actually understand or consider what is being asked, and essentially the law requires a sexual partner to be capable of considering their assent.

In which case the consent would not be informed, but where reasonable doubt exists it should not be possible to render a guilty verdict as this requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that necessarily is not the case in R v Evans.Too bad he's not an expert on capitalism or economics, otherwise his arguments might have more merit.He's been trying to destroy it from within as his views on everything from Irish Republicanism to British Overseas Territories demonstrate. He's not a double agent, he's an out and out opponent of British interests and has never, until this year, pretended to be otherwise. 

&gt; Did reformers within the Soviet Union hate Russia?

They hated the USSR, yes. 

&gt; What you're actually arguing is that anyone who dislikes the status quo hates this country

It has nothing to do with the status quo and everything to do with what the nation stands for. Corbyn is anti-Britain, always has been and always will be. He's entitled to that opinion and has owned it for his entire career up until very recently. Pretending that he loves Britain when he has been working to undermine and dismantle it though is naive in the extreme. Wage subsidies lead to uncompetitive economies and rising living costs, particularly for basics. People don't like the truth but the truth is that tight as the benefits system is, it is still far, far too generous. If people were taxed less then it wouldn't be such a problem but our tax system is so carefully presented that few people realise how much they actually pay in terms of income tax, council tax, VAT, fuel duty, National Insurance, etc. If we take less then we can pay out less and everything becomes cheaper for everyone over time. Entrenched interests make it difficult, heart rending examples are used to counter sensible policy proposals, and benefits are so generous in relation to economically viable work that the poorest in work are often a lot worse off than those on benefits. I hope you shopped it to your local Job Centre?&gt; How is that consent for Evans?

Because either she was able to consent at the time or she wasn't. She can't have been able to consent to one at the time but not the other at the exact same time when she said  yes to both.

&gt; the crime in drunk driving stems from a situation in which you make a dangerous decision, but the limit for drink driving is so low that virtually any driver is going to be capable at the point they breach that limit.

The comparison is valid because there is no point at which the state of intoxication negates the consent in getting behind the wheel.

&gt; Regardless of your claimed disbelief, the law puts the burden of obtaining consent on the accused.

Evans did obtain consent. All the witnesses at the time confirmed it.

&gt; Clearly the testimony given by the pair and their friends did not convince the jury, nor the judge.

It should still have been enough to provide reasonable doubt unless there was sufficient evidence to prosecute for attempting to pervert the course of justice.

&gt; Evans has been tried, fairly, in the opinion of an appeal judge and a panel of appeal judges.

This is False. The judge on the initial case refused leave to appeal but Evans' lawyers have had new evidence come to light and the appeal will now be heard.

&gt; He is trying to introduce new evidence because there was no substantiated grounds to appeal his conviction.

There were significant grounds but they were rejected. The rejection of the appeal is an [absolute joke](https://www.crimeline.info/case/r-v-ched-evans-chedwyn-evans) [begins about halfway down the page]. There is no justice there.

&gt; He may well go to his grave flapping his gums that he's no rapist, but the law has judged him and found him to be so.

It's not as if anyone convicted has [never been later exonerated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice). 

&gt; If he cannot obey the law, let him serve by the ruin of his career standing as an example to others as to the consequences of their actions 

But he *did* obey the law. He asked for and got consent at the time when she was necessarily proven to have been capable of giving consent (as she was engaged in sex with McDonald who was found not guilty). You don't have to like the fact that he had a one night stand but he certainly didn't rape anyone unless asking for and obtaining consent along with enthusiastic consent throughout the act is rape.I'm not a sufficient expert on robots to posit a sufficiently informed opinion.There are still finite resources, finite time and finite enthusiasm for risk in a world where labour is infinite and free. Having a perfectly automated world doesn't change that.Nope. It doesn't for other non-EU but EEA states.We will certainly be trading with Europe on MORE favourable terms than now as our veto will actually have teeth instead of being able to be overruled. And we will attract the immigration we want whilst being able to refuse that which we don't want. Your points are so far from self-evident it is shocking that people still believe them when they are so patently unTrue.&gt; I've never seen anyone suggest we can't.

Funny, you don't *seem* new around here...&gt; Scientists are experts on ~~the economic consequences of~~ *obtaining funding for* scientific research and development.

FTFY.We wouldn't enter EFTA, we would simply remain members and yes there are still fees to be a member but nothing like the disproportionate amount the UK pays to the EU.&gt; They do but we need to trade with them more than they need to trade with us.

Only so long as we are in the EU. Once we're out we're free to trade with whoever we want and then they need us far more than we need themNo, I get it, but you clearly don't.

Corbyn *does* believe his ideas will damage Britain and *that is his intent*. He doesn't want the entity of Britain to exist. He wants a unified Ireland, an independent Scotland and for all I know a Democratic People's Republic of Wales.

&gt; To be honest, until you prove his motive is to harm this country nobody has any reason whatsoever.

He has been honest about his intent for decades. This isn't new information. Okay, there is a bit of deception around the extent of his hatred for the UK now that he is opposition leader but it is still on display for all to see. You can argue that he loves his country all you want but he's always put her down and if it were a domestic relationship he'd be guilty of spousal abuse. 

Nice attempted revisionism of the USSR too. There were only two sorts of people in the USSR, those who saw what it was and wanted to take advantage of it and those who saw what it was and wanted to destroy it. No one wanted to make it better and your deluded if you think anyone did. 

&gt; I'm sorry but you're just being a complete twat here. I see no reason whatsoever to take you seriously.

No offence but if you think I'm being a twat by pointing out the objective reality that Corbyn has been working against the interests of the UK and for the interests of our enemies for several decades then you simply don't understand politics. Pretending that Corbyn was trying to make the UK better by undermining it, destroying it's influence, weakening it's economy, etc. is wilfully ignoring reality. He wanted to destroy the UK as it was, not make it better. He didn't want prosperity, he wanted everyone to be equally poor. He didn't want a high standard of living, he wanted full employment. And he didn't want the UK to be able to exercise influence, he wanted socialist and communist states where people were literally dying to flee to have the same level of influence as the state that ended slavery and fought off Nazism and Communism. You must be a scientist because you have no understanding of economics. Innovation, technological advancement, voluntary cooperation, return on investment, opportunity cost, etc. these things don't go away simply because you have robots performing the labour. Star Trek TNG this ain't.I've had dozens of arguments about this point over the last couple of years and it is really only since the UKIP win in the European election that the side arguing that we won't be able to trade has finally gone quiet. 

I'm not going to rebut your main point because it is pretty sound, the only thing you ignore is the potential offered to the professional service sector by unfettered free trade with the Commonwealth and other free trade desiring nations making up the slack from any EU loss. &gt; While we are in the EU we are very useful to them once we leave we are just another competing nation.

Our trading partner status doesn't change simply because we cease political union. Upon leaving we would be the EU's single largest external market, giving us more sway in trading terms than China, the USA or anyone else. 

&gt; I dont know if you have had much negotiation experience but you do not want to be negotiating from a position of weakness and since the vast majority of our exports are to the EU, and the majority of their exports are not to Britain we would have the weaker position.

As already stated, we would be their largest external market but they would not be ours if we were free to trade as we wish. We would be the ones negotiating from a position of strength, not the EU (where at the moment our voice is ignored).

&gt; We cant just swap all the trade we have with the EU to another country it doesn't work like that.

We wouldn't swap it at all. We would continue it AND be free to trade elsewhere, with NAFTA, the Commonwealth and other free trade minded states across the globe. We would literally get the best of both worlds. &gt; Any evidence for this, whatsoever? 

Yes. It's called "inflation".

&gt; I agree, but that doesn't negate the need for some kind of welfare.

And some kind of national and domestic security too. But we used to rule almost half the world with half the people we now have employed as civil servants. We aren't operating anywhere near optimal efficiency in the public sector and carry an awful lot of unproductive and even counter-productive employees. Government spending as massively higher than it needs to be and looking at how high our taxes are we could be a lot further to the left of the Laffer Curve and generating far greater growth and producing far higher living standards if we cut out all the things we don't need. Seems like a good, solid contributor - thanks for supporting him!You assume the EU is a homogeneous body with a single interest. It is not. It would have disproportionate harm on individual member states to cease trading with us, far more than it would for us to cease trading with them. You see how our positions would be different. 

A financial transaction tax would be interpreted (rightly) by the world as a punitive action and cost the EU significantly in terms of international good will, trust and belief in free trade. It would demonstrate that the EU is a protectionist entity, not a bastion of free trade and counter to the purported reasons for its very existence. I wouldn't put it past the EU to cut of it's nose to spite it's face in this way but that's all the more reason we're better off as far away from ever closer political union as possible.It is necessarily a tautology. Similarly so with NMW, whilst they don't have a massive effect on overall inflation they do have a significant effect on the price of goods that those on NMW now have increased demand for, leading to disproportionately higher living costs for the worst off as well as higher living costs overall. In theory, sure, it's Star Trek. In practice though, competition would still exist, risk would still exist, money would still exist, none of the things that make an economy an economy would go away. The City is a pretty insular community and there is very little exposure to alternative narratives because deviating from the dominant narrative is so severely punished. The EU's customs union [does interfere](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/commonwealth/com05.htm) significantly with our ability to trade with the Commonwealth let alone other Free Trade minded states and blocs. Furthermore, there won't be a loss of access to Europe. Also, your attempted appeal to authority is a fallacy.

&gt; Given that there is no evidence there would be any gain to be had from the Commonwealth, and the fact that they already have their own perfectly good professional services, and that most of our major firms already do a lot of business with them, I'm struggling to see how there could be any gain on that front.

Given that you'd made up your mind on your position without having [informed yourself fully](http://www.iea.org.uk/blog/why-the-uk%E2%80%99s-first-port-of-call-should-be-the-commonwealth-if-it-leaves-the-eu) of the situation that is hardly surprising. 

&gt; A recent study suggested that lawyers would be particularly hard hit, and I think that is right - currently we get a finger in almost everything large in Europe, and that would end as finance would pass through Germany instead, so a lot of the transactional work would dry up.

Some indeed might and it will be up to British firms to compete, just as it will be up to the British financial sector to compete. But being that London is the global capital city and only Wall Street surpasses it's pull in financial market terms I have a little more faith than you do in the UK's ability to remain the dominant force in finance on this side of the Atlantic.

&gt; Without a unified market with the Commonwealth, the idea of which is laughable, there would be nothing to replace it.

You are aware the Commonwealth isn't the only potential trading partner outside the EU, right? The Anglosphere alone can easily compete with the EU and we already have a closer small "P" political union with them than we do with Spain or Sweden.&gt; Wage subsidies lead to uncompetitive economies and rising living costs

As an ostensible right winger I would expect you to get this without me needing to explain but here we go. A wage subsidy gives money to those at the lower end of the income spectrum. Those at the lower end of the income spectrum aren't in a position to save and so spend that extra money. The extra demand generated by this extra money tends to be concentrated on relatively few goods and services that are most pressing for those at the lower end of the income spectrum. This increased demand causes prices to rise. Even if all the goods and services were relatively price elastic (which they are not) there would still be an increase as this elasticity took effect. 

At the same time, this extra money comes from increased taxation, not improvements in efficiency. Higher taxes reduce overall disposable income for the middle classes pushing them closer to the working classes in terms of spending power. This generates even further concentration of demand (although due to lifestyle choices this isn't quite so pronounced beyond basics). 

So the result of wage subsidies is inflation/rising living costs. It is a tautology. &gt; Greece? The EU is perfectly capable of cutting off its nose to spite its face and acting out of spite.

And look at how the left now view the EU, having previously seen it as a force for good.

&gt; If I were negotiating for the EU I would spank the UK so hard no one else would consider doing it.

No doubt this is what Baroso and his pals are planning but the more unfair whatever punitive action the EU takes against the UK upon exit is, the less credibility it will have, the less willing members will be to support it and the more likely others are to see its True colours. 

&gt; For me there are arguments to leaving the EU but it really irritates me when the leave camp acts as if there would not be an enormous cost.

There would be cost, but this would be more than matched by alternative opportunities. It isn't as if we'd simply stop trading with the EU after all.&gt; Now you're just talking shit. Explain to me how Corbyn has displayed his intent to damage Britain for all to see.

I just did in my preceding post! Weren't you reading it? A unified Ireland, an independent Scotland, the Falklands given to Argentina, the UK leaving NATO and having it's military weakened, etc.

&gt; The USSR very nearly did stay united in 1991 and simply reform itself so you're talking shit their. The referendum they held on the matter is overwhelming.

Are you unfamiliar with how the [voting system](http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12641.html) worked in the USSR? In a nutshell, you didn't get to pick who you voted for, the people at the polling station chose for you.

&gt; You are now arguing that because you believe his policies are bad that so must he.

It has nothing to do with his policies and everything to do with his intent. It is perfectly possible to support a unified Ireland without hating the UK but Corbyn does hate the UK. The policies aren't the reason he does they are just the result of him doing so. 

&gt; Please for the love of god say something that isn't worthless.

If you don't think Corbyn hates the UK, that's your right. But he does and he his actions over the past three decades have consistently reinforced that and only that view. He is a fifth columnist, an Oswald Mosley. You can make the argument that he only wants to change the UK because he loves it but it is obviously unTrue.I'd buy one and so would my wife![We couldn't afford a tent in the living room.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe1a1wHxTyo)For someone so ready to refer to The City as an authority you don't seem to understand it very well. Confidence is key and undermining confidence can be and is career threatening. Politics, both big P and small p matters there just as much as it does anywhere else. The reason the banks aren't pushing it is because there won't be more money for them and they'll have to work harder and expose themselves to greater risk to maintain what they have if they can even do that. But The City makes up only about 11%-12% of the total UK economy and gains can and will be made elsewhere. 

&gt; I have already explained to you in detail why this is wrong. I wont insult your intelligence by suggesting you didn't understand it rather than refused to address it.

And I won't insult yours by pointing out that I have not disagreed that leaving the EU would come at a cost already. 

&gt; I've explained why people in the City are a better source than you.

Interesting that you assume I'm not in The City. As it stands I'm not any longer but maintain a network there and have seen first hand the effect of the narrative I discussed previously in action. 'Blinkered' is the most accurate assessment of The City's attitude towards the EU. 

&gt; Well you could say that for anything. "Let's tank the economy, it will be up to British firms to compete".

Except we're not saying that at all. We're saying "Let's continue to trade with the EU but get out of this ever-closer-political-union bit and trade more extensively elsewhere once we're free of the customs union".

&gt; It is stupid to take away one of the contributing factors of our success and then say 'they will have to compete'. How about we support them in keeping up the good work?

We are supporting them, just not at a disproportionate cost to other sectors. 

&gt; I don't care how much faith you have! I've explained why we could not possibly retain the majority of European capital market trade.

You've made an argument but not a very compelling one. It's not inconceivable that London's share of capital market trade might be reduced but it is to suggest that it would not remain the European city of finance. 

&gt; It would be nice to work out a way to improve trade relations with other countries, but there is nothing inherently better about trading with Canada over Germany - their money is still worth the same.

Without meaning to insult your intelligence, why not both? We simply do not require or desire political union to trade with the EU and being a member is a net drain on UK PLC. &gt; The problem is they agree with us now but once we leave they will benefit from punitive measures against the UK.

It's not as much a problem as you think because individual states with the EU will suffer more than the UK and will object to overly punitive measures that will impact their trade with us. Eventually the whole corrupt edifice will come tumbling down but in the interim individual states increasing their dissatisfaction, willingness to cooperate and sacrifice their own interests to support this utopian fantasy will keep chipping away at the foundations. 

&gt; We wouldn't stop trading with the EU we would still have a trade agreement but it would unquestionably be worse than our current agreement.

It's possible it could be worse but equally possible it could be better. Don't forget, now our voice is ignored if it isn't a majority but once we're outside our voice cannot be ignored and we have alternative options if the EU plays silly buggers too often.

&gt; If we are going to trade outside the EU then we need to gear up for it and have a proper plan in place before we can even consider the benefits.

This is already in hand but frankly a lot of it won't be state led but industry led. What if you own your own home and marry someone that also owns their own home and want to move in together but neither one wants to give up their previous home?Good, good, let the revitalisation flow through you...I don't think either of us grants either of those positions any merit. If we leave there will be a price to be paid and there will be risk involved in making up that potential loss. If we stay then we remain a small and ineffectual voice in Europe where we will continue to be outvoted on issues affecting our interests and with no right of veto, but we avoid the risks associated with leaving.There would be real risks to business as confidence changes and potential punitive measures may be introduced by the EU in retaliation for BrExit, but free movement of people won't be a significant issue as the UK will be able to operate essentially the same as it does now except being able to say no to undesirable migrants. &gt; Those aren't innately anti-British policies, they're just something you believe would be bad.

I don't think an independent Scotland would be bad but it would be decidedly anti-British. 

&gt; I could argue David Cameron hates Britain as he seems to want to use our most unfortunate citizens as wage slaves, give our money away to dictatorships, lie to us constantly, stir up anger and risk breaking up the union he claims to desperately want to keep together because of his short sighted desperation for a majoirty, his attack on our disabled citizens and I could go on.

Now *those* are policies you don't like but they aren't anti-British in the way that Irish reunification or giving up the Falklands is. 

&gt; I don't believe he hates Britain, I have the fucking sense to realise he just has what is to me a fucked up view of what he believes Britain should be.

There is nothing wrong with what he believes Britain should be, it's a view shared by many on the left. Fortunately not all of them are prepared to go against the democratic mandate of the people to achieve it though unlike Corbyn prior to his election to leadership of the opposition. 

&gt; What you're doing is falling at the first hurdle and going "I DON'T LIKE THOSE POLICIES!! HE MUST HATE BRITAIN!!!" and it's nothing short of miserable hysterics at best and dangerous lies at worst.

No offence, but that's nonsense. An attempt to dismiss rational and considered argument because Corbyn's policies are as bad as his beliefs. 

&gt; He also has a different view of what makes a nation good than you. You seem to view it as a matter of prestige and influence while he views it more as the happyness of it's citizens and it's moral standing.

And he's entitled to that different view even if it is ignorant of what my view actually is. 

&gt; Just, take a step back and realise that different people have different opinions to you and that doesn't make them evil. Seriously guy, this is something you're meant to do when you're like, 11 years old.

This would be funny if you didn't mean it so sincerely. Rest assured, I don't think Jeremy Corbyn is evil and I don't think he hates Britian because of the policies he has chosen to adopt. I think Corbyn is a naive idealist who hates what he sees as an imperialist Britain that deserves to be penalised and offer restitution to the rest of the world for the evil done in it's name over previous centuries. But *that* is the sort of thing you're meant to grow out of when you're 11 years old. 

&gt; Usually yes but for that to be the case during their referendum it would mean they rigged the results so that nearly 80% voted to keep the country together so they could do the oppsite and break it apart anyway. **That wouldn't make any sense at all.**

Congratulations, you now understand why it didn't work.

&gt; You've yet to provide any evidence whatsoever that he hates us than the fact he disagrees with you.

[Come on!](http://www.capx.co/the-inconvenient-truth-about-corbyn-and-the-ira/) and that's without mentioning him [honouring terrorists](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11879164/We-victims-of-the-IRA-are-furious-about-Jeremy-Corbyn.html) with a minutes silence as a show of respect or [refusing to condemn their terrorism](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3187245/Jeremy-Corbyn-blasted-refusing-condemn-IRA-terror-attacks-FIVE-TIMES-asked-repeatedly-live-radio-Northern-Ireland.html). 

&gt; Jesus Christ, repeating a belief over and over again is not evidence for it and it's really annoying.

I can't believe that you'd even enter into this debate without having seen first hand the evidence for yourself that shows what I've said. I've included a few examples for you in the preceding paragraph but he has form going back 30 years. It isn't me repeating that makes it True it's that all the evidence shows it to be True.You sly dog, trying to win with patronisation ;-)

Trade will obviously continue with the EU but the UK won't be constrained the the customs union upon BrExit, leaving us free to trade with other so minded states. I would expect there to be an initial short-term blip as market confidence is lost but then growth increasing above Eurozone rates as the UK takes advantage of it's greater freedom to trade more liberally with the rest of the world. 

As for the EEA including provisions for free movement, yes it does but things are [never that simple in practice](https://www.freemovement.org.uk/uk-blatantly-obstructing-eu-free-movement-rights-with-red-tape/) and whilst the EEA does include a free movement clause it is significantly less binding than that under Article 45. If you're interested, Lichtenstein provides perhaps a better example than the Norway option of how the UK would deal with this in practice following BrExit. &gt; we cannot allow them to march us blind into political union.

You have more faith in David Cameron than I do if you think this won't happen. 

&gt; The problem is that immigration is the other weapon the leave campaign is fighting on and that is at best disingenuous and at worst harmful to the national interest.

Not really. Outside of the EU we get to keep all the good bits of immigration whilst rejecting all of the bad bits. The best of both worlds. Initially this will inevitably tightened up due to overloaded infrastructure and housing costs, but over time immigration will find it's way to optimal levels for growth balanced against societal cohesion. 

&gt; I don't know the answer but I just think everyone has 1 vote so everyone has the right to all the facts of the debate. By the sound of it we could have a good and fair debate about the EU which is what it should be. I just worry we are going to make the public make the decision about fear, fear of losing jobs or fear of immigration.

People don't like change and the sheer levels of immigration have meant that Britain has changed at a far greater pace than many people are happy with. This makes the fear argument a valid one and doubtless the "Leave" camp will make use of it. 

&gt; In that scenario the people with the best PR firm win, we need our country to win. (I cant think of a better way to phrase that without sounding like one of those terrible speeches)

I actually thought that was q good way of putting it. And of course, you're right. The whole reason for having the referendum is to determine what is best for Britain. It's unfortunate that spin will play such a significant role in the outcome, but inevitable that both sides will use everything in their arsenal to win on such an important issue. 

Personally I think we have to leave as the EU simply will not allow what the UK requires, a free trading bloc with entirely voluntary opt-in political union for those who desire it. The elites are too wedded to their utopian ideals to entertain giving the people what they want. &gt; pensioners... didn't pay enough in to the welfare state they're cashing out of.

That's not True. They did pay in enough. Consecutive governments overspent. Put the blame where it belongs.&gt; If we're all in it together, why aren't they?

Because they vote. He also observed a minutes silence for IRA terrorists and refused to unequivocally condemn their bombings without drawing parallels with what British soldiers did despite the question being asked five times and specifically about bombings. &gt; The consent for Mcdonald was only considered valid because of her earlier consent, at the time they were having sex, her abilty to give consent was considered not to be present.

That would mean she wasn't able to consent at the time McDonald had sex with her.

&gt; No, he didn't, a jury of his peers convicted him.

Miscarriages happen. That aside, he saw that she was in a fit state to consent (by consenting with McDonald and by all accounts being entirely fit to do so), specifically asked for and obtained her consent, and maintained enthusiastic consent from her throughout the experience. Whichever way you look at it he did everything right and should never have been convicted.&gt; you denigrate and celebrate the misery of the woman in this case, calling her a slapper, and yet you demand that my relatively moderate judgement of Evans and Mcdonald's behaviour as morally deficient be withdrawn because we should live in a time where no judgement is made of another's sexual practice.

I'm not sure that accurately reflects my position. I don't celebrate the misery of this woman for being a slapper, she is entitled to be and I fully support her choice to decide what she does with her own body. Where I celebrate her misery comes from her having made bad decisions whilst drunk and pinning extremely serious consequences on innocent people in order to avoid her own culpability for those decisions. Returning to the driving whilst drunk analogy, she's attempting to blame the passengers she offered to drive rather than herself for driving drunk.

&gt; I do not see how your approach is logically or morally consistent.

Because the convicted party ascertained she was compos mentis, asked for and obtained consent and maintained ongoing enthusiastic consent. There was no mens rea. There was no rape. 

&gt; I consider that on my side of the argument I am demanding that the law and CPS guidelines be followed consistently for all parties.

But it isn't applied consistently. It is literally undisputed by the alleged victim herself that she gave consent. The only question is whether she was in a fit state to do so. The acquittal of McDonald indicates that legally she must have been in a fit state to do so (by all accounts she did not drink after she initially agreed to return to the hotel with McDonald).

Now personally, I wouldn't want sloppy seconds if a friend of mine was sleeping with someone else, but if that is what both parties wanted (and it isn't in dispute that they did) then they are free to do so. To then call it rape because you cannot remember what you agreed to is disgraceful and someone so doing deserves everything that happens to her as a result. &gt; HarryBlessKnapp Right-Wing Liberal 1 point 5 hours ago* 

Christ man, don't you ever fucking sleep!?!?


&gt; If we can keep a completely free trade agreement with the EEA so as to affect British businesses positively going forward, I can't see any good reason to stay in the EU. I just really can't see this happening

The EFTA compromises that other states have show that such an arrangement has precedent. And whilst I agree with you that the EU will want to exact their pound of flesh for the UK pointing out what a sham the set up is it remains in both parties interests to reach as equitable as possible a resolution.

&gt; I've not really heard any convincing arguments about the details of exactly how we will retain all of the specific benefits of the EEA to particular businesses, and at the same time open ourselves up to free trade agreements outside of this, whilst freeing us from all the restrictions of the EU that we don't like

We won't be able to free ourselves from all the restrictions we don't like but instead of being overruled when we point out that X or Y will be harmful to British industry, industry itself will have the choice of whether to meet the EU standards with all of the additional costs associated or to market elsewhere without the additional costs. Plus, the UK being able to say "No" will influence our strength in negotiations far more than when we were in the EU and our "No" could simply be ignored.

&gt; The EEA route sounds like the best option, but will that provide exactly the same, and I mean exactly the same, legislative framework that provides British businesses with a competitive edge right now.

Well, yes. Unless specific legislation we have signed up to is repealed or it isn't similarly in our interests to sign up to newly proposed legislation then things will remain the same.

&gt; With all the risk involved behind this, it just makes me nervous, given that the financial benefits of a brexit are fairly hypothetical.

The financial benefits are NOT hypothetical, but they do require effort to be realised and there is risk involved. 

&gt; I also can't see any way in which free movement of labour isn't intrinsically linked to free trade.

I've touched on this with the links in my earlier post. Leaving the EU would have the effect of the UK being able to pick and choose which migrants to accept in practice. It would be us having our cake and eating it.

&gt; But being a part of the eea sounds like the perfect compromise in theory. Providing we get to keep the same exact free trade in place that we have now.

It might not be the exact same, but it should be as close to what we have now as possible as makes no difference so that EU states can trade freely with us and we can trade freely with them (which is what most people wanted in the first place and how the whole shebang was sold to the British people back in 72).What a sweetie he must be! Creating a whole new account just to highlight your contributions to this sub! They voted them out as well. And as has been shown, it didn't make any difference which party was in power, they both overspent.The EU will stagnate in terms of growth because there are too many competing interests acting against one another. China and India are far more homogeneous. Also, the UK will be able to negotiate better deals for the UK as the UK than it will as part of the EU where our interests are so often ignored. 

&gt; There will always be an EU if we are in it then it works better for us as a country as long as we retain our sovereignty.

If the EU reverts to a free trade bloc then it will survive. If it attempts to continue as the EUSSR then it will fail. It really is that simple. 

PS I'm sorry to see that you are being downvoted for disagreement when you are clearly contributing. I've upvoted all of your posts in this thread as meagre compensation.&gt; If this guy had to spend \u00a3220 000 to clear his name, the woman must have had a strong case.

Considering legal fees and the costs of obtaining sufficient evidence to clear ones name I would say this sum suggests that she had a very *weak* case, not a strong one at all, otherwise the figure could have run significantly higher. 

&gt; Wouldn't be surprised if it was rape but again it's impossible to tell.

It is possible to tell that it wasn't rape. You [don't get to prosecute someone for a False rape accusation unless you have absolute and overwhelming proof](http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/dec/01/109-women-prosecuted-False-rape-allegations) that the person making the False accusation knew that they were making a False accusation.

&gt; The article writer is saying it definitely wasn't rape, so both sides are wrong.

Even if the aforementioned wasn't proof enough (which it is) we still have innocent until proven guilty in the UK so the author is correct and the other side is wrong.It's UK politics. It's interesting. Why are people continually being dicks about whatever JK posts?That's *my* line!No it isn't coercive to see if someone has changed their mind and reluctant consent is still consent. Polygraphs don't tell whether a person is lying or not. The threat of the polygraph makes the person supposed to take it more likely to admit things.&gt; Because she cannot remember events, was evidenced as very, very drunk (leaving her purse in the kebab shop etc), and the key witness unconnected to the accused testifies as to her lack of capacity.

[That is not an accurate depiction of events.](http://chedevans.com/key-and-undisputed-facts.php)

&gt; She was incapable, in my view. And the view of the court.

You are entitled to your opinion, but there is reasonable doubt as to the veracity of it when the full facts are taken into consideration.

&gt; We fundamentally disagree unfortunately. She was incapable of consent. It was rape.

And yet she was able to consent to someone else at the same time she was not able to consent to Evans. All the witnesses at the time of the alleged offence confirmed that she was in a fit state to consent, did consent and maintained enthusiastic consent throughout. 

&gt; McDonald's defense was a reasonable belief in consent, and he had reason to have such prior to arrival. Evans did not.

This begs the question why that would make any difference? She did not continue drinking and so should have been sobering up having not had alcohol for the duration of their interaction.There is no maximum number of times that someone can ask if another person has changed their mind. And saying "Yes" is giving consent, even if it is reluctant.Somehow I suspect that most of them agree with Galloway that it's all Israeli False flag operations that area killing and maiming Israelis just so that Israel has an excuse to steal more Palestinian land.That was incredibly satisfying to watch. You should post the video clip linked to /r/JusticePorn He chose to ignore it. Because I believe in justice and enjoy seeing it served? I'd argue that someone who doesn't value justice is more in need of help than I am.It's the way of the Left ;-)You're right, people should be allow to throw rocks with impunity! Whatever was I thinking that it is a good thing that someone throwing lethal projectiles get taken down? It's not an invalid question but it is beyond ridiculous to believe that Israel is deliberately setting itself up for pariah status in the world by faking outrages, murder and violence against it's own citizens. The costs outweigh the benefits for Israel by such a magnitude that it simply isn't possible. It would be like cutting off your leg to lose weight. Sure, it might work but no one would ever do that. 

Besides, everyone now knows about Pallywood so even if Israel wanted for some crazed reason to destroy itself on the global stage it wouldn't need to because it has Palestinians doing it already. Firstly it isn't illegally occupied, secondly even if it was the guys were throwing rocks. Anyone that throws a rock against someone else is fair game in my book.Watch it again. There was no incitement by anyone that pulled out a gun, nor did any of the gun holders throw rocks. They were merely in the crowd.Ruizscar may have some wacky beliefs but he's not an anti-Semite, just a conspiracy theorist. We've discussed things before and although we disagree he's a lot more reasonable than his beliefs might at first suggest. And as he rightly pointed out, the question itself isn't invalid. False flag operations do happen. Even the US has used them, so democracies do. But that was during the Cold War in Latin America and the notion that a state like Israel would do so against it's own citizens when it already is faced by hostility on all sides simply doesn't add up and I think Ruizscar will not only understand that but possibly even agree that it would be "superfluous" for Israel to False flag.Ditto.&gt; So let me understand what you're trying to say here. 

Somehow I think based on your contributions so far you're going to struggle with this, but go ahead...

&gt; You're saying that if this is indeed an illegal military occupation, then people should not be allowed to throw rocks at soldiers. Is that right?

So far so good! Well done! I have to admit that I thought that observing the rules of war might be too much for you but credit where credit is due, you got this right. Not wearing military uniforms and engaging in guerilla warfare using human shields is something they should not be allowed to do. Correct!

&gt; What would you prefer they do? Shoot guns? Maybe fire some rockets? 

Well, first they need a formal declaration of war. Then they need to abide by the rules of war. Then they need to enjoy their stay in Hell where they will be for the rest of eternity.

&gt; Or do you not believe Palestinians should defend themselves and their country under any circumstances whatsoever? 

If they have an issue they can take it to the courts. Unlike the rest of the region, the courts in Israel treat everyone equally regardless of their race or religion. They could easily get guys to commit if they lost the weight. But "I'm too lazy to get guys to commit to me" doesn't inspire much sympathy.Make up, a decent haircut, getting fit, dressing effectively make all the difference in a world to even the ugliest girl. They don't mean diddly squat to a short guy though.Listen, kid. You're young and you think this matters right now but it doesn't. It's a temporary blip. You can address it now by working on your expression. Get a haircut that doesn't make you look twelve and wear adult clothes. Those coupled with a broody pout and no one will think you're anything younger than 25. It's cute that you want *so much* to be right but you're not :-(

That last one is Channel 4, famed for their pro-Palestinian bias :-)

What is even cuter is you not understanding the reason there is a problem with Israel using human shields is because the various Palestinian terror groups don't care. They think it's great for their propaganda value if an innocent child gets shot or blown up which is why they have often tried to get [youngsters to wear bomb vests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_suicide_bombers_in_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict).

&gt; Israel is one of the only countries in the world where minority groups are specifically not given equal status under the law. 

Hahaha *this* is so clueless. You really think that you would be treated more equally under the law in any of the countries bordering Israel compared to Israel? You funny!

&gt; Israel is the only country in the world that I know of, which categorizes its own citizens according to their ethnicity on national IDs

Ah, but do you know *why*? Because it faces annihilation from many of it's own citizens if ever they were to become the majority power! Amazing, huh? 

Arabs in Israel have more rights, a higher quality of life, better prospects and higher ratings in every metric of life quality than those in neighbouring states (and don't get me started on how Jews (and Christians for that matter) are treated in countries other than Israel in the region. 

And yet simpletons like you still think that Israel is 'really bad' when they are incomparably better than anywhere else in the region i.e. places you don't criticise for being really bad. It's as if you don't even realise your own hypocrisy and anti-Semitism. Fortunately others reading what you've written in this discussion will see it for you and recognise you for what you are, so don't worry - even by contributing at the level you are you are still making a difference to the debate :-)You'd think he might have filmed some evidence of that if he was there. Still, it [wouldn't be the first time](http://ukmediawatch.org/2015/08/30/telegraph-and-daily-mail-retreat-in-face-of-pallywood-story-about-child-activist/) reporters have tried to make the news. And it would have been a perfectly legitimate act of self defence for the people with guns having rocks thrown at them to fire at the rock throwers. Too bad they only used rubber bullets though."This is the view of a savage" or "These are the views of a savage".

However there is nothing 'savage' about defending yourself against someone throwing rocks at you. David Cameron's four key demands to remain in the EU revealed
David Cameron and his Cabinet allies name their price for Britain to stay part of Europe 



David Cameron and his closest Cabinet allies have drawn up a four-point plan of key demands as the price for keeping Britain in the European Union.

Diplomats have been sent to win support from 27 European countries for a new deal between Britain and Brussels ahead of an \u201cin-out\u201d referendum.

A new campaign will on Monday attempt to persuade voters to choose to stay in the EU, after Eurosceptics who want to pull out of Europe started a rival operation last week. 

 Cabinet sources have told the Telegraph they are confident they can find a way to keep Britain inside the EU with better terms of membership. Their plan involves:

Forcing Brussels to make \u201can explicit statement\u201d that Britain will be kept out of any move towards a European superstate. This will require an exemption for the UK from the EU\u2019s founding principle of \u201cever closer union\u201d.
    An \u201cexplicit statement\u201d that the euro is not the official currency of the EU, making clear that Europe is a \u201cmulti-currency\u201d union. Ministers want this declaration in order to protect the status of the pound sterling as a legitimate currency that will always exist.
    A new \u201cred card\u201d system to bring power back from Brussels to Britain. This would give groups of national parliaments the power to stop unwanted directives being handed down and to scrap existing EU laws.
    A new structure for the EU itself. The block of 28 nations must be reorganised to prevent the nine countries that are not in the eurozone being dominated by the 19 member states that are, with particular protections for the City of London.

Diplomats believe this plan represents the most likely deal they can achieve because it is so difficult to negotiate a solution that is acceptable to 27 other EU member states, as well as the European Commission and the European Parliament. 

Critics, including Cabinet ministers on the Right of the Tory party, are unlikely to be satisfied by this plan because it does not include legally binding changes to the EU\u2019s governing treaties.

But government figures say there is not enough time to deliver treaty changes before the referendum is held, by the end of 2017.

One senior minister said: \u201cOur EU partners are not thanking us. They think we\u2019re barking mad because the thing they all fear most is a referendum on Europe.

\u201cBut they now recognise that we are serious. This is happening and there is no way out. They realise we have to fight together if we are going to keep Britain in the EU.\u201d

In a further development, sources said any hope of major changes to the EU\u2019s migration laws has been all but abandoned because smaller countries such as Hungary, Slovakia and Poland have refused point-blank to consider limits on migrant numbers. This will add weight to the Eurosceptics\u2019 claims that Mr Cameron\u2019s negotiations will fail to deliver meaningful reform.

The outline of Mr Cameron\u2019s negotiating position emerged at a critical time in the debate over whether Britain should stay in the European Union.

On Monday the \u201cIn\u201d campaign will launch its bid to persuade voters to remain part of the EU, backed by Lord Rose, the former Marks &amp; Spencer boss, Lord Mandelson, the former Labour Cabinet minister, and Danny Alexander, who was Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury in the Coalition.

Next week, Mr Cameron will press his case during talks with other European leaders at a summit in Brussels. Over dinner at Chequers on Friday night, he warned Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, that there was \u201cstill much to be worked through\u201d to reach an acceptable deal.

However, the package of changes that Mr Cameron is pursuing is unlikely to deliver the kind of far-reaching revisions to the EU\u2019s legally-binding treaties that Eurosceptic Tories want before the referendum takes place.

Further details of the Prime Minister\u2019s negotiation plan remain secret. In a tactic that has infuriated EU politicians, Downing Street has refused to send a written list of Mr Cameron\u2019s objectives to Brussels.

Ministers fear nations that are hostile to Britain\u2019s renegotiation will try to pick off the proposals one by one. 

 \u201cEvery member state has a \u2018veto\u2019 over whether to accept our proposals. Reforming free movement is a red line for some of the smaller countries,\u201d a senior figure warned.

Ministers are pushing the French and German governments to agree to Britain\u2019s demands as soon as possible.

In private, senior British ministers are urging France and Germany \u2013 the two most powerful EU countries \u2013 that they must speed up the pace of negotiations over a new deal for the UK if they want to keep Britain in the EU. If a deal can be struck at December\u2019s European Council summit, the referendum could be held as early as spring next year. However, as progress continues to be slow, a vote in the autumn of 2016 is regarded as more likely. 

 One senior Tory said: \u201cFrance and Germany both want what they call \u2018the British problem\u2019 to be settled well before they have elections. But if we don\u2019t get a deal until later next year, the referendum will have to be in 2017. They need to up the pace.\u201d

Tory Eurosceptics fear that an early referendum will fail to deliver radical changes. Vague promises of future concessions for Britain may be the best that Mr Cameron can achieve in the time left before a deal is reached, they believe. This would mean no legal guarantee that Britain\u2019s new deal would be honoured.

One leading Eurosceptic minister warned that such an outcome would be unacceptable to Right-wing Tories. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be remotely credible to turn up with a package that could just be thrown out two weeks after the referendum,\u201d the minister said.

Meanwhile, Olivier Blanchard, the outgoing chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, has warned that the eurozone is doomed to fail as plans for common tax and spending policies between countries will fail to bring prosperity to member states. [Angry Harry](http://www.angryharry.com/es-Curse-of-the-NSPCC.htm) has been covering this [for decades](http://www.angryharry.com/esNSPCCNeedsToBeStopped.htm).The kid was 11 years old. Do you have any idea how young that is? You can't make informed decisions on consent at that age and to put a child into a position where they do is a gross abuse of trust. Yes men and women are different but children are children and the reason the age of consent is 16 is to do with maturity, not gender. Protesters hold up placards and campaign for or against things. Murderous thugs throw rocks heavy enough to kill and maim at other people.Exactly. It isn't about blaming the immigrants it is about blaming the scale of immigration. Rule of law is fundamental to libertarian capitalism. You can't have people going around throwing rocks at others without repercussions. If there was a mob throwing rocks in London you can be sure I'd be advocating the same response. Tony Blair, like Margaret Thatcher, won three elections and was far more popular than is made out by the chattering classes in hindsight. I dare say that most people would listen far more to what he is saying and accept his arguments than would deem him toxic and vote against to spite him.This isn't a chicken and egg scenario. For the decades that I've been following the conflict Israel action is without exception a response to Palestinian violence. The security barrier, a response to suicide attacks. The Operation Cast Lead, a response to ongoing rocket attacks against Israel. Operation Protective Edge, a response to further rocket attacks and the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli children by Hamas. Etc.Have to wonder if it can be claimed back under POCA. Doubt they'll get much but it'll be a nuisance for the chappy if he survives his time with ISIS.You can say what you like about Dianne Abbott but at least she's been consistent in her racism over the years. There is no way that Corbyn will make it as far as 2020 as leader. At best he'll attempt to do all of those things, bankrupt the UK and leave us the least prosperous of all the developed nations. At worst he'd alienate our allies, weaken our military and leave us and our peoples at the mercy of states like Russia. Yorkshire master race...Fortunately there isn't even a snowball's chance in Hell of him ever getting into power so I feel especially pleased and envisage a bright future too :-)&gt; He sees the british and the irish as equals in this

WTF? No he doesn't. He sees the Brits as oppressors and the Irish as victims of Imperialist Britain.

&gt; he decries them both

WTF again! He decries them both only when asked specifically about one side and even then only being asked the question five times. 

&gt; He supported a united ireland because that was how it used to be before the british state attacked.

[You don't know your history.

&gt; Only the right wing media could portay a man so commited to non violence he deosn't even eat meat as being pro terrorism.

A man so committed to non-violence he supports and honours terrorists and terrorism? Perhaps you shouldn't stay up so late, not only does it affect your typing it also appears to affect your ability to think logically. He wasn't asked about the British Army, he was asked about IRA bombings. So far as I am aware the British Army didn't engage in any bombings. The fact is that he refused to condemn terrorism without drawing a False equivalence against the Brits fighting it. You don't have to be a genius to figure out who's side he's on (hint, it's not the British side).Interviewer: "Do you unequivocally condemn the IRA bombings?"

Corbyn: "Yes, I do."

It really isn't that hard. Yes, of course they do. But don't forget that [more are happier with their work arrangement](http://www.cipd.co.uk/pm/peoplemanagement/b/weblog/archive/2013/11/26/zero-hours-workers-happier-than-other-employees.aspx) than other employees.You should get out of the conspiracy game and get into poetry ;-)Agreed. We won't see another debate like that as a direct result of how poorly Clegg did.No, I think this is worth considering. I suspect it was a deliberate ploy by the director to make Cruise's character seem a literal underdog who was physically intimidated by the powerful cosa nostra as well as psychologically. It's not something negative against short guys but in many of his other films Cruise is deliberately portrayed as taller than he is and that seems to be a conscious choice not to do that here. I don't think so. In my experience women are generally given a pass and their work is seen as better than it really is, much the same as is the case for tall guys. Very short women or below average guys though do need to work much harder for their better results to be seen as equivalent to the worse results of their taller compatriots. Taller people get promoted despite worse work and shorter people get passed over despite better work. I've seen it consistently over decades across a bunch of industries and sectors. There is a reason that most CEOs are above average height and it has nothing to do with ability. It wasn't negging. Girls don't neg. Your response should be "Actually you'd be surprised at how few girls are that shallow". *That's* negging.&gt; "id so date you if you were short" 

Reply: "And I'd date you if you weren't so shallow!"So you're against the existence of Israel? A believer in a one-state solution? 

It's actually [not the crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_1948_Palestinian_exodus#The_.22Arab_leaders.27_endorsement_of_flight.22_explanation) from which [all other crimes](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XhZfEwcukAMC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=False) flow.No, I'm criticising him for not being willing to condemn the IRA bombings without drawing a False equivalence with the British Army - which has nothing like exactly the same meaning as condemning the IRA bombings, and only someone being deliberately obtuse would suggest otherwise.Few things make me angrier than the state being used against someone who has already suffered. I hope the thugs who did the arrest are seriously reprimanded and the Duluth model is finally abandoned. How hard is it to close the lid? Not only is it more hygienic when you flush but it prevents the arguments in the first place.Guys protesting isn't going to make any difference. Most people don't care about guys. We need women to protest on our behalf, people DO care about women being unhappy.Only a credulous believer of Palestinian-propaganda could believe otherwise.

You could just as easily be talking about feminism, religion, anti-fascism, etc. You're a member of /r/PPD so you're guilty of the exact same thing. It's too broad a church for your argument to make any sense.Don't do it! Guys *say* they like it when women are direct but really it intimidates the Hell out of them. Instead of saying "I want to go back to your place" (which will make them think you're a weirdo who sleeps with anyone), try "If you invited me back to your place I wouldn't say no" (which makes them think that you have singled them out and they can still feel like the 'hunter' by actually being the one to ask).Meh, just thought it'd be interesting. Please delete it if it is against the rules. Thanks."It's got the thumb print reader. Even if I gave you the code it has to be my thumb print. Why don't we meet up and I can do it then?"

/call cops &amp; tell them what a dumbass this guy is"Thanks, you too!"Are domestic violence victims quitters too?The article has cause and effect the wrong way around. People are spending their money on housing because good quality property in the right location is in such high demand but with limited supply. We can't build more homes in Hyde Park and even in the areas where it is possible to build in central London the land price is so high that only the internationally wealthy can afford to live there. We need fewer people in the UK, particularly the London and the South East. Addressing demand is the only way to get prices down when supply is so limited.No one who has spent any time in a Job Centre would ever doubt that there are a lot of awfully entitled scroungers in the world. What speed Internet do they have there? ;-)&gt; Wouldn't you dig your heels in?

No. You're excusing cartel behaviour. If civil servants wanted to go into the private sector there is nothing stopping them. They stay for the job security, the hours, the pension and the perks. But this is a trade off they make willingly and no one is forced into it. 

As it stands, many coming in from the private sector aren't able to adapt to the bureaucracy of the civil service and many only ever intended to stay a short while anyway to broaden their CV so I think the criticism may be exaggerated somewhat. Still, the senior civil service very much is an insiders club and more interested in tokenism and diversity rather than bringing in a higher quality breadth of views and experiences. My comment was more addressing the naysayers in the thread who were saying "I got sanctioned for sneezing!" and other nonsense rather than addressing your original post. That said, it does answer your point to some degree. Go to any Job Centre and spend a few hours there. You'll see dozens if not hundreds of people who have no intention of actually trying to get any of the jobs they supposedly apply for but are quick to kick up a fuss for being made to wait if there is a backlog, they haven't done what they were supposed to or basically anything at all. 

At the same time there are others who turn up on time, wait patiently, bring the right materials and are polite and respectful to those they encounter. Now in a bureaucracy there will inevitably be things that go wrong but a positive attitude tends to be the difference between getting sanctioned and not when that happens. Sure, staff aren't always reasonable but considering the sort of people they have to deal with and how little they get paid that is to be expected. But if you see the same people each week the more effort you put into making that interaction a positive one the better it will play out for you on average over time. &gt; Again, not in the view of the court.

The judge misdirected the jury, so you're right that this wasn't the view of the court but that doesn't make the view of the court correct. 

&gt; The point with McDonald is that he had prior reasonable belief in consent. If he had not had such, then he would have been convicted as well, as in the view of the jury consent could not have been given at the point where they were having sex.

This argument *necessarily* means that she wasn't in a fit state to consent when McDonald had sex with her. It's an exercise in doublethink and absolute bullshit. Not to mention that people that are no longer drinking tend to sober up, making her later consent *more* likely to be informed, not less.

&gt; The witnesses clearly on the side of the defendant.

There were no witnesses at the time on the side of defendant. Just the hotel supervisor who got duped by Evans and who later said he overheard clearly enthusiastic consensual sex and who's testimony about the alleged victim being incapacitated is directly contradicted by the video evidence. 

&gt; Tiredness and continued absorption of alcohol from drinking would take a toll, as would the exertion of sex. It would take approx two hours for her blood alcohol to begin dropping, so at the point of Evans arriving, she would still likely be in a deteriorating mental condition.

This depends when she stopped drinking and I do concede that whilst the video evidence of her at the club shows her drinking until about two hours before the incident it isn't inconceivable that her condition continued to deteriorate to the point she had sex with Evans. There is however sufficient uncertainty to constitute reasonable doubt.

&gt; You claim no ill-feeling towards the victim, that you merely dislike the injustice. But you are not being honest, either with yourself or with me, i am unsure.

Allow me to clarify. I feel no ill feeling towards the alleged victim for her actions that evening. I don't hold it against her that she is a slut. I don't even hold it against her that she was distressed about not remembering what happened the night before. Not remembering who you agreed to have sex with can be upsetting even for a slut. However, what I do hold against her is that having been informed of the events of the night and having seen her making decisions that had they resulted in her getting behind the wheel of a car instead of having sex with a professional athlete would have resulted in a potential custodial sentence for her that she didn't withdraw her accusation and refuse to cooperate with the prosecution. 

&gt; 'a lying slapper'? That is not the language of outrage at an injustice, surely, that appears to be using the alleged promiscuity of the victim as an insult and tying it to unreliability in her claim.

It very much is the language of outrage, and indeed was typed in anger at the injustice.

&gt; In my view you are not merely on the side of justice here, you are being partisan, you have picked a side and it distorts your view of events. The law is clear. This case is clear. 

I am partisan on the side of justice and against injustice. I have picked a side *because* it is the side of justice. The irony of you saying the law is clear and the case is clear is not lost that Evans asked for consent and obtained it at a time when she could be demonstrably shown to be capable of giving consent by actually engaging in sex and yet he was still convicted is not lost on me.

&gt; Evans was text by McDonald 'i've got a bird', and neither man gave a fuck about whether she was capable of consent. 

That is *your* partisanship. It is ludicrous beyond belief to suggest that neither McDonald nor Evans cared about her ability to consent. Do you think either one wanted to be accused of rape? Do you think they weren't aware of what the consequences of raping someone are? Even the accusation alone is enough to destroy careers. Neither man would have risked his career, freedom and good name to have sex with some drunk slapper unless they absolutely believed they had informed and meaningful consent. 

&gt; Let us see what happens. Evans is backed by far more wealth and power than his victim, so he may well be able to parlay that into some kind of reasonable doubt after reams of character assassination are submitted.

I wish him all the luck in the world. But even if the original conviction is quashed as it should be he has still lost his prime years and literally millions of pounds of potential income, his life has been destroyed and he can't get back the years he spent in prison. It is this injustice that makes me so angry at the 'lying slapper' and it could so easily happen to anyone that has ever had a one night stand involving alcohol. The case should never have been brought to court let alone resulted in a conviction. It isn't so much a case of the law being an ass, it's more the law being a politicised tool to secure convictions if it is all possible to do so regardless of whether they are warranted or not.&gt; So a groomed child who 'consents' won't suffer trauma?

There is a bit of a difference between a couple of kids playing doctors and nurses and an adult grooming a child.&gt; People are spending their money on housing because they need somewhere to live, surely?

No. People are spending their money on housing *because they want to live in a particular place*.

&gt; Also lol at reducing demand that's great for the economy

It wasn't supposed to be a solution that was great for the economy, it was supposed to be a solution that was good for reducing house prices. Considering we aren't building enough and can't build enough where demand is highest addressing demand is the next step if policy makers want to reduce house prices. &gt; Unparalleled is perhaps a little strong

It isn't a little strong at all. No other state has anything like approaching the soft power the UK does. Our reach and influence far surpasses our economic or military strength as anyone who understands international relations can attest.The reason Australia is able to exist as a second rate power is because other states, like Britain and the US, provide a bulwark against those who would otherwise threaten Australian interests."Politicians in child grooming scandal!"Read it again. He isn't saying they aren't harmed, he's saying that they aren't necessarily harmed and may be more harmed by reactions to it than by the actual event. &gt; Yeah people only live places because they want to, not for the convenience of being near jobs.

People live where they want to because it is convenient for their jobs.

&gt; If people acted rationally then everyone would be living in the middle of Wales because it's cheap as fuck, but turns out it's an incredibly inconvenient commute to where the work is.

And some smart people have caught onto that and telecommute. Not everyone can, of course, and that is part of the reason that accommodation is so expensive near where the jobs are. 

&gt; And we can build more where demand is highest, we're just not doing anything helpful there.

We can, but the land being so expensive means that only the super rich can afford to live there. 

&gt; Local authorities are selling off land that's being built on, but they're building the wrong things, e.g. the Heygate and Aylsbury estate regeneration projects in South London being sold off to Lend Lease for \u00a3fuckall and turned from masses of cheap local authority owned housing into a series of unaffordable developments, or the "\u00a3800,000 for a studio flat" Battersea development.

As I just stated, land is expensive where people want to live. Actually, I was quite impressed with how you put yourself across on this highly emotive topic. It's inevitable that feelings will be running high yet you've engaged civilly and used logic (or at least attempted to do so ;-) in your arguments. I suspect you are right though that we aren't going to find common ground, although I do have to ask if Evans were to be acquitted on appeal would it change your stance at all?

Also, I will explain what you interpret as an inconsistency over my not judging her for her actions on the night but referring to her as a slut and a slapper after the fact. Aside from the fact that I use these terms as descriptors, absent of value judgement but to accurately describe her behaviour, so to do I simultaneously hold anger for her later actions of Falsely accusing the two men of rape and as such am happy to use descriptors that she may interpret as hostile or negative towards her. In other words, I am happy to cause her offence but there aren't words in English that do so regarding False accusations but there are so regarding her sexual habits so if the descriptors have that effect it's all to the good.&gt; Nobody has said anything of the sort. you're using a False equivalency to obfuscate the discussion.

/sigh

This is the problem when I assume intelligence on the part of other participants. I didn't mean sanctioned for sneezing literally, I meant the inadequate excuses that people have been positing like being late. 

&gt; If you don't know any of them and don't have any numbers, you aren't answering the question at all.

You asked for a more detailed contribution and I'm giving you one. I'm not going to name specific individuals for your benefit. Suffice to say that empirical data is still data.

&gt; I happen to know from both personal and anecdotal experience that the member of staff you get is far more important than your demeanour in whether you get sanctioned.

No doubt, but your demeanour to said individual cannot be said to be an irrelevant factor either.

&gt; If your staff member is incompetent, are you not more likely to become frustrated?

Yes, but just as I am getting frustrated with your efforts in this debate, it is important to engage civilly.

&gt; Surely your mood should not affect a sanction system that is supposed to have a framework in place. Is mood something they score on now?

People are flawed and you're dealing with a person. Take account of the fact that they have to deal with entitled scroungers all day and go out of your way to brighten their day by having all of the paperwork you might need with you and up to date.

&gt; ultimately, it doesn't seem like you want to participate properly here, just making blanket statements and False equivalents, or throwing up invalid information. Thanks for your time, but I will leave it there.

I made an initial point, followed it up with more detail as you requested and am still making the effort to engage despite your dismissal of my observations as invalid, blanket and False equivalence. If you can't handle it that sometimes people engage outside of the parameters you attempted to impose in your initial post then maybe the Internet isn't for you?Then we end up with lower quality average housing stock that ends up more expensive than cheaper homes because local authorities aren't governed by the profit motive to the extent that private developers are. I'm not sure you've actually understood the point being made from what you just wrote. He isn't arguing that it isn't traumatic, just that in some cases it may be that the reaction to it is more traumatic than the event, which makes perfect sense. How many people lose their virginity before 16 in the UK? 20%? 30% More? Either way it is a lot and telling these people that they've all been raped and treating them like victims when they might not regard themselves as such may well be significantly more traumatic than having had sex before they were 16 in many cases. I honestly don't see how anyone could think otherwise?&gt; He does not distinguish between cases of teens having sex and abuse by an adult of a child, or a teen.

Because he relies on the person experiencing it to be the only person capable of determining what it means for them. You saying that "the mental structure of their life" has been "destroyed" may not be their experience and you saying that it *is* their experience may *make* it their experience, not because of the initial event but because of your reaction about how they should feel about it. 

Firstly, developers work to a profit motive, local authorities simply don't face that same pressure and as a result costs for cheaper housing can quickly escalate and you end up with poorer quality accommodation that cost more to produce. Also, producing such low quality homes drives down the average quality of UK housing stock. This means that anything better than that becomes more desirable and hence more expensive. This pushing up the cost of housing over time has an effect on all house prices. Thus we end up with more expensive, worse quality housing over time. I hate to be the one to break it to you, but if you think it is stupid then you haven't understood the point.I don't see how it would be possible to achieve an acquittal on character assassination as her testimony has already been submitted. Also, as I have already stated, I believe her memory loss was genuine, so unless she was found to have posted to told someone that she lied to get a big payout I would imagine that any acquittal must be a result of new evidence (perhaps they've retrieved the recordings that the two players outside the room made on their phones showing the enthusiastic consent?) or on a new point of law. 

I still disagree with your moral criticisms as women can and do lose their inhibitions after drinking and actively want to engage in behaviour that they otherwise wouldn't and guys who are so inclined shouldn't be subject to charges of rape for going along with what the women in such situations want, but I respect that I'm not going to change your mind. I'm just glad that you're open minded about the legal side of things. It's been a good discussion. Have another upvote!&gt; surely someone of your caliber could see that reducing other's experiences to such a statement would cause things do derail. Are you able to point out these inadequate excuses in this thread?

*calibre

I already did e.g. being late.

&gt; I haven't asked for names, I've asked for numbers. You haven't given any on any part of the question.

Like I said, sometimes people provide input from outside the parameters you attempt to set. You just have to live with it.

&gt; So you believe that my mood should affect whether I get sanctioned or not.

Should? No. Does? Yes.

&gt; I thought the purpose of sanctions was to prevent people gaming the system, not to punish people for being lippy. Do you agree?

No, I don't agree. I think that sanctions are also used to browbeat jobseekers into behaviour that is civil, tolerant of authority and otherwise conducive to gainful employment. 

&gt; I apologise for frustrating you, it is not my intention. I agree wholeheartedly that people should engage civilly, but I disagree that sanctions should be applied based on this.

You haven't really frustrated me, I was just making a point. And again it isn't about whether things should or shouldn't be this way it is about the fact that they are this way.

&gt; These people are paid to do a job, and do it properly.

And they *should* do it properly but they don't always.

&gt; Yes, humans are flawed but this is not a viable argument for the sanction system being a successful one.

It's not an argument, it's an explanation.

&gt; I apologise if I have offended you with my dismissal of your points.

Apology accepted, and I return that apology with my own for deviating from your intent for the discussion. I maintain that it doesn't make my points any less relevant or valid though as I think it is worthwhile considering the bigger picture. I was half expecting a V-mask and neckbeard superimposed on the dear lady herself. Can't say whether I am disappointed or relived that it wasn't."Malinese girls are unsuitable as nurses. These brown-eyed, dark-skinned people have never met a white person before."&gt; It is not a sane response to a grooming victim to reinforce their manipulated worldview.

And yet the age of consent is different in different states. Does one states victim become another states consensual participant and vice versa? Besides which, at what age does the offence matter under US style Romeo and Juliet laws and why the cut off where it is when people mature at differing ages? The point is valid and you attempting to turn it into an argument that abuse isn't abuse is just reaching.

&gt; It isn't subjective, really, that a major change in worldview is likely to be traumatic.

Well at least we're in agreement about that. You might not like it but it is True that underage sex isn't always harmful. Now grooming and abuse are illegal but to assume all 15 year old's aren't emotionally capable of consenting is as ludicrous as assuming all 16 year old's are. 

Also, he doesn't assert that grooming isn't as bad as violent sexual abuse and that no harm occurs, he states that in some cases it isn't as bad for the victim, which is doubtless correct.I wish I had your faith. The EU is a cumbersome, bureaucratic, burdensome, unnecessary, juggernaut that will inevitably fail sooner rather than later and the longer we stay with it the worse our fall will be. It is a project unbeloved and uninterested in benefiting the people it ostensibly exists for but is instead a vanity project for the elites who think their views should be imposed on the people and have usurped this democratically deficient system to that advantage and as such will use every trick in the book to ensure that Britain stays in.[Cosmo writes a good article?](http://41.media.tumblr.com/66dbcf1c55f35e570cfd463942111ded/tumblr_mt0vcsuitU1sh0lomo1_1280.jpg)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VILgSsesD0It's as if they have deliberately ignored murder and violence by proxy, which is odd for an otherwise very good and well referenced article by Cathy Young.Speaking up can cost you your career and correspondingly your home, family, etc. It is a big deal. &gt; Grooming is inherently harmful.

Not all underage sex is grooming.

&gt; It isn't doubtless correct. It is completely incorrect, in some cases.

That's what I said. Read it again.

&gt; The guy is a paedophile apologist, promoting the myth that the only real rape is violent rape, but applying it to children.

No he isn't. He's saying that when an 18 year old and a 15 year old have sex it isn't automatically grooming and it doesn't automatically mean the 15 year old will be mentally scarred by it.

&gt; His article Tea abuse is particularly disgusting

It makes the same point, that hysteria over something can result in more trauma about something than if there wasn't hysteria about the thing. Not really. There's Queen Bees and Wannabees, obviously, and some stuff about Parental Alienation Syndrome but I don't think there is a great deal about getting guys to fight, hiring thugs/assassins or the sort of manipulation from films like The Last Seduction.["Hey - he's convinced me. Give me my dollar back."](https://moviediners.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/restaurant-reservoir-dogs-1992-01-g.jpg)&gt; This prick doesn't differentiate of course.

Because it should be obvious which he is referring to.

&gt; My point is that it [grooming] is not inherently less harmful [than violent rape].

There are circumstances where either can be more harmful, but again the author isn't talking about grooming, he's talking about sex where one participant is under the legal age of consent.

&gt; He blames people trying to protect children for the perception that child abuse causes serious harm. He is a paedophile apologist.

No, he blames people who claim they are trying to protect children but are actually making things worse for them for making things worse for them. That isn't a paedophile apologist.

&gt; He pines for a world where teachers could assault children to enforce their will.

No, he pines for a world where teachers don't have to live in fear of losing their career for defending themselves against violence which is hardly the same thing.

&gt; It also illustrates his level of conviction that paedophilia is just a lot of fuss over nothing.

No, just like with our discussion about rape demonstrating that there are differing degrees of rape so to are there different degrees of paedophilia and an 18 year old sleeping with a 15 year old isn't the same as a 50 year old sleeping with a 10 year old. Pointing out this difference doesn't make one a paedophile apologist.

&gt; You can sometimes judge a cause by it's enemies, and frankly, if this guy hates feminists that much, they kind of look like they're on the side of the angels to me.

That's because they portray themselves as the good guys even though they are not. But again, I don't see that I'm going to convince you of that, you'll just have to realise it yourself in the fullness of time. To "come out"? Was Winton agoraphobic or something?Interesting that The Guardian chose to run with a picture of a defaced Holocaust memorial day advert. Then again, unless they wanted to show an actual victim of crime what else could they show?&gt; -0.1% is ~~literally~~ *virtually* nothing though.

FTFY.&gt; That's creepy as fuck, because the is exactly the kind of shit paedophiles tell themselves. I bolded rather than italicised it so it didn't look like you'd said that, that's how much his statement bothers me.

The sentence is missing a "necessarily" after the "not" but it isn't exactly hard to infer the meaning, which is not that child rape doesn't cause harm but that but that more harm may be caused by making a big deal out of something they wouldn't otherwise have considered a big deal. 

&gt; he isn't very specific about the age of either participant. Grooming is how most children abused by adults are treated

I doubt that very much. I would be astonished if most child/adult sex wasn't grooming but much rather kids at the same school one from the sixth form and one from year 11. 

&gt; I don't see how he can be considered not to be covering grooming, really.

Because grooming isn't even mentioned. It's obviously a separate thing. 

&gt; Yeah, damn those social services and children's charities, making such a fuss when folk fuck kids.

It's one thing to try and stop it from happening, it's another to make Brass Eye look like a documentary.

&gt; he talks lovingly of the idea of pinning a pupil against a wall and taking their property when they defy a teacher.

Confiscation of mobile phones is hardly North Korea. 

&gt; He bitches about how most of the trauma of child abuse is entirely a construct of the NSPCC/feminists. Which is bullshit, as I note - behavioural abnormalities are present prior to any intervention, and so the damage cannot be considered to be a mere social convention.

I think you are misguided if you don't think charities and feminists don't attempt to maximise the trauma of child abuse to further their own ends. I also think you are misguided if you don't think maximising the trauma affects those who experienced the trauma in a negative way. I even further think you are misguided if you don't think feminists and charities aren't aware of this and do it anyway in order to push their agenda. 

&gt; seriously, this guy is just downright wrong

Hardly. People can and do suffer from PTSD from childhood abuse, of course, but this can be exacerbated by those who supposedly support the victims emphasising how bad it is. There is nothing wrong about this point. The first example doesn't have any detail about the job, hours worked, performance, experience, etc. It just refers to "male colleagues" who may or may not have received performance related pay.

Your second example specifically states:

&gt; A better performer, he reasons, should be rewarded far more than the average worker.

And also that:

&gt; Colleagues, meanwhile, were successfully negotiating new salaries based on information from the [shared salary] spreadsheet

...which explains the reason for the culture and not releasing this stuff.&gt; Many women are very well qualified and don't get the role or the opportunity because they are women.

If that were True then competing companies that hired the women would outperform the companies that don't and as the evidence cited in the study shows us this isn't happening.&gt; No, it isn't mentioned. Because his division of child abuse is simply violent (real) and non-violent (not harmful). Grooming abuse is usually non-violent at least initially, so clearly he lumps it in with the not so bad type of raping kids.

I've already gone into why this is a misrepresentation, suffice to repeat that it isn't saying all non-violent abuse is non-harmful.

&gt; Violent restraint for verbal defiance? It's not exactly benign or responsible behaviour from a teacher, either.

Verbal defiance can range from saying "No" to threats to kill. Again, I don't think it is helpful to straw man.

&gt; Experience would suggest otherwise, a great deal of care seems to be taken to minimise trauma, as far as possible. Anyone would think this guy is blinded by his agenda.

Experience would very much not suggest otherwise. Funding, influence and power all come from maximising trauma and saying "look how bad this trauma is! We need more resources to fight it!"

&gt; I wasn't using hyperbole, I would not leave a this guy alone with kids.

Don't tell me I need to explain to you as well that that Brass Eye episode I referred to earlier was satire too?&gt; women are underrepresented in positions of power and it isn't all down to merit, there are inherent biases there.

This is necessarily unTrue. If it were True then as I stated above, companies would do worse with men and better with women but the [reverse is True](https://c4mb.wordpress.com/improving-gender-diversity-on-boards-leads-to-a-decline-in-corporate-performance-the-evidence/).

As for the downvotes, I can only apologise on behalf of the people on my side of the debate. I don't downvote for disagreement and think that you were contributing to the discussion so have upvoted you even though I disagree with you. &gt; I think saying women have to out perform men in order to demonstrate bias seems like a forced link

It's not that they have to or not, it's that if they did perform better it would be demonstrable.

&gt; you can't attribute reduced performance purely on there being more women (as in the women are worse, it could be their presence means men perform worse)

Perhaps if it were performing life or death manoeuvres in the army the sex of the participants may be a factor, but it has been [shown not to be the case in competitive environments](http://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/Gender.pdf) such as the boardroom. Unless you were referring to the [effect of increased testosterone affecting risk-taking behaviour](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/200905/interacting-women-makes-men-stupid) when men are exposed to attractive women?

&gt; I know this is more anecdotal, but have you spoken to women about this issue? All my personal experience suggests women experience issues and barriers at work that men don't face and would struggle to understand. 

Yes, I've debated the issue with women of all political stripes many times and have a thorough understanding of the differences in perception that women face in terms of everything from expressing assertiveness to challenging authority. /r/FeMRADebates is particularly good for this kind of discussion and their is a great deal of cited evidence and arguments about the topic there and if you feel like discussing the topic where it won't get downvoted but will be engaged with constructively I can't recommend it enough. That said, women's experience tends to consistently assume that the workplace is set up for the benefit of men and ignores the selfsame issues and barriers at work that men do face and women struggle to understand (and men often even don't admit to themselves e.g. what feminists refer to as "The Patriarchy hurts men too!").

&gt; Cheers, I feel it's hard to stick up for women on this sub sometimes, people just downvote you and it's frustrating! 

I've noticed it's gotten worse for lefties in the past week or so regarding downvoting. Sometimes this sub just has particularly partisan moments from time to time. I think there are a couple of pillocks that rub people up the wrong way and it starts a tit for tat downvoting for disagreement mentality. Fortunately not everyone is affected and I've had some particularly good discussions on extremely contentious issues with the likes of /u/yetieater and /u/artismyhustle of late without either side downvoting which has been gratifying. Hopefully it'll pass and we'll all soon revert to better ways.&gt; 1) I get that, my point is they don't have to perform better in order to demonstrate bias. 

Not as individuals but you would expect there to be at least some evidence on average showing that they were better if they, in fact, were better.

&gt; 2) Yes I was referring to that kind of issue, I also think women might be less competitive or ruthless then men (not commenting on whether that's good or not just a generalisation for the sake of this debate). 

Certainly women aren't under anything like the same pressure as men to succeed. They aren't judged on their career in the way that men are. Plus women tend to prioritise differently. I wouldn't say women are less competitive or ruthless than men (if anything I'd say they were much more so) but this doesn't always translate into the workplace and career advancement. 

&gt; 3) I'll check it out thanks :). I certainly think the workplace might be set up in favour of men but I don't think it would be necessarily a conscious thing. Humans just do what is comfortable, a more men heavy environment is going to be more comfortable for men, and visa versa.

Do check it out, I think it'll be right up your street. I disagree about humans doing what is comfortable however. Comfort is a luxury that is only taken into consideration when it serves output. The workplace is set up in favour of performance, not men. A more diverse workplace makes no difference for men unless it's like policing/military where there are physical dangers to be face and men's innate need to defend and sacrifice themselves for women affects operational ability. 

&gt; I agree the patriarchy as you say does hurt men, this is the case in stuff like gender roles (stay at home dad's) and mental health (stuff upper lip and that). 

The Patriarchy as envisioned by feminism doesn't exist. There is no system that benefits men at the expense of women nor has there historically ever been. The opposite is closer to the truth. Gender roles are a result of evolutionary biology and systems have evolved evolutionarily to benefit the species rather than one gender (and in practice this means keeping women safe at the expense of men, who have always been expendable). 

&gt; 4) Ah fair enough, I hope so too. This sub can be great but difficult on certain issues, immigration, animal rights and women's issues is when I notice the downvoting tends to happen. 

I've spent more time lately upvoting stuff I disagree with than stuff I agree with to address this!&gt; That, however, is different from the approach of professionals seeking to protect children.

That is disingenuous, it is indeed a different approach but the same result. 

&gt; To believe creepy harry's position you have to accept that hundreds of thousands of people have decided to subvert the very reason they likely went into youthwork or child protection in order to advance a conspiracy.

They don't see it as a conspiracy though, they see it as furthering the cause.

&gt; It is not a lucrative field

Exactly. People only get into it if they are ideologically motivated to.

&gt; I cannot see any chance of this occurring - if they wanted money they wouldn't be in the field.

They don't want money for themselves, they want money for power, influence and to further the cause.

&gt; he exhibits a remarkable insouciance about violence towards kids, speaking fondly of the idea of pinning a pupil to a wall to confiscate a phone following a refusal to obey a demand.

What is your proposed alternative if a pupil disrupts lessons and refuses to stop doing so?

&gt; Punishment might be warranted for disobedience, but physical dominance being the first resort?

It doesn't say it should be the first resort (although actually there is a good argument for doing so *pour encourager les autres*).

&gt; He also voices the rationalisations claimed by most older paedophiles, the ideas that children can provide some degree of consent to abuse, and that they do not suffer in non-violent abuse.

As already repeatedly explained that is a misrepresentation of the argument and position. Think about Traci Lords, for example. Or the sentences handed out by courts to female teachers who prey on their pupils. 

&gt; This is not a set of views i would be comfortable leaving in charge of children.

You not being comfortable with reality doesn't make it incorrect. But I'm not trying to convince you to hire him as a babysitter, just to understand and not misrepresent the argument being made.&gt; 1) I don't think they are better, I just don't think they are worse, or at the very least, worse enough to explain the underrepresentation of women in roles of power. 

Well, it is a binary. Either they are better or they aren't. 

&gt; 2) I wouldn't say women are more ruthless or competitive then men, though I agree these traits are maybe put onto men more then women. 

Have you seen the film Mean Girls or read the book it was based on? 

&gt; 3) I mean humans tend to gravitate to or create environments that suit them more, it's not just in a military sense, it might be in the culture of the workplace for example. 

It is the rewards from making sacrifices that make the sacrifice worthwhile. The sacrifice still needs to be made to obtain the reward and the sacrifice doesn't care anything about comfort or culture.

&gt; 4) I don't agree with that. Society in the majority of cultures throughout history have massively favoured men! Women only got the vote 100 or so years ago for example. 

Societies have historically favoured the elite, men were the slaves, the soldiers and the sacrifices literally dying  to keep the women safe in every civilisation prior to universal suffrage. It's called 'the glass floor' that men were kept down and the 'apex fallacy' that women historically have their position compared to the elite at the top of society and not to the men that supported them. Men, too, only got the vote 100 years or so ago for example.&gt; 1) Or they could perform roughly the same? Either way you're not getting my point I feel.

If they are all performing roughly the same, then it isn't an issue.

&gt; 2) Yes, how's that relevant? Great film though! 

The book it is based on, Queen Bees and Wannabees, is an extensive study into female aggression, competitive behaviour and ruthlessness. It demonstrates categorically that women are innately different to men in how they express these attributes and hypothesises about what this means and the results it has. Suffice to say, that there are significant gender differences and that statistically vastly different numbers of men and women at the top levels makes sense. 

&gt; 3) I don't think we're talking about the same thing here. By 'comfortable' I'm not talking about it like a sofa is comfortable. I mean an environment that is best for you.

We are very much talking about the same thing here i.e. an environment based on what is best for delivering results, not one that is best for the people working there. Too many people seem to mistake an environment where workers are able to produce their best results with one that is a comfortable space for men but these are not the same thing at all. 

&gt; 4) The elite mainly made up of men - which is the whole point of this conversation! Men were voting before women, we both know this. 

No, the elite has rarely been made up of men, although it has frequently had men at the pinnacle. It's usually the top five percent of men and the top 15% of women as totals of the population.

He wasn't wearing a watch.Credit to The Mirror for covering the story. Fortunately most disabled, trans, Asian homosexuals in Oldham *did* vote UKIP, hence their share of the vote.Downvotes for opinions stifle debate. I've certainly stopped contributing to contentious topics because people were downvoting for disagreement rather than quality of contribution and I think the gripe is valid, not 'salty'. That said, I think /u/NB may have been downvoted for slatting Trump without saying which of his policies were hateful and dangerous as well as why they were so.When it is only 13% of the population and doesn't involve enacting violence against others I'm prepared to be tolerant whether I agree with it or not.How about explaining *why* you think this view is ignorant?/u/LtSlow isn't a rabid UKIP hater and has informed and logically sound views on immigration, Farage, the EU and Islam from what I've seen. I believe the point he is making (and I'm happy to be corrected if I am mistaken) is that many UKIP supporters and party members do note that Islam has intrinsic problems that make it face inevitable conflict with a democratic society.Guy Ritchie's "Ganja, AK47 and Two Suicide Bombers"!&gt; Trump's comment was that Sharia police walk around attacking people for things like carrying alcohol. That's obviously bullshit.

[I'm afraid it isn't bullshit at all.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_patrols)

EDIT: 19 [downvotes](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3w2jsm/strong_british_opposition_to_trumps_views_but/cxt1fnj) for providing sourced evidence that this happened? WTF r/UKpolitics???Actually, neither poverty and existing criminal elements separately or together lead to radicalisation. It isn't an explanation and it isn't adequate to explain the prisons and crime statistics numbers. Racism can go part way to doing so, but so to can culture, specifically that 'whitey' deserves it for historical reasons, which instead of being ridiculed for the trite racism it actually is, is taken seriously by too many people in positions of authority who should know better.Only a moron would think that was what I am saying. I was responding to your comment that I quoted. You said it was bullshit. It wasn't bullshit. Welsh *Assembly* if you're going to be pedantic. If the Welsh want it, then it should be funded by Welsh taxpayers, not Westminster.&gt; ~~Unf~~*F*ortunately the 'vast' social housing supply has been declining since the 80's

FTFY. Zone 1/2 is expensive. Those who cannot afford it shouldn't be subsidised to live in the most desirable parts of the capital by those who would like to but can't afford it themselves.

&gt; You could export the feckless away from London but that's only going to have a small impact and merely move the problem down the road instead of solving it.

It would certainly be a good first step. There are plenty of places cheaper than central London even within commuter distance.Because other people want to live there and are paying their taxes to enable those who couldn't afford to live there if they weren't subsidised to do so.It would not be difficult to fund the Welsh Assembly via Welsh Council Taxes and it would demonstrate categorically what the real level of demand for it was.I wasn't talking about what Trump was saying, I was addressing the comment made by the poster above. No, it would mean that the Welsh Assembly was paid for by the Welsh and that they could control it's budget and spending, giving more autonomy than at present and it would be simple to administer because council tax is collected by local authorities so would be extremely practical to implement.A job is only economically viable if it produces sufficient value to be worth the employer hiring someone to do the work. You can't just demand employers pay people more than they are worth, they just won't employ people if they aren't getting a return on the value of having an employee. And it was a straw man, so I pointed out that it wasn't in fact bullshit at all and provided the evidence that demonstrated this (and got downvoted to Hell for providing a factually correct rebuttal).No, there would be no rebate as it wouldn't be fair. The Welsh Assembly is *in addition* to matters that can be dealt with nationally, not *instead of*. Undoubtedly, but it isn't always good natured and it can't always be overcoming by not letting it get to you. You know what being short is like *for you*. You don't speak for everyone else as they will have experiences that differ mildly to wildly from your own. 

As for posting on the Internet not making you feel more confident, I don't think you fully understand the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of heightism if you think that is the case. It is still taboo to acknowledge heightism even exists in most of real life so having forums like this where people can vent makes a massive, massive difference to many people.

And the self-beliefs here aren't limiting either. They acknowledge that discrimination exists but also demonstrate that self-worth doesn't come from height regardless of how much and how many other people attempt to impose the notion that it does.That completely ignores my point. A job's economic viability is not determined by whether the CEO can take a pay cut to cover it, it is determined by the market competitive rate for the work in relation to the returns the work offers. No wonder you don't understand if you are looking at this from a redistributivist perspective! At the risk of repeating myself his exact words were:

&gt; Trump's comment was that Sharia police walk around attacking people for things like carrying alcohol. That's obviously bullshit.

I pointed out that this wasn't bullshit because [it is True](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/dec/06/muslim-vigilantes-jailed-sharia-law-attacks-london) and exactly what happened.You forgot the most important bit, that it is *if and only if* they voluntarily decide to opt for it. If a thing (devolution) has a cost and the people who will benefit from that thing want that thing then they should pay the cost, not others who won't benefit from that thing.What you are actually doing is actually quite worthy and a lot better than most tall guys do precisely because they like to feel their accomplishments are their own rather than because of an arbitrary quality they have no control over. Keep up the good work.It doesn't need to come from central funding though and there is no good reason for it to. It needs to come from higher taxes because it needs to be paid for somehow and the only fair way is that those who benefit from it pay for it. As council tax is collected at a local level this would be an easy way to make the Welsh Assembly accountable to Welsh taxpayers and ensure that they are prioritising Welsh taxpayers money effectively instead of spending on pet projects which are only allowed because the money isn't coming just from Welsh taxpayers and Assembly Members would be booted out of office for doing so if they were spending just Welsh taxpayers money. Red lines are discussed prior to shooting. Haven't you ever seen an interview with the participants? &gt; other companies paying a pittance shouldn't be seen as an excuse for you to do so

Yes it SHOULD. In fact, it MUST. Otherwise your business will not be competitive and will fail whereas competitive businesses will succeed. 

&gt; if you could afford to pay your staff a decent living wage, but don't because other companies don't then you are heartless

No, no, NO! That simply isn't how things work. You pay more for the right staff and if you can afford to pay more that means your staff are doing things according to your instructions effectively and so are desirable for your competitors and should be paid more because you want to retain them, not out of kindness.

&gt; in situations like this it's time to raise the bar and not see how collectively low it can be kept

This already happens, it's called [labour competition](http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Competitive_labour_markets.html).

&gt; No wonder you don't understand my point if you are looking at this from a perspective of run away capitalism.

I do understand your point but your point is objectively wrong. It depends on how the brawl was started as to who is in the right and who is in the wrong, but in my experience prison warders don't start fights with inmates because it could cost them their job, health or even life. This is great news and I can't believe it hasn't happened sooner. Social housing is supposed to be for the needy, not those who just happen to be enjoying it but could easily afford the private sector. That profit is for the shareholders, not employees. Although any emlpoyee can buy shares.Best all-rounder at that price will be a BMW 3 series.

Best for luxury will be a Jaguar XJ.

Best for sportiness is the Audi TT.The Jaguar XE is the best car you can get at that budget, by quite a significant margin. If you just want lots of gadgetry just go for a high specification Hyundai.That's funny, because I'm not the one who isn't living in the real world. The reason these companies make money is because share holders are confident that they will enough to put their own money in to them with the expectation of receiving a return on the risk of that investment. Without that, the company has no money and the employees have no jobs. And every individual has to make sacrifices and take risks to get ahead and that includes minimum wage employees.To be fair to them, many of them aren't actually close-minded, they've just genuinely not been fully exposed to both sides of the argument having been indoctrinated during their school years to think of it as a battle between good and evil and not a trade off of preferences and positions no matter which option you choose. Isn't the point that they don't care? Doesn't that make the stuff about women making up 50% of MP's pointless and redundant? If the so-called oppressors don't actually oppress and do actually represent the diversity of their constituent's interests, that makes what Philips said idiotic. &gt; if they cared about these issues they could bring them up in any debate.

Could they? I doubt it. Men's issues are widely ridiculed and promoting them at the expense of the opportunity to promote women's issues would be a quick way to lose your seat. 

&gt; They don't. So demonstrably men don't have issues.

This is as ridiculous as saying women didn't have issues before the suffrage movement.&gt; Women aren't selected as candidates/elected by people as often are men.

They are *selected* MORE. They don't stand as often because the costs of doing so are too high. 

In terms of access, woman have *far greater* access to Parliament as MPs but elect not to take advantage of their greater access because of the sacrifices required to do so in relation to the benefits it yields. Actually, women outnumber men in the UK and vote more than men, so they are above 50% on both counts. &gt; The fact there is a stark contrast shows that there likely glass ceilings etc. 

No it doesn't. The sacrifices necessary to become an MP are significant and female candidates are given preference at every stage of the process so that parties can demonstrate their gender diversity. Women aren't stupid though and recognise the massive commitment and costs associated with becoming a career politician and after weighing up the pros and cons few elect to pursue it. That is NOT evidence of discrimination though. Evidence of discrimination is women only shortlists. A statistical differentiation could be for a multitude of reasons, none of which are discrimination.People do vote for their local MP based on their party leader though so even if they don't directly vote for PM that may well be their intent.From Valerie Solinas to Bahar Mustafa. Didn't realise they'd introduced all-male shortlists. Can you provide a link?But that's Diane's *whole identity*!Marlon Brando. He's widely considered one of the greats and has had some good roles (Streetcar, Waterfront, Godfather, etc.) but the roles made him great rather than how he filled them. I think Apocalypse Now, Superman and The Apaloosa most accurately reflect his limited range, and films like Don Juan DeMarco, Last Tango in Paris and Mutiny on the Bounty reveal his shortcomings as an actual actor when offered potential range.Perhaps you genuinely aren't aware of this, but men [didn't have representation before suffrage](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11509811/Why-has-everyone-forgotten-about-male-suffrage.html). Also, you completely missed the point which was that just because a group doesn't raise issues doesn't mean the group doesn't have issues. What difference does it make if those in Parliament are not acting in the interests of their fellow man? Particularly so if they are of the "women and children first" mindset?Actually, only youngsters will get work as no one will be able to afford to employ older workers, so youngsters will be however many tens of thousands of pounds it is better off from being in work than being out of work.Penalising the aspirational *again*. Actually, it was used up in putting the economy in shape by getting a grip on inflation so that the UK could be the fifth largest economy in the world rather than with an economy somewhere between Spain and Portugal. &gt; If you answer no to these questions then Norway has less say than us

This completely ignores soft power, the fact that within the EU the UK can be overruled by majority votes and does not have the power of veto. "What do you mean there is no hot water? You mean I have to drink this beer *cold*?"'Britain' is often used colloquially to refer to the British Isles as well as the island of Great Britain though.The implication being that austerity prevented growth. But this implication isn't just wrong, it's utterly ridiculous. Austerity restored confidence to the market which had a disproportionate effect on *increasing* growth over the medium to longer term as we are now seeing. The unsustainable model of borrowing to stimulate was fine when we have a deep well from which to borrow, but when that well is tapped out and investors lack confidence that the UK can pay it's debts that is when credit ratings are affected and growth falls over the medium to longer term. 

In short, we wouldn't be having the growth we are having now if we hadn't had austerity first. You don't need to appeal to authority to make the case, and indeed doing so is a fallacy. Nevertheless, your argument is correct and it amazes me how many people, even highly regarded economists, fail to understand that austerity was a necessary step to achieve growth and that without it the growth they now see happening that they argue austerity caused us to miss out on simply wouldn't have happened. Because "having no say" as you put it actually involves having a significant say in that your voice matters because if you don't like the result you don't have to play the game whereas "having a say" as you put it involves having no say as there are no repercussions to overruling your vote (which incidentally isn't done on occasion but [100% of the time](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu_council_voting_uk_overruled_55-32228)). &gt; UKIP has some good ideas but their economic programme is a wee bit Thatcherite

What is wrong with that?True. Assuming Corbyn steps down in 16/17 and a new leader like Umunna, Starmer, Jarvis or even the other Miliband steps in, any one of them could give the Tory front three favourites a run for their money. One should not count one's chickens before they are hatched. Landlords are profit-seeking in economic terms. Rent-seeking refers to lobbying for favourable treatment, not lobbying for equal treatment. &gt; Is not beneficial to someone in my socioeconomic class.

Thatcherism is about improving social mobility by creating greater opportunities for advancement. Like Essex boys entering the city or a grocer's daughter becoming prime minister. If you're a coal miner and prepared to adapt from unneeded skills to needed skills (e.g. plumber, electrician, builder, etc.) then the future is yours. If anything Thatcherism benefits the aspirational working classes far more than the middle or upper classes in terms of prospects, levelling the playing field and reducing barriers to prosperity.

&gt; I want nationalisation of the rail, stronger unions, less austerity more social housing built and out of the EU and Australia style points migration.

Only the immigration system is a direct UKIP policy, but only stronger unions are against UKIP policy. With those priorities why wouldn't you bite the Labour bullet and vote for Corbyn? They are for nationalisation, stronger unions and less austerity and have the same policy as UKIP on social housing with only your view on immigration being against Labour policy. 

&gt; I bite the bullet and vote for UKIP but I wish I didn't have too

The day there is a political party that perfectly represents the views of any single person is the day I'll be amazed. There is compromise in everything, after all.&gt; Council of the European Union is not the only place where we ***don't*** have influence in the EU

FTFY.

&gt; The article you link makes some good points, read them

I've read them. But I also *understand* them e.g. that most legislation not coming to a vote doesn't necessarily mean that the UK's interests are being reflected.I suppose if you ignore interest rates, void periods, damage, legislation that heavily favours the tenant, etc. then you could pretend that was True. But every industry has restrictions and every investment carries risk.Well this route penalises those who cannot buy property outright and rewards those who can, further entrenching the rich/poor divide. As such, I'd say it categorically penalises the aspirational.The day voters start voting for honest politicians is the day politicians will become honest :-(The graph shows that people make more money without union interference. By that logic unions should be banned so everyone gets a smaller slice of a bigger pie and is [better off overall in real terms](http://www.valeofinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/GDP-per-capita-Major.png).&gt; We shouldn't even be considering spending any money on nuclear deterrents till these are sorted.

I hate to be the one to break it to you but there are nasty states out there that we only have sway with because we have nuclear weapons. Us not having a nuclear deterrent merely reduces are say at the big table and let's bad people have a greater say. And that is without even getting into the changing nature of international relations meaning that we need to be prepared for all eventualities in order to provide adequate security for our people and interests.There is no tax break. There is profit and loss and landlords were taxed on the profit they made. Now, they are instead going to be taxed on revenue they generate and could easily end up being required to pay tax on a loss. Also, the risk isn't incomparably small. Interest rates were in double figures not so long ago, house prices fell in 2008 and many people faced having to sell in negative equity. Now the government is proposing making property speculation the preserve of only those able to afford to do so without requiring a mortgage, further entrenching the rich/poor divide and you say *I'm* the one smoking something?&gt; I mean, you are seeing in that link that 91% of what the UK votes on gets passed but you argue that we have no influence. It also argues that the UK prevents things from it not liking from even being voted on.

It's called "picking battles".

&gt; So the possibility of a defeat means stuff doesn't go forward, so influence is brought to bear even if it wasn't written down in a neat little statistic for you to chomp down on. 

Your example assumes that the UK is ever in that position in Europe, but due to our interests being mostly divergent from the rest of the EU (as an overall contributor) that is rarely if ever the case.

&gt; I suppose if you wanna insist we have no influence, we can get rid of our commissioner, parliamentarians, ministers and so on and end up paying the same money and taking the same migrants. I mean... apparently we are doing nothing with these people.

I didn't say we had no say, I just said we would have more say out of the EU when our saying "No" would actually mean something rather than merely being overruled. Tony Benn and perhaps a handful of others have done okay, but conviction politicians on the right aren't treated as kindly by those who disagree with them. These days you don't get anywhere without at least some spin, sadly. Even Corbyn is finding that out to his cost.No offence, but you don't seem to understand what you've written and appear to be looking at the economy in zero-sum terms when that is demonstrably not the case. The economy *has* grown in line with the 1%ers making more money. Principally because as Adam Smith rightly identifies rational actors act in their own interests. Letting the rich get rich improves the overall economy more than not doing so. The graph I provided shows that GDP per capita has risen over the same period, meaning that the poorer ALSO get better off as the 1% earn a greater share. Interesting how you conflate class and wealth... And I'm glad you had fun writing the post (Simpson's references often help with that).There can only ever be correlative proof. And it has nothing to do with debt interest.Until such time as he hands over the reins to someone in a more Blairite mould that will alienate them again...&gt; Do you not think we have something to do with current conflict?

We really don't have anything to do with the current conflict. It was there for centuries. All we did was remove a power broker who was keeping things in check, which whilst the right thing to do for moral and legal reasons despite popular belief to the contrary, left us with a power vacuum which is now being filled by other nasty people. Unless the West is prepared to be far, FAR less humanitarian in execution of it's foreign policy, this is the inevitable consequence. 

Many argue that this is the hallmark of the end of a civilisation, just as happened with the Romans, the Byzantines and the Ottomans. That may well be the case as new powers like China and India rise to prominence because you cannot have absolute authority and respect human rights fully at the same time. A democratic, humanitarian civilisation comes at a cost and as we're now seeing that cost is the likes of ISIS.The more I see of Jess Philips the less intelligent she seems, which is terribly disappointing for someone I first heard about because she told Diane Abbott to fuck off.Lisbon means that the EU doesn't require new treaties to implement binding legislation and it was one of the reasons Cameron managed to wriggle out of his previous cast-iron guarantee on a referendum. &gt; If articles haven't been written exploring the phenomenon of the middle-classes (did it again!) and their relationship to the rich and the ultra-rich and the effects it has on the wider economy, they should be. I'd read them.

Surely that's what we have these debates on reddit for?&gt; It appears that the vast majority of benefits from economic growth tend to be enjoyed by only the richest in society, and while everyone benefits from economic growth, under our current system the poorest often benefit far far less.

They do benefit far, far less from the efforts of the 1% but they DO benefit from those efforts and MORE SO than they would if the 1% weren't able to profit as they do (because if they weren't then they wouldn't have bothered making the sacrifices necessary to do so). 

In simple terms, the 1% ARE the economy. Tax the shit out of them and all of that money they generate vanishes. The best way to help the poor be better off in real terms is to let the 1% keep enough of what they make that they feel it is worthwhile them continuing to do what they do. &gt; You're welcome to speculate in property, now you're just going to have to do it without free leverage.

There was no free leverage. A BTL mortgage is a real and legitimate cost in the same way as any other loan to a business is.

&gt; Wow. How high up your ass can your head be.

I'm not sure if you are too stupid to understand or worse, are intelligent enough to understand and just believe in rewarding the rich and preventing others from improving their situation in the same way the rich are able to.

&gt; You're not taxed like a business because you aren't one.

To all intents and purposes, you are. But I suspect that this will now increasingly become a formality, albeit an unnecessary costly and bureaucratic one, as many small landlords are forced to become companies.&gt; if you want to hate her because you think she doesn't care about male suicides then you are going sound a bit crazy.

The rest of your post is good, but this line lets you down, no doubt because you aren't fully informed over the issues surrounding the idea you are discussing. It isn't that she doesn't care about male suicides, it is because she cares *less* about male suicides than female suicides. Knowing what her personal beliefs are, if women were committing suicide in greater numbers than men her track record shows that she would be campaigning for funding, legislation, resources and donations to address the issue, as she has for other issues like a lack of women in the top shadow cabinet jobs - leading to her famous "Fuck off!" to Diane Abbott.

However, as men are committing suicide at significantly greater rates to women she openly guffaws at the prospect of not even addressing this issue but of even talking about it. So you misrepresenting her opponents view of her as not caring about male suicides is actually closer to the truth than you seem to realise. Her opponents view however is not that she doesn't care AT ALL about male suicide, it is that she cares SO MUCH LESS about male suicide than she does about the number of female shadow cabinet members. The only shitpost is your response. People joke about rape for both sexes, except the jokes are only taken seriously when they are about women. Female teachers having sex with male pupils in their charge or prison rape are fair game, but Jess Philips should get a pass? Perhaps if she hadn't just literally guffawed about the prospect of not even addressing but even discussing the issue of male rape it would be possible to take your criticism seriously.Exactly. And guess what austerity prevented? You've just effectively made the argument yourself.&gt; We're mere mortals, you and I

Speak for yourself!

&gt; do you want to privatise *air*?

Could we? ;-)&gt; The money doesn't just vanish. It just gets spent in different ways, going back into the economy. 

No. It vanishes. It doesn't go back into the economy, it simply isn't made in the first place. It is lost. 

&gt; the interests of the 1% don't always align with the interests of the rest of society.

That's why we have the rule of law and regulations to prevent monopolies. But capitalism enables making use of the interests of the 1% for the betterment of everyone, providing socialists don't kill the goose that is actually laying the golden egg.

&gt; Where it does, great, let them get on with it, where it doesn't we need to regulate or have state involvement in the market. This is the foundation of a mixed economy.

A mixed economy strangles the golden goose. A free market doesn't.You are referring to [Greece](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:I9gX2Wg7zmoJ:www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2b8bf500-0f8a-11e5-94d1-00144feabdc0.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk) and the [European Central Bank](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/06/10/ecb-economists-find-that-austerity-works/)? I think it's been [tested as much as it can be](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-01-07/why-austerity-works-and-fiscal-stimulus-doesn-t).&gt; You got free leverage by having the place rented out in combination with that income being tax exempt.

That isn't income, it is revenue.

&gt; All this talk about "the rich" just makes me laugh. If they made their money meritocratically, good for them. I suspect this is some kind of a talking point straight from the property forums.

The stupid often laugh at that which they do not understand. If you want to wear that as a badge of pride, feel free. And I'll feel free to judge you for it.

&gt; On the other hand you're making more money out of exploiting a restricted market, than you are out of your productive work, which you have obtained based on your merits.

It's no different to any other business. I am really struggling to see why you can't seem to understand this.

&gt; Now this free bonanza is slowly over and you are crying over the fact that you cannot become rich for free on the backs of other more productive members of society.

It was never a free bonanza. It required the building up of initial capital, the acceptance of risk, opportunity costs, etc. When the country is crying out for more rental accommodation because rental prices are so high and you are the one championing the cause against landlords I can only suggest you take a long, hard look in the mirror because at the moment it appears you have no idea whatsoever of what you are advocating or what the consequences of it will be for those whose interests you purport to be supporting.The cost of borrowing was at historic global lows, that's why. It literally couldn't come down when the Tories took power. But the markets did improve and a depression was averted because of the restoration of confidence resulting from the belief in fiscal responsibility. Yes, it has been tested. Those states that adopted austerity showed renewed market confidence. Those that did not did not. The UK is one of those that did adopt austerity and saw the economy improve as a result. Prior to adopting austerity the economy was in recession and worsening. You're right, Etchy! Let's get rid of all the landlords and see what result that has on rental prices! ;-)I think it was more a case of he was relatively consistent but his views became recognised as being more left and batty as he aged. By prosecuting them for incitement to violence, obviously. The recession that good old George steered us out of without massively increasing inflation, interest rates or unemployment may have had something to do with that. The UK wasn't at serious risk of default under Labour but it was at risk of the cost of avoiding default becoming severe which is a major part of why they were voted out of power.Look up the debt, deficit and growth figures and see for yourself. &gt; Well we'll see if the yields go up over the next 5 years. I am almost willing to bet money on the fact that they won't.

Being that rental yields are at historic lows and this government action looks to penalise them further that may well be the case but that is unrelated to the issue in hand which is that being a landlord is running a business.

&gt; I love that you called me stupid. What do you do? I am currently at Oxford on a course with a 10% acceptance rate.

The irony! If you were intelligent you'd have demonstrated that you understood the point, not attempted to boast about your credentials, which as a student (unless you are a mature student?) are unlikely to be tempered with a great deal of real world experience. 

As for what I do, I'm intelligent enough not to provide information that could lead to my identification on an anonymous public forum. I'd recommend you do the same and delete or edit your prior comment. You can't really be this stupid? I've shown you already how it has been tested across a number of developed states including the UK in the links I've provided and I've enabled you to test it yourself by pointing out what information you need to look at yourself to do so. Are you trolling me?&gt; she was only reacting to the idea of a debate on Men\u2019s Rights in a male dominated parliament

As if those in Parliament have a track record of supporting men's rights issues!

&gt; I don't think we have any way of knowing how much more or less she cares about male suicide than female suicide. 

Her behaviour suggests otherwise.

&gt; I think what you are trying to argue is that she should have been so sobered by the mention of male suicide that all her indignation about the idea of a Men's Rights debate should have immediately abated but I don\u2019t find that very convincing.

A valiant effort from someone who clearly doesn't understand the subject, but, no, my view is that she shouldn't have laughed about the issue of male suicide and that her doing so belies her position on giving lip service to men's rights issues.

&gt; I think arguments based on caring more about one issue than another are a bid odd.

It's not about issues, it's about who those issues happen to. If you find sexism a bit odd, that's your prerogative. Personally I find it hypocritical and bigoted and I think that those that don't are bad people.Why is it that the leave camp seem perfectly prepared to acknowledge the benefits the EU has wrought but the remain camp seem to object to the very existence of better alternative options than the EU?I have always worn a poppy and never felt obligated to do so. This year is the first year I haven't due to simply lack of opportunity to obtain one but I've never felt awkward about not doing so, nor been questioned about it (although people may have made silent assumptions). I can't help but wonder how much of the feeling about being pressured to wear one stems from one's own beliefs about how persecuted they are for their stance of not wanting to wear one rather than any actual objective external pressure to do so. The Sienna Miller example Hitchens cites is a good example of this as she had one prior to airing but removed it without any apparent negative connotations at the time and only a few comments from the sorts of people that leave comments in the Daily Mail comments section after the fact. That was pretty slimy of her, attempting to get out of what she knew she'd done. It was a perfectly legitimate request to make use of International Men's Day to address issues that aren't considered at any other time in much the same way as International Women's Day is used. It's painfully clear that she is grandstanding and neither accepts that men have significant issues nor understands why those issues need a dedicated commitment to address them. I'd be embarrassed to have her as my MP.When did Connery die?How she has managed to get away with her nepotism, paedophilia support, man-hating, etc. is beyond me. Who on Earth would ever admit to voting for the definitive champagne socialist who makes Dianne Abbott look considered and consistent?No-platforming is a political tool to silence those whose arguments the NUS/Universities disagree with politically but are unable to refute. It is justified by supposedly not giving opportunity to those who espouse hatred to have their views heard, but all except those too indoctrinated into political correctness to understand what they are actually doing are aware of what is really going on. Unfortunately this is an inevitable consequence of letting those gain power who use their positions of power to silence the views of others.&gt; lol, thats bollocks.... 

Yet it happens. The ad populum fallacy straight off the bat? I expected better from you... She was objectionably in the wrong and her face saving efforts at the time and since haven't done anything except demonstrate the foolishness of continuing digging when you're in the shit.&gt; It was fairly obvious that was the reason she was laughing of the idea of men facing sexism.

Well, yes, that's kind of the point. She was laughing at the idea of men facing sexism despite the fact that men do experience sexism in the most serious ways possible ranging from suicide to academic success. This is what she was laughing at. 

&gt; I'm certain she was not laughing at the issue of male suicide

Then you are objectively wrong because this is exactly what she *was* laughing at when she was laughing at the notion of men experiencing sexism. It was an attempt to dismiss men's suffering with the notion that because there are more men than women in the Commons that men's problems can be dismissed. She even realised this herself when in her follow up she adopted the "I didn't mean it like that" approach even though it was transparent that this is exactly how she meant it and was attempting to gloss over it after the fact.

&gt; I think accusing someone who doesn't seem like a terrible person of laughing at male suicide is going to make you come across as a bit insane in my view

Hitler was a vegetarian and all that? To my mind someone who laughs at male suicide is a terrible person whether they seem so or not. We must hold differing values, even more so if you think that those criticising someone for laughing at male suicide and then attempting to cover it up come across as a bit insane in your view.

&gt; A feminist is likely to have personal experience and expertise that means she would have ideas about what she felt needed to be done to tackle an issue and affects women and be much more interested in it for that reason.

You are undoubtedly correct. Fortunately though lots of people of both sexes that identify as feminists look beyond merely women's issues and actually want to see greater equality rather than the Jess Philips types who see men as an oppressor class and women as an oppressed class and anything that gets one over on the oppressor being an intrinsic good. 

&gt; She may have very little idea about what to do about an issue that affects men.

Are you suggesting she laughed because she didn't understand what she was laughing about? You'd be correct if that was the case, although I suspect not in the manner you intended. Oh, no, they all turned him down because they all shared her view even if they didn't actively chortle at the suffering men face that causes them to commit suicide three times more often than women.Here, for example, as I've already cited.You're correct but /u/Nosferatii's point is sound and whoever has downvoted them is missing a valid argument. Whether we have high immigration or not, the population is only going to increase and we need to build upwards with better infrastructure, transport and community planning than we've had in previous decades. The 1960s tower blocks were an abject lesson in what not to do but we do need to copy the "up is better" idea and implement it more effectively. To deliver that level of sustainability we need to address the pensions ponzi as at the moment it is a time-bomb waiting to go off as soon as immigration is lowered. Whilst the Tories seem to be getting a decent grip on the economy, I have little confidence that the current incarnation of the Conservatives won't spend to win elections and let their fiscal record speak for itself and in the age of spin such a strategy would be risky at best. We're stuck between a rock and a hard place in terms of getting a grip on spending to alleviate the need for ever more taxpayers to cover the cost of pensions whilst the party remains in power long enough to deliver this when the pensioner vote is the vote that decides who gets and into stays in office.I wish you were right, Squigs, but I dont' have your faith in humanity and see it more as an arse-covering exercise than an acknowledgement that she was deeply in the wrong on the issue, or even that she is holding an unpopular opinion. I suspect she sees the situation as misogynists exercising their power against an outspoken feminist for not staying in the kitchen rather than that male suicide is a genuine problem that has gone unaddressed for far too long. After all, can you imagine her reacting anything like the same way if women were committing suicide at a rate three times that of men? Such a thing simply wouldn't have been possible for at least the past half century because of the power and influence the feminist lobby has had during that time. It says something about the NUS that they are so reactionary they prevent ideas from being debated because one side may be distressed by hearing opposing views. Even Economics Nobel Prize winners get economics badly wrong so it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if some trainee doctor who has never lived outside of a scholastic environment did too. Thatcherism's. And the data elsewhere in this thread shows that the better the 1%ers do, the better everyone else does too, so it's safe to ignore the comment as the rantings of someone who doesn't know what they are talking about.In Stoke and Crewe? Their entire rental revenue is probably less than \u00a3200,000 and their income will be well under \u00a340,000 before tax. In fact, they are probably worse off than anyone reaching the current benefit cap in real terms. HMRC always wants their pound of flesh :-(&gt; landlords have had it too easy for too long

Only someone who isn't a landlord could say something so naive!

&gt; Landlords stop being greedy, sell your housing so more buyers can get on the market!

http://e.lvme.me/pzv5j7l.jpg&gt; All too often there are bad landlords.

Because the decent one's are priced out of it by taxes? 

&gt; they dont have to do anything as a landlord just walking around during the day they get money

They have to get to that point in the first place, accept the risks of non-payment, late-payment, damages, cover void periods, deal with fluctuating interest rates, etc.

I've yet to encounter someone with anti-landlord attitudes who has the first clue about the reality of letting.I think you're being unfair on /u/northern_crusader. It is clear from the discussion that /u/AnonymousTurtle is objectively incorrect but is still attempting to wind up others with comments like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3r70ea/buytolet_tax_will_cut_our_income_by_25pc_how_much/cwlnyhk). I'm usually slow to resort to name calling myself, but wilfully misrepresenting revenue and income, outright lying about free leverage/tax breaks and being the first to resort to ad hominem's meant that a response in kind is entirely warranted. It's called "spin" and all politicians do it. You can tell by the fact their lips are moving.This sub is actually generally pretty civil and although there are abrasive posts from time to time it's borne out more by a Pat Condell-esque frustration over hypocrisy, ignorance, selfishness, etc. than any malice towards individual contributors but even with the occasional insults the level of discourse still tends to remain relatively high for the most part.That was embarrassingly unfunny. And as for the political content, where poor people have been as heavily subsidised as they have been in this country since 1997 the piper eventually needs to be paid. It's ironic that the money that was ostensibly to help improve the standard of living of the poorest is the very same money that caused their living costs to rise to the point where having the money taken away is said to have too serious an effect to be warranted. Except the economy is *based on* business performance so it is necessarily so that the 1% doing better *IS* the cause of everyone else doing better. You cannot reverse cause and effect.With a fabric band, you see her again at the end where it is clear. Weird thing to pick up on though in a video clip that is obviously about addressing physical bigotry.And consumers disposable income is based upon their confidence in markets and how steady their income is. If they are worried, they save, if they are confident they borrow but it is the 1%ers who make them confident or worried by their performance. This is very much NOT a chicken and egg argument.You beat me, I got two wrong; Quito and John Sivebaek :-(You have to understand that when the courts refer to "the best interests of the child" in legal terms this actually means "whatever the mother wants".http://i.imgur.com/esVm336.jpgIt is slightly more complex but not a lot more complex. The conditions need to be in place for the free market to operate and the 1% need to be able to keep enough of the rewards generated by their efforts to make their efforts worthwhile *for them*. Plus the effects of a globalised economy come into play. Other than that, it's them driving the economy.Luxury. I had to murder my first born with a Kellog's Cornflake when juggling 13 chainsaws whilst getting a blowjob from the guy who played Jaws in the James Bond movies just to set up my first proxy of 19, and that was the easiest one!Yes, it precisely *WAS* why she was chuckling - she was being dismissive of the notion that men have issues worth discussing, one of the principle amongst which is the suicide rate. She literally guffawed at the notion that it might be worth discussing such issues, not addressing such issues or giving resources to them but actually even discussing them. It was only when she realised what she had done that she attempted to cover her arse. Pretending that because suicide wasn't explicitly mentioned before she mocked the notion is relevant just makes you look as out of touch as she did. What did she think Davies was talking about? Male academic performance? Male health funding? Men dying seven years younger on average? Men in prison? Male victims of violence being mocked and shamed? Whatever she thought it was, whether suicide or not, she is either ignorant to the point of stupidity or callous to the point of evil. And following on from her behaviour in following this matter up I'm genuinely uncertain of which is more likely. 

EDIT: I've [just watched it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24DujnCw9mg) and that is not only why she was laughing she doubles down on it afterwards by saying it is laughable TWICE even after suicide and the other issues were raised. Perhaps she's not either evil or stupid but both?&gt; Her reasoning being that in an institution where men comprise 78% of the members, opportunity for men to raise issues that are important to them is certainly not "very limited".

You've hit the nail on the head with recognising her reasoning but for some reason don't seem to be able to understand *why* she has this reasoning. Her innate assumption is that because there are lots of men there that those men are free to raise men's issues. This betrays her ignorance and was why I was initially prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt and put her actions down to stupidity rather than malice. Men aren't at all free to talk about men's issues and get mocked for doing so just as she mocked Davies when he raised the issue, inadvertently betraying why they cannot do so freely. 

The scoff was entirely because she believed that because there were so many men in the Commons that any issues they wished to raise they were at liberty to do so whenever they wished. At the same time she argued that men's issues should not be discussed until half the Commons comprised women AND at the same time rejected the prospect of even a discussion about these issues AFTER Davies had spelt out how serious they were and what was included. So even if she was ignorant in the first instance, she certainly was not at the time she rejected giving men the same consideration as women when it comes to discussing their issues by ensuring that they have a dedicated time and resource to do so. 

So not only am I not lying as you suggest, but I've demonstrated why I am not lying and why you thinking I have done reveals that you haven't understood the machinations of what occurred. I think it's commendable that your automatic response is to attempt to think well of a person. But Philips doesn't deserve being thought well of when she knows that men's issues are not addressed in Parliament, scoffs at the notion they should be and actively prevents them from being given the opportunity to be discussed. &gt; To be fair to her she did no say that she finds the idea that men face sexism ridiculous. The only reason I suspect that she does is because in my experience, most people do and certainly most women do.

Did you mean that she DID say rather than she DID NOT say?

&gt; The claim that the reason men have higher rates of suicide is because of sexism is extremely contentious. 

That is not the claim though. The claim is not one that sexism *causes* male suicide but rather that sexism prevents male suicide from being adequately addressed, as exemplified by Philips' refusing to even allow the issue to be debated.

&gt; Saying that anyone who laughs at the idea of men experiencing sexism is also laughing at men's suicide is absurd.

It isn't absurd, it is True. They just don't always realise what they are doing.

&gt; Dismissing the idea that men are the victims of sexism is not the same as dismissing men's suffering.

Well, actually it is. But that is beside the point as Philips went on to dismiss male suffering as something not worth discussing after Davies had listed many examples of men's suffering not being addressed.

&gt; Sorry but you haven't convinced me that she laughing at male suicide so the rest of your post is complete bollocks.

You not understanding what she is doing is no different to her not understanding what she's doing, but it doesn't change the fact that she is doing it. &gt; She did not say it. She only talked about House of Commons being male dominated.

She said it was "laughable" that there wasn't opportunity to discuss these issues, completely ignoring that regardless of the Commons being male dominated, men's issues are socially unacceptable to raise and are ignored or ridiculed (as she herself demonstrated).

&gt; Except she didn't refuse to allow the issue to be debated.

That is *exactly* what she did. Saying that she'd be happy to do so but denying the motion to debate the issues on International Men's Day. 

&gt; No she didn't. She explicitly said she would be happy to discuss male suicide.

Only AFTER she had laughed at the notion AND called it laughable but been called out for doing so and was attempting to cover her arse.&gt; Well that is going a bit overboard

I wish you were right, Hoffi, but unfortunately you're not :-(

&gt; It is not that people are scared of somehow being proven wrong

You're obviously not familiar with the safe spaces that get set up whenever any students with politically correct beliefs run the risk of having those beliefs challenged. Don't you remember the brouhaha about safe spaces with puppy rooms? That wasn't a pastiche, that was a real thing!

&gt; it is the knee jerk reaction in a lot of student politics - just "ban" things that they disagree with

Well, yes, but the reason they want to ban things they disagree with is *because* they cannot win the arguments against such things.

The rest of your post I pretty much agree with. Do people really not understand his views or are they just being flippant? 

The argument against gay marriage is predominantly that it is a religious ceremony for the purpose of bringing together one man and one woman for the purposes of creating a stable family within which to bring up children and the state should not interfere with that. Instead, the state can offer a civil equivalent whereby the same tax breaks, adoption rules and divorce legislation applies to any two named persons so that homosexuals (or heterosexuals who don't end up married but do want to take advantage of the same rules and laws that apply to married persons) are not discriminated against. 

I'm an atheist and I understand this view without any difficulty. It let's both the religious types and those who aren't able to get married have the same protections and rights under law without infringing upon anyone's religious beliefs. If marriage is a religious institution the brings together a man and a woman in holy matrimony, then calling something marriage that brings together two men or two women in holy matrimony does infringe upon the religious rights of other people and calling it something else but granting the same legal rights to it seems a better compromise than deliberately trouncing the beliefs of those who see marriage as religious.I'm not sure why you think it would have more weight if the state did currently discriminate against gay people for fostering and adoption - could you elucidate?It isn't hypocritical because the tax cuts are designed to encourage growth. Increasing taxes has the opposite effect. I don't think this relates to the Laffer Curve as we are talking about growth rather than optimal tax yields in this instance. Optimal tax yields on the Laffer Curve at any given moment will be at a significantly higher rate of tax than the rate for ongoing optimal growth, meaning that over time regardless of where the Laffer Curve is in relation to current tax rates it is always to the left of longer-term tax rates.I think even most of the electorate understand that balancing the books doesn't mean having a zero deficit, it just means managing the economy so that growth is stable. It's hardly a cover when they are open about it and it is popular with the electorate to shrink the state. The Tories were voted in specifically to get the economy in order and this entails cutting spending.You're not even trying any more, are you?Some did. Similar with some Catholics and divorce. And with your latter two sentences you are making my point for me.Indeed, but what balancing the books actually means to most people in terms of the national economy is sustainable growth.Still don't get what you mean :-(Considering that the definition *IS* their definition, yes it does, hence the call for civil unions.She isn't facing threats of rape. A couple of commentors at vote made some nasty comments about a politician. Worse happens here about everyone from Cameron to Corbyn.&gt; The worst she's done is scoff at a chancer. Whats your obsession with her?

No obsession, a lot of people just strongly dislike hypocrites that bask in their ignorance and leave others to suffer as a result. Think of it the same way you think about Osborne and the tax credit cuts, except with no medium to longer term benefits for those suffering.

&gt; Why are you wasting so much time trying to smear her?

No one is smearing her, but it is entirely fair to highlight what she is actually saying and doing without the spin. She may not be as much of a man-hater as Harriet Harman but the results of her actions are the same.

&gt; Is it because its an easy story for your blog?

Next time please provide a direct link the blog rather than force me to have to type the URL manually! Saved for later review though, thanks! ;-)

&gt; How does trying to whip up online hate for this woman help men's rights?

Highlighting what she has said and done draws attention to how readily men's issues are not just dismissed but actively prevented from being even talked about. This is the first time that the attempted shaming appears to have backfired on the person doing it and as such is actually a pretty big deal.It's not what *I* think, it's what religious folks think. And in the form it has been practised in for millennia it is a religious ceremony and has been for long before the concept of nation states ruling on such things has existed. Those are issues with the practice, not the theory. And according to religious types, the child rearing aspects of marriage are very much not entirely optional (go forth and multiply).&gt; There is apathy towards men's issues but it is not socially unacceptable to raise them.

Says the guy defending the woman who guffawed at someone for raising them. Clearly it *is* socially unacceptable to raise them because raising them gets one guffawed at. 

&gt; Being opposed to having a specific debate which she believed was being framed in the context of men's rights isn't the same as being opposed to debating issues that affect men in general. 

Wrong again. Rewatch the clip. She literally argues that men's rights don't need addressing, followed by there are plenty of opportunities to address them, followed by International Men's Day is not an acceptable event to warrant debate of men's issues, followed by instead such a debate could occur at some other, unspecified time i.e. never.

&gt; That is only your interpretation. Now she clarified what she said. You have no reason not to accept her clarification.

It isn't *only* my interpretation, it is an objectively accurate assessment of what occurred based on decades of experience of dealing with such perspectives. 

&gt; The fact you don't suggest you have a very strange view of feminists. Why would anyone be opposed to having a debate about men's suicide? It's one of the most uncontentious issues imaginable.

I'm not sure if you are asking out of naivete or trolling? Feminists have been opposed to discussing men's issues for decades because they divert resources away from female causes, highlight that the feminist narrative about women experiencing greater sexual discrimination than men is so far the opposite of reality that admitting it would cause cognitive dissonance so extreme it would render adherents insane to realise how much they are the bad guys and there really are man-haters within the feminist movement who want to see men suffer. Atheists who adhere to the religious precept. It very much IS a religious institution and has been for thousands of years. More recently it has become a legal institution too, but this is a very recent phenomenon and some people still do see the civil aspects as significantly less important to them than the religious elements. Taking this institution that people believe is holy and deliberately saying to them that they can no longer determine what it is, is fundamentally offensive and morally unjustifiable where it caused and causes no harm and equivalent alternatives are available without subjugating the original meaning. It isn't that it has no effect on their marriages, of course it doesn't, but it does directly insult their beliefs. 

Now I am all for equal rights (and equal lefts for those that deserve them too), but marriage is a religious ceremony. As an atheist, I would not care about getting married in a church, synagogue or mosque, but I understand that others hold differing views and I respect that difference *being that they are the ones who hold the institution of holy matrimony sacred*. Personally, I feel the Flying Spaghetti Monster is just as likely as their beliefs but that is not the issue. The issue is that it matters a great deal to them and they have been the protectors and promoters of the institution to the point that it has become so normalised in society and it is wrong to then say to them "Thanks for that, now we're going to change the meaning of this sacred thing of yours and if you complain about it you can be arrested and gaoled". 

Sucking a penis constitutes enthusiastic consent. It requires capacity and agency. Unless you're talking the kind of stuff that goes on in the Facial Abuse videos, but it would be entirely misrepresentative to call that "sucking". So what you're saying is the consent she gave was reluctant?Consent can be withdrawn *at any time* and many argue that it can be given conditionally and hence withdrawn retrospectively. Certainly this is what happens in practice. Without meaning to get all Ched Evans, explicit and enthusiastic consent maintained throughout and given at a time when the alleged victim is deemed compos mentis to consent to one party but not another has been shown to be insufficient to keep an innocent man out of prison.&gt; I thought you were asserting that most rape accusations are regrets not genuine rape

[Wouldn't surprise me at all.](http://boysmeneducation.com/avfms-mega-post-10-reasons-False-rape-accusations-are-common/) Putting Santa on Christmas cards or Rabbits on Easter doesn't contradict what Christians say Christmas or Easter is. 

&gt; I have no issue at all with people saying they don't want gay marriages in their church

But other people do. 

&gt; they can fuck right off if they think they own the whole concept of marriage. 

They don't think they own the whole concept, they just believe that when it is called "marriage" it is a religious ceremony between a man and a woman with the purpose of creating a stable environment for procreation and bringing up children. Call it a civil union and grant all the same rights under law and everyone should be happy.

&gt; I'm a bit surprised that you think religious people should be allowed to push their ideology in a secular society. 

You're right in that it seems counter-intuitive for someone with my ideology, but the fact is that marriage is a religious concept and has been since long before Christianity was the dominant religion on these isles. The fact that it has been co-opted by the state is all well and good, but I think it is wrong for the state to then say after having co-opted it that the original definition is no longer acceptable under law. Compliance is not the same as enthusiastic consent though and giving a blow job requires enthusiastic consent.

And a kiss on the cheek to someone sleeping as you leave their bed to head back to yours after a night of passion should not constitute sexual assault either and it is ridiculous that a wife would be as guilty of sexual assault for kissing her sleeping husband as someone would be for groping a drunken stranger too incapacitated to consent. Besides which, physical contact is an important part of non verbal communication and this utterly ridiculously poorly thought out (or perhaps intentionally poorly thought out?) law criminalises everything from a footballer patting a team mate on the buttock to a first kiss that isn't explicitly requested (and in doing so potentially destroying the prospect). The law is an ass.

But most importantly if there is no coercion, enthusiastic consent is demonstrated and penetration occurs it is not rape, even under this completely sexist and unrealistically stupid law.&gt; you have condoned rape

No I have not. I have disagreed with you about what constitutes rape. You of all people I would expect to be VERY clear on the difference.&gt; How is it not a problem for the theory that it is built upon erroneous premises? 

What erroneous premises? Marriage has been the religiously sanctified union of a man and a woman for the purposes of creating a stable environment for procreation and child rearing for time immemorial. 

&gt; Really? So can you cite for me the Anglican, Catholic... rules which bar infertile people and fertile people who don't want children from marrying?

This argument should be beneath you and it certainly makes me reluctant to take you seriously. Don't pretend to be stupid. You know full well that the reference is to the purpose of marriage, not the guaranteed outcome.

&gt; There is no mention of marriage in Genesis 9 

I'll take your word for it, I'm not going to bother to check. It was just an example.&gt; I find it rather difficult to believe that opportunities to bring up mens issues in such a male-dominated environment are "limited"

Really? I know you're a lefty but even you must have noticed the absence of prior debates on any issues negatively affecting men in Parliament? The reasons for this are principally twofold; on the one hand, the vast majority of both sexes care very little about male suffering and on the other hand the vast majority of both sexes care very deeply about female suffering.&gt; Nothing is stopping them from being raised

That simply isn't True. There is a massive stigma attached to men acknowledging weakness and vulnerability. You don't have to look at how Jess Philips behaved towards Philip Davies when he raised the issue to understand that.There is a severe social stigma and when people do attempt to raise the issue, like Davies has, others use this as an opportunity to have a pop at them rather than address the issue. Saying that Philips wanted a motion is completely misrepresenting what happened. She prevented a debate at the most opportune and appropriate juncture, International Men's Day, and instead suggested another occurence with an as yet unspecified and to be decided time i.e. never.If you think it is reasonable to compare the behaviour of an elected MP in their formal capacity with a couple of mouthy teenagers on an anonymous internet forum, then you have a point.&gt; The problem is that 'Men's Rights' is ~~dominated by~~ *represented by feminists and the media as* arsehole anti-feminists over people who actually want to see men's rights realised.

FTFY.

&gt; That sub organised a flood of False rape reports to Occidental college. Not exactly the furtherance of men's rights.

I'm not sure if you are a moron or zealot, but either way you completely misrepresent what happened. Occidental adopted a policy which in practice meant that any accusation, no matter how frivolous, should be sufficient to warrant expulsion without requirement for any proof. Activists RIGHTLY demonstrated the stupidity of such a policy by demonstrating that anyone could make a False accusation, making the point extremely effectively that the policy was not only unjust but literally insane. 

&gt; /r/menslib is a great sub, in contrast, that discusses real issues in a sensible and constructive way. 

Menslib is a feminist sub that has literally nothing to do with improving men's situations. It doesn't discuss real issues at all, let alone in a sensible or constructive way. It is a bunch of male feminists whining about how they inadvertently oppress women by their existence and comes across as a parody to any objective observer. Heer, heer!They aren't whining about women, they are whining about gender feminists, those very same gender feminists that you dismiss in this thread as blaming everything on the Patriarchy. This finished disappointingly but I'm glad I could upvote so many of your posts. Some good points and well made. You are, Etchy. Not sure why you are being downvoted as you've been stonking for the most part in this thread and not just because I agree with your position, you're elucidating things extremely clearly and succinctly to the point that those engaging with you aren't able to refute you. It's great to read.Except that problems that mostly affect women have already been dealt with pretty much because people care about women, whereas men's problems have been getting worse because no one cares about men's suffering.They do, they believe that gay men should be able to marry any woman who agrees to it!&gt; you need to understand that in order to achieve equal rights you do not focus on the section of society that has the most power in society

YOU need to understand that in order to achieve equal rights you DO need to focus on those sections of society that don't have power, whether overt or soft, and that includes all of those groups that don't have special protections and privileges both socially and under law. 

&gt; We do not focus on abled, cis, white, heterosexual rights because they are the majority, they do not experience inequality and they have the power.

This is the **single stupidest thing I have ever read on reddit** (and I've browsed SRS). Do you think that able-bodied, cis, white, heterosexual men all experience the same privilege? They are first out the door when it comes time for redundancies, last to be considered when organisations want to demonstrate their diversity credentials, have none of the legal protections of their opposite group identities in practice, are virtually the only group that is acceptable to demonise because of their group characteristics, etc.

But returning to the male/female dichotomy, there is virtually no meaningful area in the UK where women are not significantly privileged over men (unless you count the presumption of knowledge by garage mechanics and the expectation of paying for dates) yet feminists still pretend that women have it worse off and men's rights and issues are dismissed as a joke because the apex fallacy shows that there are more men in Parliament than women. Well those men in Parliament don't give a flying fuck about men, they have the same outgroup bias towards women as women have ingroup bias towards women. 

&gt; Do you think it's unfair that there isn't Heterosexual pride for instance?

I had a drink thrown at me for kissing a girl in public. The glass broke on my shoulder and fortunately neither she nor I were injured but a broken glass can do a lot of damage. Had I had been doing the same with a guy it would have been treated as a hate crime and taken a lot more seriously. &gt; you have to remember that men still hold the majority power in society, such as the House of Commons

No they don't. Men are in those positions of power because they appeal to women voters, who represent the largest block of voters and who have the *real* power. Power belongs to those on whose behalf it is wielded, not the one who does the wielding. 
&gt; Even if we give her every available shred of the benefit of the doubt we can possibly scrape together and pretend what she describes is exactly how it happened... If her response in committee had been to say, "The honourable member for Shipley has a track record for supporting egregious and appalling ideas and for repeatedly abusing parliamentary process to derail discussions he doesn't like. It concerns me that his interest is not straight-forward and his concern is not genuinely for the generally well-being of men."

&gt; That would have flown.

Agreed. It's good that left and right can come agree on some things. &gt; I just can't think of any examples of systematic misandry.

The family courts and child custody, divorce law generally, child support, the draft, "women and children first", "women don't belong in prison!", views on shorter male life expectancy, suicide, incarceration, male victims of IPV &amp; rape, workplace fatalities, male performance in academia and these are just the examples that occur off the top of my head.

&gt; all claims to systematic misandry are actually the result of historical and sysyematic misogyny

This is the "Patriarchy hurts men too" fallacy. These systematic misandrist discriminatory occurrences don't stem from patriarchal misogyny, they stem from [male outgroup bias towards women](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurie_Rudman/publication/8226295_Gender_differences_in_automatic_in-group_bias_why_do_women_like_women_more_than_men_like_men/links/0a85e5324b69af209e000000.pdf).

&gt; While I do understand why you're receiving the down votes you are, you definitely don't deserve them

Some comments have genuinely contributed to the discussion, others, like the "Misandry doesn't exist" one above do not."Misogyny doesn't exist"

/sure you can figure it out for yourself.&gt; The idea that there are feminists trying to stop people talking about issues like male suicide is quite insane. 

[I'm honestly no longer sure if you're stupid or a liar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARHCxAMAO0)

&gt; I agree.

Whilst I'm delighted to hear that, your assumptions about who has power and who does not in our society are so far removed from who actually has power and who does not, that you still think that men cannot be victims of inequality which is beyond absurd. 

&gt; Not the exact same, but to the similar degree, yes.

So you think that David Cameron and a white, able, cis, heterosexual male on a sink estate on Teeside have the same privileges? What privileges do you think those are?

&gt; Do you think hate crime exists against heterosexual couples?

A better question to ask would be why should hate crimes be treated any differently from other crimes when the victim suffers exactly the same regardless of the motives of the offender.https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/3gck1f/this_sub_isnt_going_to_work_if_people_keep/

[Male feminists are hilarious.](http://kareningalasmith.com/2013/12/16/thanks-and-all-but-no-thanks-i-dont-want-men-in-my-feminism/)I hope your grammar about the "could of/have" was better there? If you think reddit has grammar Nazis, TakiMag puts us to shame!I know, I've read your posts in this thread and agree with you, I'm just highlighting the one thing that stood out from that post that needed addressing.&gt; No, it doesn't. There's a reason the definition of rape specifically includes oral penetration.

There is also a reason the definition of rape excludes envelopment/being made to penetrate. But there is a difference between enthusiastic blow jobs and oral rape, as exemplified by my reference to the gagging type porn vid's earlier. 

&gt; The law is not on your side.

Tell me about it! As a man, I'm more likely to be found guilty, given a longer sentence and be hauled up in the first place. But that doesn't make it right. 

&gt; The circumstances and a reasonable belief in consent are taken into account.

No they aren't, although that might be how things should be in theory. In practice however the opposite is True as a conviction is sought and doubt is cast on the reasonable belief in consent as we discussed in our previous exploration of the Ched Evans case in the discussion we got into last month. 

&gt; I find the accusation of sexism amusing

You find the fact that men cannot be raped by women under English Common Law by engaging in sex with them without consent (unless they penetrate the man) amusing? 

&gt; Noone is forcing people to rape.

Other than those changing the definitions of rape to include where consent is informed, meaningful and enthusiastically given throughout, you mean?

&gt; They break the law of their own free will, and should suffer the requisite punishment.

So you agree with me that if there is no mens rea then they haven't committed rape?Marriage being a legal ceremony under the auspices of the nation state is a relatively recent thing, although there have been legal connotations to the religious ceremony for thousands of years. In fact, it is precisely because there have been legal connotations to the sacred vows made in the religious ceremony that the state took a formal interest in marriage and the led to the situation we now have today where it has in effect been appropriated by the state and the bodies responsible for giving it the status it has non-consensually divorced from it. Ironic, really, that at the same time this has happened the actual divorce rate has exploded. In this thread I have stated that enthusiastic consent in delivering a blow job can be differentiated from merely having a penis in one's mouth and not removing it so far as consent is concerned. I understood from your engagement thus far that you accepted enthusiastic consent as a barometer of actual consent being given?

&gt; If we define condoning as to accept/permit morally deficient behaviour, albeit tacitly or with reluctance, then you have condoned rape as far as the law is concerned. 

If we define rabbits as grapefruit, breakfast becomes far more interesting but it doesn't make rabbits grapefruit. Morally deficient behaviour that is within the parameters of the law is not condoning rape. Pointing out that the goalposts of the law are in the wrong position for ensuring justice is delivered is not condoning rape either. 

&gt; You may disagree with the law. But dissent is not a legal defense.

Were I ever to be charged with rape I will remember these wise words when up in front of the judge ;-)&gt; And millions of people don't believe it's a religious ceremony. 

I don't believe it is a religious ceremony but I understand that others do and see no need to cause them unnecessary distress by redefining their definition of marriage in law when perfectly adequate alternatives in the form of civil unions were an option. 

&gt; Do you think atheists should be allowed to be married?

Only if they are not poor ;-)

&gt; Fine, if the state says everyone has to have a civil partnership, and if religious people then want to go off and have whatever ceremony they want, that's cool. Remove the state entirely from marriage. No tax breaks &amp;c &amp;c from a marriage, only from a legal, state recognised civil partnership. 

Well, that was relatively easy to get agreement on! If only all reddit debates were like this!&gt; Child courts favour women because of a pre-conceived notion of what women should be (mothers) rather than any pre-conceived notion towards men.

You can always tell those who haven't done their research by seeing if they attempt this counter-argument. Children of divorce used to go to the father before WWI. Do you know why? Do you know why it changed in between the wars? It has literally nothing to do with the pre-conceived notion that women should be mothers. That's feminist bullshit to propagate the idea of patriarchy, but it's entirely unTrue. They've been lying to you and you bought it. Allow me to quote [Karen Straughan](http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/when-female-privilege-backfires-2/) to explain:

&gt; When men received automatic custody after divorce, it was because they were solely obligated to support the children. When early feminists pushed through the TYD, that obligation did not shift onto women\u2013mothers got custody, but fathers were still required to provide material support. Incidentally, once this doctrine was in place, the divorce rate, which had been a constant for centuries, increased 15-fold in just 50 years. Huh.

Huh, indeed. The whole "systematic sexism against women" screed that feminists have been trying to make mainstream for the past 40 or 50 years begins to unravel when looked at closely. The arguments don't hold water and even taking into account feminist theory can still be shown to be wrong, even when feminists dismiss objective proof as patriarchal. 

&gt; I don't know enough about the other examples you provided to comment, which I admit to. Maybe OP can comment here, as I feel she shares my POV here. 

I respect your honesty so won't make any digs other than to say that perhaps you might consider that there is an entire other side to the narrative you have been presented with and accepted that shows it up for the conspiracy theory it is and that by doing your own research into both sides of the debate you can remove the wool that has been pulled over your eyes and see that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes after all.Well, you know what they say...

Because marriage has *meaning* and *purpose* to them and anyone wanting to do so needs to adhere to the meaning and purpose or it diminishes what they see as sacred. 

&gt; I just don't think marriage IS a religious thing.

Well, obviously it isn't a religious thing to most people, but being that most non-religious people who get married do so for the same reasons and purpose espoused by those who take the religious aspects of marriage very seriously this isn't a problem.

&gt; I have no problem with religious people having their marriage be as much about god as they want.

But to them it is the institution of marriage that matters, not just their own marriages (indeed many may not be married). 

&gt; THEY (or, a minority of them, anyway) are the ones with the problem with other people getting married. 

They have no problem with other people getting married, they have a problem with other people usurping what they see as the meaning and purpose of marriage to turn something they see as holy into something profane. You don't have to agree with this to understand it which is why I am having such a hard time believing you don't get this.

&gt; They can define marriage as however religious as they want. The state, on the other hand, doesn't. 

Then why can't the state enact civil unions for hetero and homo couples and let the churches provide marriage ceremonies that remain a religious event and keep everyone happy?Interesting spin you put on the threads. It would be more accurate to describe them thus:

* It is unacceptable to criticise feminism
* Masculinity is bad
* Men's rights activists are bad
* Men shouldn't be able to take criticism in the same way that feminists cannot
* Women deserve reproductive options that men do not

If you were being honest, of course. And then we have:

&gt; Then we finish with an article by a fringe writer who doesn't want men talking about women's issues. 

These views aren't fringe, aren't rare and aren't nice:

I'm really sorry that the world isn't how you think it should be. If it makes you feel any better it isn't how anyone else thinks it should be either, me included. But it is how it is, not how you seem to see it. That's something that you'll either have to deal with or live with the cognitive dissonance the rest of your life and for someone capable of engaging in debate about an issue they clearly feel strongly about without resorting to downvoting those who disagree with them, as you have not downvoted me, that won't be a pleasant way to go through life. David Miliband, Chuka Umunna and Dan Jarvis appear to be the frontrunners at the moment, but it is still early days yet.This thread is useless without pics (feels like FARK saying that here).[Pwns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk)?No, negging is a backhanded compliment, like "Not everyone would have the confidence to wear that", he was attempting to be cocky/funny in the mould of more conventional PUA without apparently succeeding but an emoticon and a sufficiently attractive profile could have made all the difference to how his message was interpreted. It's funny because on the one hand you accuse people who believe that marriage is holy matrimony of bigotry without realising that doing so is displaying that very same bigotry you are accusing them of! And it has nothing to do with religious freedom and everything to do with profaning what religious people see as sacred. That's why the state should provide civil unions under law for both heterosexuals and homosexuals and leave the holy side of things to the churches.&gt; Yes. It has meaning and purpose to me too. It has meaning and purpose to gay couples who want to get married, too. 

It might have meaning and purpose for [others](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2356774/Australian-woman-Jodi-Rose-marries-bridge-France--gets-mayors-blessing.html) too, but if the differing meanings and purposes conflict with the one responsible for the institution's societal importance in the first place and the problem can be resolved without profaning what the religious see as sacred by adopting civil unions for the state and leaving marriage as the religious side of things then everyone can come away happy instead of deliberately and unnecessarily distressing people who cling to their religious beliefs. 

&gt; Most gay couples who get married do so for the exact same reasons.

I see someone hasn't explained to you what homosexuality entails when it comes to producing children. Not to worry, you can ask your mummy and daddy about it when you get older ;-)

&gt; The only ones trying to restrict it here are those religious people (and a few non-religious) who think THEIR definition of marriage has to be the LEGAL definition, despite the majority of people disagreeing with them.

They don't think their definition is the legal one, they think that their definition is the one ordained by God and is therefore sacred. Call me a softy, but I just don't see the need to deliberately upset such people when civil unions can easily be made available to couples of all sexualities.

&gt; Tough shit, frankly. There are plenty of people who think drinking on the Sabath is bad, but that's their problem, not mine.

You haven't been drinking on the Sabbath, have you, Eggy? You're everlasting soul will spend eternity in damnation! ;-) Seriously though, it's like Muslim's getting upset about images of Mohamed. It's one thing to say people should be free to draw Mohamed without fearing reprisals but it's another thing entirely to call Muslims bigots for getting upset at people for doing something they see as distressing. 

&gt; Do you think we should stop eating beef because Hindus think they are holy animals? 

This is ironically actually a closer example to having gay marriage banned rather than being forced to accept it. 

&gt; I'm fairly certain that if the state decided to stop recognising marriages as "official", legal events, that there would be outrage.

The state already does this. Didn't you know? A wedding ceremony without legal registration doesn't count in the UK.Isn't the point that they don't care? Doesn't that make the stuff about women making up 50% of MP's pointless and redundant? If the so-called oppressors don't actually oppress and do actually represent the diversity of their constituent's interests, that makes what Philips said idiotic. &gt; if they cared about these issues they could bring them up in any debate.

Could they? I doubt it. Men's issues are widely ridiculed and promoting them at the expense of the opportunity to promote women's issues would be a quick way to lose your seat. 

&gt; They don't. So demonstrably men don't have issues.

This is as ridiculous as saying women didn't have issues before the suffrage movement.&gt; Women aren't selected as candidates/elected by people as often are men.

They are *selected* MORE. They don't stand as often because the costs of doing so are too high. 

In terms of access, woman have *far greater* access to Parliament as MPs but elect not to take advantage of their greater access because of the sacrifices required to do so in relation to the benefits it yields. Actually, women outnumber men in the UK and vote more than men, so they are above 50% on both counts. &gt; The fact there is a stark contrast shows that there likely glass ceilings etc. 

No it doesn't. The sacrifices necessary to become an MP are significant and female candidates are given preference at every stage of the process so that parties can demonstrate their gender diversity. Women aren't stupid though and recognise the massive commitment and costs associated with becoming a career politician and after weighing up the pros and cons few elect to pursue it. That is NOT evidence of discrimination though. Evidence of discrimination is women only shortlists. A statistical differentiation could be for a multitude of reasons, none of which are discrimination.People do vote for their local MP based on their party leader though so even if they don't directly vote for PM that may well be their intent.From Valerie Solinas to Bahar Mustafa. Didn't realise they'd introduced all-male shortlists. Can you provide a link?But that's Diane's *whole identity*!Marlon Brando. He's widely considered one of the greats and has had some good roles (Streetcar, Waterfront, Godfather, etc.) but the roles made him great rather than how he filled them. I think Apocalypse Now, Superman and The Apaloosa most accurately reflect his limited range, and films like Don Juan DeMarco, Last Tango in Paris and Mutiny on the Bounty reveal his shortcomings as an actual actor when offered potential range.Perhaps you genuinely aren't aware of this, but men [didn't have representation before suffrage](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11509811/Why-has-everyone-forgotten-about-male-suffrage.html). Also, you completely missed the point which was that just because a group doesn't raise issues doesn't mean the group doesn't have issues. What difference does it make if those in Parliament are not acting in the interests of their fellow man? Particularly so if they are of the "women and children first" mindset?Actually, only youngsters will get work as no one will be able to afford to employ older workers, so youngsters will be however many tens of thousands of pounds it is better off from being in work than being out of work.Penalising the aspirational *again*. Actually, it was used up in putting the economy in shape by getting a grip on inflation so that the UK could be the fifth largest economy in the world rather than with an economy somewhere between Spain and Portugal. &gt; If you answer no to these questions then Norway has less say than us

This completely ignores soft power, the fact that within the EU the UK can be overruled by majority votes and does not have the power of veto. "What do you mean there is no hot water? You mean I have to drink this beer *cold*?"'Britain' is often used colloquially to refer to the British Isles as well as the island of Great Britain though.The implication being that austerity prevented growth. But this implication isn't just wrong, it's utterly ridiculous. Austerity restored confidence to the market which had a disproportionate effect on *increasing* growth over the medium to longer term as we are now seeing. The unsustainable model of borrowing to stimulate was fine when we have a deep well from which to borrow, but when that well is tapped out and investors lack confidence that the UK can pay it's debts that is when credit ratings are affected and growth falls over the medium to longer term. 

In short, we wouldn't be having the growth we are having now if we hadn't had austerity first. You don't need to appeal to authority to make the case, and indeed doing so is a fallacy. Nevertheless, your argument is correct and it amazes me how many people, even highly regarded economists, fail to understand that austerity was a necessary step to achieve growth and that without it the growth they now see happening that they argue austerity caused us to miss out on simply wouldn't have happened. Because "having no say" as you put it actually involves having a significant say in that your voice matters because if you don't like the result you don't have to play the game whereas "having a say" as you put it involves having no say as there are no repercussions to overruling your vote (which incidentally isn't done on occasion but [100% of the time](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu_council_voting_uk_overruled_55-32228)). &gt; UKIP has some good ideas but their economic programme is a wee bit Thatcherite

What is wrong with that?True. Assuming Corbyn steps down in 16/17 and a new leader like Umunna, Starmer, Jarvis or even the other Miliband steps in, any one of them could give the Tory front three favourites a run for their money. One should not count one's chickens before they are hatched. Landlords are profit-seeking in economic terms. Rent-seeking refers to lobbying for favourable treatment, not lobbying for equal treatment. &gt; Is not beneficial to someone in my socioeconomic class.

Thatcherism is about improving social mobility by creating greater opportunities for advancement. Like Essex boys entering the city or a grocer's daughter becoming prime minister. If you're a coal miner and prepared to adapt from unneeded skills to needed skills (e.g. plumber, electrician, builder, etc.) then the future is yours. If anything Thatcherism benefits the aspirational working classes far more than the middle or upper classes in terms of prospects, levelling the playing field and reducing barriers to prosperity.

&gt; I want nationalisation of the rail, stronger unions, less austerity more social housing built and out of the EU and Australia style points migration.

Only the immigration system is a direct UKIP policy, but only stronger unions are against UKIP policy. With those priorities why wouldn't you bite the Labour bullet and vote for Corbyn? They are for nationalisation, stronger unions and less austerity and have the same policy as UKIP on social housing with only your view on immigration being against Labour policy. 

&gt; I bite the bullet and vote for UKIP but I wish I didn't have too

The day there is a political party that perfectly represents the views of any single person is the day I'll be amazed. There is compromise in everything, after all.&gt; Council of the European Union is not the only place where we ***don't*** have influence in the EU

FTFY.

&gt; The article you link makes some good points, read them

I've read them. But I also *understand* them e.g. that most legislation not coming to a vote doesn't necessarily mean that the UK's interests are being reflected.I suppose if you ignore interest rates, void periods, damage, legislation that heavily favours the tenant, etc. then you could pretend that was True. But every industry has restrictions and every investment carries risk.Well this route penalises those who cannot buy property outright and rewards those who can, further entrenching the rich/poor divide. As such, I'd say it categorically penalises the aspirational.The day voters start voting for honest politicians is the day politicians will become honest :-(The graph shows that people make more money without union interference. By that logic unions should be banned so everyone gets a smaller slice of a bigger pie and is [better off overall in real terms](http://www.valeofinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/GDP-per-capita-Major.png).&gt; We shouldn't even be considering spending any money on nuclear deterrents till these are sorted.

I hate to be the one to break it to you but there are nasty states out there that we only have sway with because we have nuclear weapons. Us not having a nuclear deterrent merely reduces are say at the big table and let's bad people have a greater say. And that is without even getting into the changing nature of international relations meaning that we need to be prepared for all eventualities in order to provide adequate security for our people and interests.There is no tax break. There is profit and loss and landlords were taxed on the profit they made. Now, they are instead going to be taxed on revenue they generate and could easily end up being required to pay tax on a loss. Also, the risk isn't incomparably small. Interest rates were in double figures not so long ago, house prices fell in 2008 and many people faced having to sell in negative equity. Now the government is proposing making property speculation the preserve of only those able to afford to do so without requiring a mortgage, further entrenching the rich/poor divide and you say *I'm* the one smoking something?&gt; I mean, you are seeing in that link that 91% of what the UK votes on gets passed but you argue that we have no influence. It also argues that the UK prevents things from it not liking from even being voted on.

It's called "picking battles".

&gt; So the possibility of a defeat means stuff doesn't go forward, so influence is brought to bear even if it wasn't written down in a neat little statistic for you to chomp down on. 

Your example assumes that the UK is ever in that position in Europe, but due to our interests being mostly divergent from the rest of the EU (as an overall contributor) that is rarely if ever the case.

&gt; I suppose if you wanna insist we have no influence, we can get rid of our commissioner, parliamentarians, ministers and so on and end up paying the same money and taking the same migrants. I mean... apparently we are doing nothing with these people.

I didn't say we had no say, I just said we would have more say out of the EU when our saying "No" would actually mean something rather than merely being overruled. Tony Benn and perhaps a handful of others have done okay, but conviction politicians on the right aren't treated as kindly by those who disagree with them. These days you don't get anywhere without at least some spin, sadly. Even Corbyn is finding that out to his cost.No offence, but you don't seem to understand what you've written and appear to be looking at the economy in zero-sum terms when that is demonstrably not the case. The economy *has* grown in line with the 1%ers making more money. Principally because as Adam Smith rightly identifies rational actors act in their own interests. Letting the rich get rich improves the overall economy more than not doing so. The graph I provided shows that GDP per capita has risen over the same period, meaning that the poorer ALSO get better off as the 1% earn a greater share. Interesting how you conflate class and wealth... And I'm glad you had fun writing the post (Simpson's references often help with that).There can only ever be correlative proof. And it has nothing to do with debt interest.Until such time as he hands over the reins to someone in a more Blairite mould that will alienate them again...&gt; Do you not think we have something to do with current conflict?

We really don't have anything to do with the current conflict. It was there for centuries. All we did was remove a power broker who was keeping things in check, which whilst the right thing to do for moral and legal reasons despite popular belief to the contrary, left us with a power vacuum which is now being filled by other nasty people. Unless the West is prepared to be far, FAR less humanitarian in execution of it's foreign policy, this is the inevitable consequence. 

Many argue that this is the hallmark of the end of a civilisation, just as happened with the Romans, the Byzantines and the Ottomans. That may well be the case as new powers like China and India rise to prominence because you cannot have absolute authority and respect human rights fully at the same time. A democratic, humanitarian civilisation comes at a cost and as we're now seeing that cost is the likes of ISIS.The more I see of Jess Philips the less intelligent she seems, which is terribly disappointing for someone I first heard about because she told Diane Abbott to fuck off.Lisbon means that the EU doesn't require new treaties to implement binding legislation and it was one of the reasons Cameron managed to wriggle out of his previous cast-iron guarantee on a referendum. &gt; If articles haven't been written exploring the phenomenon of the middle-classes (did it again!) and their relationship to the rich and the ultra-rich and the effects it has on the wider economy, they should be. I'd read them.

Surely that's what we have these debates on reddit for?&gt; It appears that the vast majority of benefits from economic growth tend to be enjoyed by only the richest in society, and while everyone benefits from economic growth, under our current system the poorest often benefit far far less.

They do benefit far, far less from the efforts of the 1% but they DO benefit from those efforts and MORE SO than they would if the 1% weren't able to profit as they do (because if they weren't then they wouldn't have bothered making the sacrifices necessary to do so). 

In simple terms, the 1% ARE the economy. Tax the shit out of them and all of that money they generate vanishes. The best way to help the poor be better off in real terms is to let the 1% keep enough of what they make that they feel it is worthwhile them continuing to do what they do. &gt; You're welcome to speculate in property, now you're just going to have to do it without free leverage.

There was no free leverage. A BTL mortgage is a real and legitimate cost in the same way as any other loan to a business is.

&gt; Wow. How high up your ass can your head be.

I'm not sure if you are too stupid to understand or worse, are intelligent enough to understand and just believe in rewarding the rich and preventing others from improving their situation in the same way the rich are able to.

&gt; You're not taxed like a business because you aren't one.

To all intents and purposes, you are. But I suspect that this will now increasingly become a formality, albeit an unnecessary costly and bureaucratic one, as many small landlords are forced to become companies.&gt; if you want to hate her because you think she doesn't care about male suicides then you are going sound a bit crazy.

The rest of your post is good, but this line lets you down, no doubt because you aren't fully informed over the issues surrounding the idea you are discussing. It isn't that she doesn't care about male suicides, it is because she cares *less* about male suicides than female suicides. Knowing what her personal beliefs are, if women were committing suicide in greater numbers than men her track record shows that she would be campaigning for funding, legislation, resources and donations to address the issue, as she has for other issues like a lack of women in the top shadow cabinet jobs - leading to her famous "Fuck off!" to Diane Abbott.

However, as men are committing suicide at significantly greater rates to women she openly guffaws at the prospect of not even addressing this issue but of even talking about it. So you misrepresenting her opponents view of her as not caring about male suicides is actually closer to the truth than you seem to realise. Her opponents view however is not that she doesn't care AT ALL about male suicide, it is that she cares SO MUCH LESS about male suicide than she does about the number of female shadow cabinet members. The only shitpost is your response. People joke about rape for both sexes, except the jokes are only taken seriously when they are about women. Female teachers having sex with male pupils in their charge or prison rape are fair game, but Jess Philips should get a pass? Perhaps if she hadn't just literally guffawed about the prospect of not even addressing but even discussing the issue of male rape it would be possible to take your criticism seriously.Exactly. And guess what austerity prevented? You've just effectively made the argument yourself.&gt; We're mere mortals, you and I

Speak for yourself!

&gt; do you want to privatise *air*?

Could we? ;-)&gt; The money doesn't just vanish. It just gets spent in different ways, going back into the economy. 

No. It vanishes. It doesn't go back into the economy, it simply isn't made in the first place. It is lost. 

&gt; the interests of the 1% don't always align with the interests of the rest of society.

That's why we have the rule of law and regulations to prevent monopolies. But capitalism enables making use of the interests of the 1% for the betterment of everyone, providing socialists don't kill the goose that is actually laying the golden egg.

&gt; Where it does, great, let them get on with it, where it doesn't we need to regulate or have state involvement in the market. This is the foundation of a mixed economy.

A mixed economy strangles the golden goose. A free market doesn't.You are referring to [Greece](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:I9gX2Wg7zmoJ:www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2b8bf500-0f8a-11e5-94d1-00144feabdc0.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk) and the [European Central Bank](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/06/10/ecb-economists-find-that-austerity-works/)? I think it's been [tested as much as it can be](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-01-07/why-austerity-works-and-fiscal-stimulus-doesn-t).&gt; You got free leverage by having the place rented out in combination with that income being tax exempt.

That isn't income, it is revenue.

&gt; All this talk about "the rich" just makes me laugh. If they made their money meritocratically, good for them. I suspect this is some kind of a talking point straight from the property forums.

The stupid often laugh at that which they do not understand. If you want to wear that as a badge of pride, feel free. And I'll feel free to judge you for it.

&gt; On the other hand you're making more money out of exploiting a restricted market, than you are out of your productive work, which you have obtained based on your merits.

It's no different to any other business. I am really struggling to see why you can't seem to understand this.

&gt; Now this free bonanza is slowly over and you are crying over the fact that you cannot become rich for free on the backs of other more productive members of society.

It was never a free bonanza. It required the building up of initial capital, the acceptance of risk, opportunity costs, etc. When the country is crying out for more rental accommodation because rental prices are so high and you are the one championing the cause against landlords I can only suggest you take a long, hard look in the mirror because at the moment it appears you have no idea whatsoever of what you are advocating or what the consequences of it will be for those whose interests you purport to be supporting.The cost of borrowing was at historic global lows, that's why. It literally couldn't come down when the Tories took power. But the markets did improve and a depression was averted because of the restoration of confidence resulting from the belief in fiscal responsibility. Yes, it has been tested. Those states that adopted austerity showed renewed market confidence. Those that did not did not. The UK is one of those that did adopt austerity and saw the economy improve as a result. Prior to adopting austerity the economy was in recession and worsening. You're right, Etchy! Let's get rid of all the landlords and see what result that has on rental prices! ;-)I think it was more a case of he was relatively consistent but his views became recognised as being more left and batty as he aged. By prosecuting them for incitement to violence, obviously. The recession that good old George steered us out of without massively increasing inflation, interest rates or unemployment may have had something to do with that. The UK wasn't at serious risk of default under Labour but it was at risk of the cost of avoiding default becoming severe which is a major part of why they were voted out of power.Look up the debt, deficit and growth figures and see for yourself. &gt; Well we'll see if the yields go up over the next 5 years. I am almost willing to bet money on the fact that they won't.

Being that rental yields are at historic lows and this government action looks to penalise them further that may well be the case but that is unrelated to the issue in hand which is that being a landlord is running a business.

&gt; I love that you called me stupid. What do you do? I am currently at Oxford on a course with a 10% acceptance rate.

The irony! If you were intelligent you'd have demonstrated that you understood the point, not attempted to boast about your credentials, which as a student (unless you are a mature student?) are unlikely to be tempered with a great deal of real world experience. 

As for what I do, I'm intelligent enough not to provide information that could lead to my identification on an anonymous public forum. I'd recommend you do the same and delete or edit your prior comment. You can't really be this stupid? I've shown you already how it has been tested across a number of developed states including the UK in the links I've provided and I've enabled you to test it yourself by pointing out what information you need to look at yourself to do so. Are you trolling me?&gt; she was only reacting to the idea of a debate on Men\u2019s Rights in a male dominated parliament

As if those in Parliament have a track record of supporting men's rights issues!

&gt; I don't think we have any way of knowing how much more or less she cares about male suicide than female suicide. 

Her behaviour suggests otherwise.

&gt; I think what you are trying to argue is that she should have been so sobered by the mention of male suicide that all her indignation about the idea of a Men's Rights debate should have immediately abated but I don\u2019t find that very convincing.

A valiant effort from someone who clearly doesn't understand the subject, but, no, my view is that she shouldn't have laughed about the issue of male suicide and that her doing so belies her position on giving lip service to men's rights issues.

&gt; I think arguments based on caring more about one issue than another are a bid odd.

It's not about issues, it's about who those issues happen to. If you find sexism a bit odd, that's your prerogative. Personally I find it hypocritical and bigoted and I think that those that don't are bad people.Why is it that the leave camp seem perfectly prepared to acknowledge the benefits the EU has wrought but the remain camp seem to object to the very existence of better alternative options than the EU?I have always worn a poppy and never felt obligated to do so. This year is the first year I haven't due to simply lack of opportunity to obtain one but I've never felt awkward about not doing so, nor been questioned about it (although people may have made silent assumptions). I can't help but wonder how much of the feeling about being pressured to wear one stems from one's own beliefs about how persecuted they are for their stance of not wanting to wear one rather than any actual objective external pressure to do so. The Sienna Miller example Hitchens cites is a good example of this as she had one prior to airing but removed it without any apparent negative connotations at the time and only a few comments from the sorts of people that leave comments in the Daily Mail comments section after the fact. That was pretty slimy of her, attempting to get out of what she knew she'd done. It was a perfectly legitimate request to make use of International Men's Day to address issues that aren't considered at any other time in much the same way as International Women's Day is used. It's painfully clear that she is grandstanding and neither accepts that men have significant issues nor understands why those issues need a dedicated commitment to address them. I'd be embarrassed to have her as my MP.When did Connery die?How she has managed to get away with her nepotism, paedophilia support, man-hating, etc. is beyond me. Who on Earth would ever admit to voting for the definitive champagne socialist who makes Dianne Abbott look considered and consistent?No-platforming is a political tool to silence those whose arguments the NUS/Universities disagree with politically but are unable to refute. It is justified by supposedly not giving opportunity to those who espouse hatred to have their views heard, but all except those too indoctrinated into political correctness to understand what they are actually doing are aware of what is really going on. Unfortunately this is an inevitable consequence of letting those gain power who use their positions of power to silence the views of others.&gt; lol, thats bollocks.... 

Yet it happens. The ad populum fallacy straight off the bat? I expected better from you... She was objectionably in the wrong and her face saving efforts at the time and since haven't done anything except demonstrate the foolishness of continuing digging when you're in the shit.&gt; It was fairly obvious that was the reason she was laughing of the idea of men facing sexism.

Well, yes, that's kind of the point. She was laughing at the idea of men facing sexism despite the fact that men do experience sexism in the most serious ways possible ranging from suicide to academic success. This is what she was laughing at. 

&gt; I'm certain she was not laughing at the issue of male suicide

Then you are objectively wrong because this is exactly what she *was* laughing at when she was laughing at the notion of men experiencing sexism. It was an attempt to dismiss men's suffering with the notion that because there are more men than women in the Commons that men's problems can be dismissed. She even realised this herself when in her follow up she adopted the "I didn't mean it like that" approach even though it was transparent that this is exactly how she meant it and was attempting to gloss over it after the fact.

&gt; I think accusing someone who doesn't seem like a terrible person of laughing at male suicide is going to make you come across as a bit insane in my view

Hitler was a vegetarian and all that? To my mind someone who laughs at male suicide is a terrible person whether they seem so or not. We must hold differing values, even more so if you think that those criticising someone for laughing at male suicide and then attempting to cover it up come across as a bit insane in your view.

&gt; A feminist is likely to have personal experience and expertise that means she would have ideas about what she felt needed to be done to tackle an issue and affects women and be much more interested in it for that reason.

You are undoubtedly correct. Fortunately though lots of people of both sexes that identify as feminists look beyond merely women's issues and actually want to see greater equality rather than the Jess Philips types who see men as an oppressor class and women as an oppressed class and anything that gets one over on the oppressor being an intrinsic good. 

&gt; She may have very little idea about what to do about an issue that affects men.

Are you suggesting she laughed because she didn't understand what she was laughing about? You'd be correct if that was the case, although I suspect not in the manner you intended. Oh, no, they all turned him down because they all shared her view even if they didn't actively chortle at the suffering men face that causes them to commit suicide three times more often than women.Here, for example, as I've already cited.You're correct but /u/Nosferatii's point is sound and whoever has downvoted them is missing a valid argument. Whether we have high immigration or not, the population is only going to increase and we need to build upwards with better infrastructure, transport and community planning than we've had in previous decades. The 1960s tower blocks were an abject lesson in what not to do but we do need to copy the "up is better" idea and implement it more effectively. To deliver that level of sustainability we need to address the pensions ponzi as at the moment it is a time-bomb waiting to go off as soon as immigration is lowered. Whilst the Tories seem to be getting a decent grip on the economy, I have little confidence that the current incarnation of the Conservatives won't spend to win elections and let their fiscal record speak for itself and in the age of spin such a strategy would be risky at best. We're stuck between a rock and a hard place in terms of getting a grip on spending to alleviate the need for ever more taxpayers to cover the cost of pensions whilst the party remains in power long enough to deliver this when the pensioner vote is the vote that decides who gets and into stays in office.I wish you were right, Squigs, but I dont' have your faith in humanity and see it more as an arse-covering exercise than an acknowledgement that she was deeply in the wrong on the issue, or even that she is holding an unpopular opinion. I suspect she sees the situation as misogynists exercising their power against an outspoken feminist for not staying in the kitchen rather than that male suicide is a genuine problem that has gone unaddressed for far too long. After all, can you imagine her reacting anything like the same way if women were committing suicide at a rate three times that of men? Such a thing simply wouldn't have been possible for at least the past half century because of the power and influence the feminist lobby has had during that time. It says something about the NUS that they are so reactionary they prevent ideas from being debated because one side may be distressed by hearing opposing views. Even Economics Nobel Prize winners get economics badly wrong so it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if some trainee doctor who has never lived outside of a scholastic environment did too. Thatcherism's. And the data elsewhere in this thread shows that the better the 1%ers do, the better everyone else does too, so it's safe to ignore the comment as the rantings of someone who doesn't know what they are talking about.In Stoke and Crewe? Their entire rental revenue is probably less than \u00a3200,000 and their income will be well under \u00a340,000 before tax. In fact, they are probably worse off than anyone reaching the current benefit cap in real terms. HMRC always wants their pound of flesh :-(&gt; landlords have had it too easy for too long

Only someone who isn't a landlord could say something so naive!

&gt; Landlords stop being greedy, sell your housing so more buyers can get on the market!

http://e.lvme.me/pzv5j7l.jpg&gt; All too often there are bad landlords.

Because the decent one's are priced out of it by taxes? 

&gt; they dont have to do anything as a landlord just walking around during the day they get money

They have to get to that point in the first place, accept the risks of non-payment, late-payment, damages, cover void periods, deal with fluctuating interest rates, etc.

I've yet to encounter someone with anti-landlord attitudes who has the first clue about the reality of letting.I think you're being unfair on /u/northern_crusader. It is clear from the discussion that /u/AnonymousTurtle is objectively incorrect but is still attempting to wind up others with comments like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/3r70ea/buytolet_tax_will_cut_our_income_by_25pc_how_much/cwlnyhk). I'm usually slow to resort to name calling myself, but wilfully misrepresenting revenue and income, outright lying about free leverage/tax breaks and being the first to resort to ad hominem's meant that a response in kind is entirely warranted. It's called "spin" and all politicians do it. You can tell by the fact their lips are moving.This sub is actually generally pretty civil and although there are abrasive posts from time to time it's borne out more by a Pat Condell-esque frustration over hypocrisy, ignorance, selfishness, etc. than any malice towards individual contributors but even with the occasional insults the level of discourse still tends to remain relatively high for the most part.That was embarrassingly unfunny. And as for the political content, where poor people have been as heavily subsidised as they have been in this country since 1997 the piper eventually needs to be paid. It's ironic that the money that was ostensibly to help improve the standard of living of the poorest is the very same money that caused their living costs to rise to the point where having the money taken away is said to have too serious an effect to be warranted. Except the economy is *based on* business performance so it is necessarily so that the 1% doing better *IS* the cause of everyone else doing better. You cannot reverse cause and effect.With a fabric band, you see her again at the end where it is clear. Weird thing to pick up on though in a video clip that is obviously about addressing physical bigotry.And consumers disposable income is based upon their confidence in markets and how steady their income is. If they are worried, they save, if they are confident they borrow but it is the 1%ers who make them confident or worried by their performance. This is very much NOT a chicken and egg argument.You beat me, I got two wrong; Quito and John Sivebaek :-(You have to understand that when the courts refer to "the best interests of the child" in legal terms this actually means "whatever the mother wants".http://i.imgur.com/esVm336.jpgIt is slightly more complex but not a lot more complex. The conditions need to be in place for the free market to operate and the 1% need to be able to keep enough of the rewards generated by their efforts to make their efforts worthwhile *for them*. Plus the effects of a globalised economy come into play. Other than that, it's them driving the economy.Luxury. I had to murder my first born with a Kellog's Cornflake when juggling 13 chainsaws whilst getting a blowjob from the guy who played Jaws in the James Bond movies just to set up my first proxy of 19, and that was the easiest one!Yes, it precisely *WAS* why she was chuckling - she was being dismissive of the notion that men have issues worth discussing, one of the principle amongst which is the suicide rate. She literally guffawed at the notion that it might be worth discussing such issues, not addressing such issues or giving resources to them but actually even discussing them. It was only when she realised what she had done that she attempted to cover her arse. Pretending that because suicide wasn't explicitly mentioned before she mocked the notion is relevant just makes you look as out of touch as she did. What did she think Davies was talking about? Male academic performance? Male health funding? Men dying seven years younger on average? Men in prison? Male victims of violence being mocked and shamed? Whatever she thought it was, whether suicide or not, she is either ignorant to the point of stupidity or callous to the point of evil. And following on from her behaviour in following this matter up I'm genuinely uncertain of which is more likely. 

EDIT: I've [just watched it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24DujnCw9mg) and that is not only why she was laughing she doubles down on it afterwards by saying it is laughable TWICE even after suicide and the other issues were raised. Perhaps she's not either evil or stupid but both?&gt; Her reasoning being that in an institution where men comprise 78% of the members, opportunity for men to raise issues that are important to them is certainly not "very limited".

You've hit the nail on the head with recognising her reasoning but for some reason don't seem to be able to understand *why* she has this reasoning. Her innate assumption is that because there are lots of men there that those men are free to raise men's issues. This betrays her ignorance and was why I was initially prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt and put her actions down to stupidity rather than malice. Men aren't at all free to talk about men's issues and get mocked for doing so just as she mocked Davies when he raised the issue, inadvertently betraying why they cannot do so freely. 

The scoff was entirely because she believed that because there were so many men in the Commons that any issues they wished to raise they were at liberty to do so whenever they wished. At the same time she argued that men's issues should not be discussed until half the Commons comprised women AND at the same time rejected the prospect of even a discussion about these issues AFTER Davies had spelt out how serious they were and what was included. So even if she was ignorant in the first instance, she certainly was not at the time she rejected giving men the same consideration as women when it comes to discussing their issues by ensuring that they have a dedicated time and resource to do so. 

So not only am I not lying as you suggest, but I've demonstrated why I am not lying and why you thinking I have done reveals that you haven't understood the machinations of what occurred. I think it's commendable that your automatic response is to attempt to think well of a person. But Philips doesn't deserve being thought well of when she knows that men's issues are not addressed in Parliament, scoffs at the notion they should be and actively prevents them from being given the opportunity to be discussed. &gt; To be fair to her she did no say that she finds the idea that men face sexism ridiculous. The only reason I suspect that she does is because in my experience, most people do and certainly most women do.

Did you mean that she DID say rather than she DID NOT say?

&gt; The claim that the reason men have higher rates of suicide is because of sexism is extremely contentious. 

That is not the claim though. The claim is not one that sexism *causes* male suicide but rather that sexism prevents male suicide from being adequately addressed, as exemplified by Philips' refusing to even allow the issue to be debated.

&gt; Saying that anyone who laughs at the idea of men experiencing sexism is also laughing at men's suicide is absurd.

It isn't absurd, it is True. They just don't always realise what they are doing.

&gt; Dismissing the idea that men are the victims of sexism is not the same as dismissing men's suffering.

Well, actually it is. But that is beside the point as Philips went on to dismiss male suffering as something not worth discussing after Davies had listed many examples of men's suffering not being addressed.

&gt; Sorry but you haven't convinced me that she laughing at male suicide so the rest of your post is complete bollocks.

You not understanding what she is doing is no different to her not understanding what she's doing, but it doesn't change the fact that she is doing it. &gt; She did not say it. She only talked about House of Commons being male dominated.

She said it was "laughable" that there wasn't opportunity to discuss these issues, completely ignoring that regardless of the Commons being male dominated, men's issues are socially unacceptable to raise and are ignored or ridiculed (as she herself demonstrated).

&gt; Except she didn't refuse to allow the issue to be debated.

That is *exactly* what she did. Saying that she'd be happy to do so but denying the motion to debate the issues on International Men's Day. 

&gt; No she didn't. She explicitly said she would be happy to discuss male suicide.

Only AFTER she had laughed at the notion AND called it laughable but been called out for doing so and was attempting to cover her arse.&gt; Well that is going a bit overboard

I wish you were right, Hoffi, but unfortunately you're not :-(

&gt; It is not that people are scared of somehow being proven wrong

You're obviously not familiar with the safe spaces that get set up whenever any students with politically correct beliefs run the risk of having those beliefs challenged. Don't you remember the brouhaha about safe spaces with puppy rooms? That wasn't a pastiche, that was a real thing!

&gt; it is the knee jerk reaction in a lot of student politics - just "ban" things that they disagree with

Well, yes, but the reason they want to ban things they disagree with is *because* they cannot win the arguments against such things.

The rest of your post I pretty much agree with. Do people really not understand his views or are they just being flippant? 

The argument against gay marriage is predominantly that it is a religious ceremony for the purpose of bringing together one man and one woman for the purposes of creating a stable family within which to bring up children and the state should not interfere with that. Instead, the state can offer a civil equivalent whereby the same tax breaks, adoption rules and divorce legislation applies to any two named persons so that homosexuals (or heterosexuals who don't end up married but do want to take advantage of the same rules and laws that apply to married persons) are not discriminated against. 

I'm an atheist and I understand this view without any difficulty. It let's both the religious types and those who aren't able to get married have the same protections and rights under law without infringing upon anyone's religious beliefs. If marriage is a religious institution the brings together a man and a woman in holy matrimony, then calling something marriage that brings together two men or two women in holy matrimony does infringe upon the religious rights of other people and calling it something else but granting the same legal rights to it seems a better compromise than deliberately trouncing the beliefs of those who see marriage as religious.I'm not sure why you think it would have more weight if the state did currently discriminate against gay people for fostering and adoption - could you elucidate?It isn't hypocritical because the tax cuts are designed to encourage growth. Increasing taxes has the opposite effect. I don't think this relates to the Laffer Curve as we are talking about growth rather than optimal tax yields in this instance. Optimal tax yields on the Laffer Curve at any given moment will be at a significantly higher rate of tax than the rate for ongoing optimal growth, meaning that over time regardless of where the Laffer Curve is in relation to current tax rates it is always to the left of longer-term tax rates.I think even most of the electorate understand that balancing the books doesn't mean having a zero deficit, it just means managing the economy so that growth is stable. It's hardly a cover when they are open about it and it is popular with the electorate to shrink the state. The Tories were voted in specifically to get the economy in order and this entails cutting spending.You're not even trying any more, are you?Some did. Similar with some Catholics and divorce. And with your latter two sentences you are making my point for me.Indeed, but what balancing the books actually means to most people in terms of the national economy is sustainable growth.Still don't get what you mean :-(Considering that the definition *IS* their definition, yes it does, hence the call for civil unions.She isn't facing threats of rape. A couple of commentors at vote made some nasty comments about a politician. Worse happens here about everyone from Cameron to Corbyn.&gt; The worst she's done is scoff at a chancer. Whats your obsession with her?

No obsession, a lot of people just strongly dislike hypocrites that bask in their ignorance and leave others to suffer as a result. Think of it the same way you think about Osborne and the tax credit cuts, except with no medium to longer term benefits for those suffering.

&gt; Why are you wasting so much time trying to smear her?

No one is smearing her, but it is entirely fair to highlight what she is actually saying and doing without the spin. She may not be as much of a man-hater as Harriet Harman but the results of her actions are the same.

&gt; Is it because its an easy story for your blog?

Next time please provide a direct link the blog rather than force me to have to type the URL manually! Saved for later review though, thanks! ;-)

&gt; How does trying to whip up online hate for this woman help men's rights?

Highlighting what she has said and done draws attention to how readily men's issues are not just dismissed but actively prevented from being even talked about. This is the first time that the attempted shaming appears to have backfired on the person doing it and as such is actually a pretty big deal.It's not what *I* think, it's what religious folks think. And in the form it has been practised in for millennia it is a religious ceremony and has been for long before the concept of nation states ruling on such things has existed. Those are issues with the practice, not the theory. And according to religious types, the child rearing aspects of marriage are very much not entirely optional (go forth and multiply).&gt; There is apathy towards men's issues but it is not socially unacceptable to raise them.

Says the guy defending the woman who guffawed at someone for raising them. Clearly it *is* socially unacceptable to raise them because raising them gets one guffawed at. 

&gt; Being opposed to having a specific debate which she believed was being framed in the context of men's rights isn't the same as being opposed to debating issues that affect men in general. 

Wrong again. Rewatch the clip. She literally argues that men's rights don't need addressing, followed by there are plenty of opportunities to address them, followed by International Men's Day is not an acceptable event to warrant debate of men's issues, followed by instead such a debate could occur at some other, unspecified time i.e. never.

&gt; That is only your interpretation. Now she clarified what she said. You have no reason not to accept her clarification.

It isn't *only* my interpretation, it is an objectively accurate assessment of what occurred based on decades of experience of dealing with such perspectives. 

&gt; The fact you don't suggest you have a very strange view of feminists. Why would anyone be opposed to having a debate about men's suicide? It's one of the most uncontentious issues imaginable.

I'm not sure if you are asking out of naivete or trolling? Feminists have been opposed to discussing men's issues for decades because they divert resources away from female causes, highlight that the feminist narrative about women experiencing greater sexual discrimination than men is so far the opposite of reality that admitting it would cause cognitive dissonance so extreme it would render adherents insane to realise how much they are the bad guys and there really are man-haters within the feminist movement who want to see men suffer. Atheists who adhere to the religious precept. It very much IS a religious institution and has been for thousands of years. More recently it has become a legal institution too, but this is a very recent phenomenon and some people still do see the civil aspects as significantly less important to them than the religious elements. Taking this institution that people believe is holy and deliberately saying to them that they can no longer determine what it is, is fundamentally offensive and morally unjustifiable where it caused and causes no harm and equivalent alternatives are available without subjugating the original meaning. It isn't that it has no effect on their marriages, of course it doesn't, but it does directly insult their beliefs. 

Now I am all for equal rights (and equal lefts for those that deserve them too), but marriage is a religious ceremony. As an atheist, I would not care about getting married in a church, synagogue or mosque, but I understand that others hold differing views and I respect that difference *being that they are the ones who hold the institution of holy matrimony sacred*. Personally, I feel the Flying Spaghetti Monster is just as likely as their beliefs but that is not the issue. The issue is that it matters a great deal to them and they have been the protectors and promoters of the institution to the point that it has become so normalised in society and it is wrong to then say to them "Thanks for that, now we're going to change the meaning of this sacred thing of yours and if you complain about it you can be arrested and gaoled". 

Sucking a penis constitutes enthusiastic consent. It requires capacity and agency. Unless you're talking the kind of stuff that goes on in the Facial Abuse videos, but it would be entirely misrepresentative to call that "sucking". So what you're saying is the consent she gave was reluctant?Consent can be withdrawn *at any time* and many argue that it can be given conditionally and hence withdrawn retrospectively. Certainly this is what happens in practice. Without meaning to get all Ched Evans, explicit and enthusiastic consent maintained throughout and given at a time when the alleged victim is deemed compos mentis to consent to one party but not another has been shown to be insufficient to keep an innocent man out of prison.&gt; I thought you were asserting that most rape accusations are regrets not genuine rape

[Wouldn't surprise me at all.](http://boysmeneducation.com/avfms-mega-post-10-reasons-False-rape-accusations-are-common/) Putting Santa on Christmas cards or Rabbits on Easter doesn't contradict what Christians say Christmas or Easter is. 

&gt; I have no issue at all with people saying they don't want gay marriages in their church

But other people do. 

&gt; they can fuck right off if they think they own the whole concept of marriage. 

They don't think they own the whole concept, they just believe that when it is called "marriage" it is a religious ceremony between a man and a woman with the purpose of creating a stable environment for procreation and bringing up children. Call it a civil union and grant all the same rights under law and everyone should be happy.

&gt; I'm a bit surprised that you think religious people should be allowed to push their ideology in a secular society. 

You're right in that it seems counter-intuitive for someone with my ideology, but the fact is that marriage is a religious concept and has been since long before Christianity was the dominant religion on these isles. The fact that it has been co-opted by the state is all well and good, but I think it is wrong for the state to then say after having co-opted it that the original definition is no longer acceptable under law. Compliance is not the same as enthusiastic consent though and giving a blow job requires enthusiastic consent.

And a kiss on the cheek to someone sleeping as you leave their bed to head back to yours after a night of passion should not constitute sexual assault either and it is ridiculous that a wife would be as guilty of sexual assault for kissing her sleeping husband as someone would be for groping a drunken stranger too incapacitated to consent. Besides which, physical contact is an important part of non verbal communication and this utterly ridiculously poorly thought out (or perhaps intentionally poorly thought out?) law criminalises everything from a footballer patting a team mate on the buttock to a first kiss that isn't explicitly requested (and in doing so potentially destroying the prospect). The law is an ass.

But most importantly if there is no coercion, enthusiastic consent is demonstrated and penetration occurs it is not rape, even under this completely sexist and unrealistically stupid law.&gt; you have condoned rape

No I have not. I have disagreed with you about what constitutes rape. You of all people I would expect to be VERY clear on the difference.&gt; How is it not a problem for the theory that it is built upon erroneous premises? 

What erroneous premises? Marriage has been the religiously sanctified union of a man and a woman for the purposes of creating a stable environment for procreation and child rearing for time immemorial. 

&gt; Really? So can you cite for me the Anglican, Catholic... rules which bar infertile people and fertile people who don't want children from marrying?

This argument should be beneath you and it certainly makes me reluctant to take you seriously. Don't pretend to be stupid. You know full well that the reference is to the purpose of marriage, not the guaranteed outcome.

&gt; There is no mention of marriage in Genesis 9 

I'll take your word for it, I'm not going to bother to check. It was just an example.&gt; I find it rather difficult to believe that opportunities to bring up mens issues in such a male-dominated environment are "limited"

Really? I know you're a lefty but even you must have noticed the absence of prior debates on any issues negatively affecting men in Parliament? The reasons for this are principally twofold; on the one hand, the vast majority of both sexes care very little about male suffering and on the other hand the vast majority of both sexes care very deeply about female suffering.&gt; Nothing is stopping them from being raised

That simply isn't True. There is a massive stigma attached to men acknowledging weakness and vulnerability. You don't have to look at how Jess Philips behaved towards Philip Davies when he raised the issue to understand that.There is a severe social stigma and when people do attempt to raise the issue, like Davies has, others use this as an opportunity to have a pop at them rather than address the issue. Saying that Philips wanted a motion is completely misrepresenting what happened. She prevented a debate at the most opportune and appropriate juncture, International Men's Day, and instead suggested another occurence with an as yet unspecified and to be decided time i.e. never.If you think it is reasonable to compare the behaviour of an elected MP in their formal capacity with a couple of mouthy teenagers on an anonymous internet forum, then you have a point.&gt; The problem is that 'Men's Rights' is ~~dominated by~~ *represented by feminists and the media as* arsehole anti-feminists over people who actually want to see men's rights realised.

FTFY.

&gt; That sub organised a flood of False rape reports to Occidental college. Not exactly the furtherance of men's rights.

I'm not sure if you are a moron or zealot, but either way you completely misrepresent what happened. Occidental adopted a policy which in practice meant that any accusation, no matter how frivolous, should be sufficient to warrant expulsion without requirement for any proof. Activists RIGHTLY demonstrated the stupidity of such a policy by demonstrating that anyone could make a False accusation, making the point extremely effectively that the policy was not only unjust but literally insane. 

&gt; /r/menslib is a great sub, in contrast, that discusses real issues in a sensible and constructive way. 

Menslib is a feminist sub that has literally nothing to do with improving men's situations. It doesn't discuss real issues at all, let alone in a sensible or constructive way. It is a bunch of male feminists whining about how they inadvertently oppress women by their existence and comes across as a parody to any objective observer. Heer, heer!They aren't whining about women, they are whining about gender feminists, those very same gender feminists that you dismiss in this thread as blaming everything on the Patriarchy. This finished disappointingly but I'm glad I could upvote so many of your posts. Some good points and well made. You are, Etchy. Not sure why you are being downvoted as you've been stonking for the most part in this thread and not just because I agree with your position, you're elucidating things extremely clearly and succinctly to the point that those engaging with you aren't able to refute you. It's great to read.Except that problems that mostly affect women have already been dealt with pretty much because people care about women, whereas men's problems have been getting worse because no one cares about men's suffering.They do, they believe that gay men should be able to marry any woman who agrees to it!&gt; you need to understand that in order to achieve equal rights you do not focus on the section of society that has the most power in society

YOU need to understand that in order to achieve equal rights you DO need to focus on those sections of society that don't have power, whether overt or soft, and that includes all of those groups that don't have special protections and privileges both socially and under law. 

&gt; We do not focus on abled, cis, white, heterosexual rights because they are the majority, they do not experience inequality and they have the power.

This is the **single stupidest thing I have ever read on reddit** (and I've browsed SRS). Do you think that able-bodied, cis, white, heterosexual men all experience the same privilege? They are first out the door when it comes time for redundancies, last to be considered when organisations want to demonstrate their diversity credentials, have none of the legal protections of their opposite group identities in practice, are virtually the only group that is acceptable to demonise because of their group characteristics, etc.

But returning to the male/female dichotomy, there is virtually no meaningful area in the UK where women are not significantly privileged over men (unless you count the presumption of knowledge by garage mechanics and the expectation of paying for dates) yet feminists still pretend that women have it worse off and men's rights and issues are dismissed as a joke because the apex fallacy shows that there are more men in Parliament than women. Well those men in Parliament don't give a flying fuck about men, they have the same outgroup bias towards women as women have ingroup bias towards women. 

&gt; Do you think it's unfair that there isn't Heterosexual pride for instance?

I had a drink thrown at me for kissing a girl in public. The glass broke on my shoulder and fortunately neither she nor I were injured but a broken glass can do a lot of damage. Had I had been doing the same with a guy it would have been treated as a hate crime and taken a lot more seriously. &gt; you have to remember that men still hold the majority power in society, such as the House of Commons

No they don't. Men are in those positions of power because they appeal to women voters, who represent the largest block of voters and who have the *real* power. Power belongs to those on whose behalf it is wielded, not the one who does the wielding. 
&gt; Even if we give her every available shred of the benefit of the doubt we can possibly scrape together and pretend what she describes is exactly how it happened... If her response in committee had been to say, "The honourable member for Shipley has a track record for supporting egregious and appalling ideas and for repeatedly abusing parliamentary process to derail discussions he doesn't like. It concerns me that his interest is not straight-forward and his concern is not genuinely for the generally well-being of men."

&gt; That would have flown.

Agreed. It's good that left and right can come agree on some things. &gt; I just can't think of any examples of systematic misandry.

The family courts and child custody, divorce law generally, child support, the draft, "women and children first", "women don't belong in prison!", views on shorter male life expectancy, suicide, incarceration, male victims of IPV &amp; rape, workplace fatalities, male performance in academia and these are just the examples that occur off the top of my head.

&gt; all claims to systematic misandry are actually the result of historical and sysyematic misogyny

This is the "Patriarchy hurts men too" fallacy. These systematic misandrist discriminatory occurrences don't stem from patriarchal misogyny, they stem from [male outgroup bias towards women](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurie_Rudman/publication/8226295_Gender_differences_in_automatic_in-group_bias_why_do_women_like_women_more_than_men_like_men/links/0a85e5324b69af209e000000.pdf).

&gt; While I do understand why you're receiving the down votes you are, you definitely don't deserve them

Some comments have genuinely contributed to the discussion, others, like the "Misandry doesn't exist" one above do not."Misogyny doesn't exist"

/sure you can figure it out for yourself.&gt; The idea that there are feminists trying to stop people talking about issues like male suicide is quite insane. 

[I'm honestly no longer sure if you're stupid or a liar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARHCxAMAO0)

&gt; I agree.

Whilst I'm delighted to hear that, your assumptions about who has power and who does not in our society are so far removed from who actually has power and who does not, that you still think that men cannot be victims of inequality which is beyond absurd. 

&gt; Not the exact same, but to the similar degree, yes.

So you think that David Cameron and a white, able, cis, heterosexual male on a sink estate on Teeside have the same privileges? What privileges do you think those are?

&gt; Do you think hate crime exists against heterosexual couples?

A better question to ask would be why should hate crimes be treated any differently from other crimes when the victim suffers exactly the same regardless of the motives of the offender.https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/3gck1f/this_sub_isnt_going_to_work_if_people_keep/

[Male feminists are hilarious.](http://kareningalasmith.com/2013/12/16/thanks-and-all-but-no-thanks-i-dont-want-men-in-my-feminism/)I hope your grammar about the "could of/have" was better there? If you think reddit has grammar Nazis, TakiMag puts us to shame!I know, I've read your posts in this thread and agree with you, I'm just highlighting the one thing that stood out from that post that needed addressing.&gt; No, it doesn't. There's a reason the definition of rape specifically includes oral penetration.

There is also a reason the definition of rape excludes envelopment/being made to penetrate. But there is a difference between enthusiastic blow jobs and oral rape, as exemplified by my reference to the gagging type porn vid's earlier. 

&gt; The law is not on your side.

Tell me about it! As a man, I'm more likely to be found guilty, given a longer sentence and be hauled up in the first place. But that doesn't make it right. 

&gt; The circumstances and a reasonable belief in consent are taken into account.

No they aren't, although that might be how things should be in theory. In practice however the opposite is True as a conviction is sought and doubt is cast on the reasonable belief in consent as we discussed in our previous exploration of the Ched Evans case in the discussion we got into last month. 

&gt; I find the accusation of sexism amusing

You find the fact that men cannot be raped by women under English Common Law by engaging in sex with them without consent (unless they penetrate the man) amusing? 

&gt; Noone is forcing people to rape.

Other than those changing the definitions of rape to include where consent is informed, meaningful and enthusiastically given throughout, you mean?

&gt; They break the law of their own free will, and should suffer the requisite punishment.

So you agree with me that if there is no mens rea then they haven't committed rape?Marriage being a legal ceremony under the auspices of the nation state is a relatively recent thing, although there have been legal connotations to the religious ceremony for thousands of years. In fact, it is precisely because there have been legal connotations to the sacred vows made in the religious ceremony that the state took a formal interest in marriage and the led to the situation we now have today where it has in effect been appropriated by the state and the bodies responsible for giving it the status it has non-consensually divorced from it. Ironic, really, that at the same time this has happened the actual divorce rate has exploded. In this thread I have stated that enthusiastic consent in delivering a blow job can be differentiated from merely having a penis in one's mouth and not removing it so far as consent is concerned. I understood from your engagement thus far that you accepted enthusiastic consent as a barometer of actual consent being given?

&gt; If we define condoning as to accept/permit morally deficient behaviour, albeit tacitly or with reluctance, then you have condoned rape as far as the law is concerned. 

If we define rabbits as grapefruit, breakfast becomes far more interesting but it doesn't make rabbits grapefruit. Morally deficient behaviour that is within the parameters of the law is not condoning rape. Pointing out that the goalposts of the law are in the wrong position for ensuring justice is delivered is not condoning rape either. 

&gt; You may disagree with the law. But dissent is not a legal defense.

Were I ever to be charged with rape I will remember these wise words when up in front of the judge ;-)&gt; And millions of people don't believe it's a religious ceremony. 

I don't believe it is a religious ceremony but I understand that others do and see no need to cause them unnecessary distress by redefining their definition of marriage in law when perfectly adequate alternatives in the form of civil unions were an option. 

&gt; Do you think atheists should be allowed to be married?

Only if they are not poor ;-)

&gt; Fine, if the state says everyone has to have a civil partnership, and if religious people then want to go off and have whatever ceremony they want, that's cool. Remove the state entirely from marriage. No tax breaks &amp;c &amp;c from a marriage, only from a legal, state recognised civil partnership. 

Well, that was relatively easy to get agreement on! If only all reddit debates were like this!&gt; Child courts favour women because of a pre-conceived notion of what women should be (mothers) rather than any pre-conceived notion towards men.

You can always tell those who haven't done their research by seeing if they attempt this counter-argument. Children of divorce used to go to the father before WWI. Do you know why? Do you know why it changed in between the wars? It has literally nothing to do with the pre-conceived notion that women should be mothers. That's feminist bullshit to propagate the idea of patriarchy, but it's entirely unTrue. They've been lying to you and you bought it. Allow me to quote [Karen Straughan](http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/when-female-privilege-backfires-2/) to explain:

&gt; When men received automatic custody after divorce, it was because they were solely obligated to support the children. When early feminists pushed through the TYD, that obligation did not shift onto women\u2013mothers got custody, but fathers were still required to provide material support. Incidentally, once this doctrine was in place, the divorce rate, which had been a constant for centuries, increased 15-fold in just 50 years. Huh.

Huh, indeed. The whole "systematic sexism against women" screed that feminists have been trying to make mainstream for the past 40 or 50 years begins to unravel when looked at closely. The arguments don't hold water and even taking into account feminist theory can still be shown to be wrong, even when feminists dismiss objective proof as patriarchal. 

&gt; I don't know enough about the other examples you provided to comment, which I admit to. Maybe OP can comment here, as I feel she shares my POV here. 

I respect your honesty so won't make any digs other than to say that perhaps you might consider that there is an entire other side to the narrative you have been presented with and accepted that shows it up for the conspiracy theory it is and that by doing your own research into both sides of the debate you can remove the wool that has been pulled over your eyes and see that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes after all.Well, you know what they say...

Because marriage has *meaning* and *purpose* to them and anyone wanting to do so needs to adhere to the meaning and purpose or it diminishes what they see as sacred. 

&gt; I just don't think marriage IS a religious thing.

Well, obviously it isn't a religious thing to most people, but being that most non-religious people who get married do so for the same reasons and purpose espoused by those who take the religious aspects of marriage very seriously this isn't a problem.

&gt; I have no problem with religious people having their marriage be as much about god as they want.

But to them it is the institution of marriage that matters, not just their own marriages (indeed many may not be married). 

&gt; THEY (or, a minority of them, anyway) are the ones with the problem with other people getting married. 

They have no problem with other people getting married, they have a problem with other people usurping what they see as the meaning and purpose of marriage to turn something they see as holy into something profane. You don't have to agree with this to understand it which is why I am having such a hard time believing you don't get this.

&gt; They can define marriage as however religious as they want. The state, on the other hand, doesn't. 

Then why can't the state enact civil unions for hetero and homo couples and let the churches provide marriage ceremonies that remain a religious event and keep everyone happy?Interesting spin you put on the threads. It would be more accurate to describe them thus:

* It is unacceptable to criticise feminism
* Masculinity is bad
* Men's rights activists are bad
* Men shouldn't be able to take criticism in the same way that feminists cannot
* Women deserve reproductive options that men do not

If you were being honest, of course. And then we have:

&gt; Then we finish with an article by a fringe writer who doesn't want men talking about women's issues. 

These views aren't fringe, aren't rare and aren't nice:

I'm really sorry that the world isn't how you think it should be. If it makes you feel any better it isn't how anyone else thinks it should be either, me included. But it is how it is, not how you seem to see it. That's something that you'll either have to deal with or live with the cognitive dissonance the rest of your life and for someone capable of engaging in debate about an issue they clearly feel strongly about without resorting to downvoting those who disagree with them, as you have not downvoted me, that won't be a pleasant way to go through life. David Miliband, Chuka Umunna and Dan Jarvis appear to be the frontrunners at the moment, but it is still early days yet.This thread is useless without pics (feels like FARK saying that here).[Pwns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk)?No, negging is a backhanded compliment, like "Not everyone would have the confidence to wear that", he was attempting to be cocky/funny in the mould of more conventional PUA without apparently succeeding but an emoticon and a sufficiently attractive profile could have made all the difference to how his message was interpreted. It's funny because on the one hand you accuse people who believe that marriage is holy matrimony of bigotry without realising that doing so is displaying that very same bigotry you are accusing them of! And it has nothing to do with religious freedom and everything to do with profaning what religious people see as sacred. That's why the state should provide civil unions under law for both heterosexuals and homosexuals and leave the holy side of things to the churches.&gt; Yes. It has meaning and purpose to me too. It has meaning and purpose to gay couples who want to get married, too. 

It might have meaning and purpose for [others](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2356774/Australian-woman-Jodi-Rose-marries-bridge-France--gets-mayors-blessing.html) too, but if the differing meanings and purposes conflict with the one responsible for the institution's societal importance in the first place and the problem can be resolved without profaning what the religious see as sacred by adopting civil unions for the state and leaving marriage as the religious side of things then everyone can come away happy instead of deliberately and unnecessarily distressing people who cling to their religious beliefs. 

&gt; Most gay couples who get married do so for the exact same reasons.

I see someone hasn't explained to you what homosexuality entails when it comes to producing children. Not to worry, you can ask your mummy and daddy about it when you get older ;-)

&gt; The only ones trying to restrict it here are those religious people (and a few non-religious) who think THEIR definition of marriage has to be the LEGAL definition, despite the majority of people disagreeing with them.

They don't think their definition is the legal one, they think that their definition is the one ordained by God and is therefore sacred. Call me a softy, but I just don't see the need to deliberately upset such people when civil unions can easily be made available to couples of all sexualities.

&gt; Tough shit, frankly. There are plenty of people who think drinking on the Sabath is bad, but that's their problem, not mine.

You haven't been drinking on the Sabbath, have you, Eggy? You're everlasting soul will spend eternity in damnation! ;-) Seriously though, it's like Muslim's getting upset about images of Mohamed. It's one thing to say people should be free to draw Mohamed without fearing reprisals but it's another thing entirely to call Muslims bigots for getting upset at people for doing something they see as distressing. 

&gt; Do you think we should stop eating beef because Hindus think they are holy animals? 

This is ironically actually a closer example to having gay marriage banned rather than being forced to accept it. 

&gt; I'm fairly certain that if the state decided to stop recognising marriages as "official", legal events, that there would be outrage.

The state already does this. Didn't you know? A wedding ceremony without legal registration doesn't count in the UK.You do realise there is a huge grey line in determining what constitutes consent? &gt; The premises that you have once again repeated, specifically that marriage is "union of a man and a woman for the purposes of creating a stable environment for procreation and child rearing for time immemorial".
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Creating a stable environment for child rearing is but one of the reasons why people enter into the optionally religious institution of marriage. Other purposes include love, companionship, acquisition and unification of land and other property, tax avoidance, diplomacy...

Those reasons don't conflict with the premise.

&gt; How is it below anyone to ask someone else to substantiate an assertion, let alone one as absurd as your claim "the child rearing aspects of marriage are very much not entirely optional"?

&gt; As for your strawman concerning "guaranteed outcomes" I clearly never made any such claim. What I did do is ask you to provide some evidence that heterosexuals who are infertile (such as post menopausal women, castrati, eunuchs... to use historical examples) or heterosexuals who intend not to have children are excluded from Christian marriage.

You literally go from straw manning to accusing me of straw manning in one paragraph. And you did make that claim by referring to people who cannot have children getting married. 

&gt; If as you claim that "Marriage has been the religiously sanctified union of a man and a woman for the purposes of creating a stable environment for procreation and child rearing for time immemorial." And that consequently same sex couples who cannot have children are justly excluded from it then clearly heterosexual men and women who are unable or unwilling to procreate should also be excluded.

Because they cannot intend to have children with their partner?

&gt; But they aren't, the reason being that contrary to your claims child rearing is anything but "the purpose" of marriage. On the contrary child bearing and rearing is one of the optional purposes of marriage, just as the religious aspects of marriage are optional.

Not to those that hold marriage as a religious covenant they aren't. Look, it really isn't difficult and I don't know why you are attempting to conflate my views with those of religious believers, but they believe that the state of holy matrimony is sacred and that it profanes it to deliberately make of it something it is not, particularly so when what you are trying to make it into is considered a sin according to their religion.

&gt; An example of what exactly? Beyond you desperately grasping for an argument that is.

An example of the religious imperative to get married and have children. And you can fuck right off with your insults - you're the one incapable of understanding what the other side of the argument is. IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF FEMINISTS TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES LIKE MALE SUICIDE, you cretin! The very thing you said that believing it happens was "quite insane". Credit where credit is due. &gt; the fact that you keep mixing both aspects (civil and religious) demonstrates that you don't quite grasp that

/sigh

No, it demonstrates that I very much DO understand that currently marriage and civil unions are equatable and that drawing a distinction between the two would solve the problem that religious people have with calling things that they do not see as marriage, "marriage". 

&gt; We don't anymore live in times when marriage is mainly religious (non believers get married as much as others), we don't anymore live in times when the church is a public institution, and we don't anymore live in times when it is allowed to meddle in public issues, and all that thanks to the wonderful invention of secularism. You can't therefore force the reactionnary christian view of marriage down people's throat

Virtually all of our traditions, cultural values and so on stem from our Christian heritage. By your argument we should also abandon English Common Law. Why is it so hard for you to accept calling civil unions "civil unions" rather than "marriage" in order to avoid distressing a few old grannies? 

&gt; the interest of a more equal-in-law society as a whole has to be put in front of the sensitivity of a really conservative fringe who just can't tolerate a society moving forward (meaning out of its control).

This argument would have some validity if MARRIAGE WASN'T A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION, but it is!

&gt; The civil marriage doesn't pretend to anything holy, that's for the church ceremony to settle

Which was great until civil marriage expanded to include things that profane the religious idea of marriage. 

&gt; Btw, you say " leave the holy side of things to the churches" but what are the boundaries of "the holy side of things" ? Do you actually think a democratic society in the XXIst century should leave societal matters in the hands of the church ?

I thought it was self explanatory; deal with the civil union side of things by registering a marriage at a registry and the religious thing by getting 'married' in a church.Wow, this is a five month old thread. How did you even find it? Upvoted for the effort!

Also, what if a woman makes a False rape claim in anger after finding out that the guy has a girlfriend or something and then feels she can't withdraw it because of the heavy legal consequences she faces for doing so? It seems unfair to put the guy through that if it can be prevented.

Also, lie detectors don't actually work, they just have a placebo effect.&gt; nobody knows why the UK has done so badly at improving output per hour

Of course we know why! It's a combination of excessive worker protections, a too generous welfare system, overmanning, red tape and a culture of presentiism. 

We also know that the way to fix this is to remove artificial drivers to living costs, like in-work benefits, scrap the minimum wage (which acts as a wage ceiling for unskilled labour and again creates inflationary pressure for the poorest in society), enable improved worker autonomy and link rewards to achievement. 

&gt; Right now, the government subsidises low-paid work

No it doesn't. This betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of in-work benefits which are not a subsidy to employers but a short-term bribe to voters until living costs rise to meet new incomes, at which point they've outlived their usefulness and become a lodestone around the neck of the economy as we are now seeing.

&gt; People should be willing to work for less when they know the state will top up their meagre incomes.

If they lose out on unemployment benefits like council tax allowance, housing benefit and such, then it isn't worth working 40 hours a week for a couple of extra pounds in your pocket. Taxing people less and giving fewer benefits is the only way to make work pay.

&gt; And if that weren\u2019t bad enough, OBR expects the biggest beneficiaries of the change are relatively well-off already

When a system has previously been too progressive to the point it incentivises not working, it is inevitable that correcting that problem is going to mean those who are at the bottom lose out and those who are higher up get better off. This is a good thing when the pendulum has swung too far the other way and shouldn't be painted as a negative.

&gt; The net effect of all this should be lower employment and higher wages among those who didn\u2019t leave.

Actually, if growth takes off, as it in theory should all things being equal, then over the medium term you would expect employment to improve as firms expand. The short term effects should be only temporary.Whilst I'm not against China's involvement, I sincerely agree with the stifling effect political correctness has had on critics of their involvement. This isn't a left/right issue and political correctness needs to be excised from debate.It's obviously not satire as you'd be aware if you even read the whole sentence you quote as it refers to overmanning, red tape and presentiism as well as worker protections and welfare (specifically out of work benefits). In work benefits do NOT subsidise corporate wages as I explained in my third paragraph. And the very fact that we have them in the first place shows who really runs the place and runs a train through your conspiracy theory.The reason they are protesting Warren Farrell is to stop him speaking about men's issues, including suicide. He hasn't said anything remotely controversial about rape or feminism and indeed still self-identifies as a feminist having done so for over four decades. This kind of thing goes on to a lesser extent everywhere from UK universities through to the House of Commons as we saw with the Philips v Davies situation of the other day.

Now not all feminists want to stop people talking about men's issues but enough do that it is a real problem. And whether you like it or not you are on the side of those doing the censorship. If you want to do something about it, great, I'll applaud you, but at the moment by attempting to portray this serious issue as a tinfoil hat conspiracy you are doing the opposite of what you attest with regard to preventing people talking about men's issues.It doesn't take a genius to understand that excessive worker protections have a negative net effect on workers as employers instead turn to temp staff and self-employment options to mitigate their risks. As for overmanning, it's less of a problem than it used to be but one look at the civil service shows you how bloated the public sector is. Red tape is an issue for everyone across the EU but let us not pretend that all states take it as seriously as the UK does in terms of adhering to it. Presentiism is a particularly anglo-centric problem, although there are elements of it on the continent too, especially in more cosmopolitan areas. Nevertheless, addressing it would also improve worker satisfaction and productivity as no one wants to be sat in the office doing nothing like the Japanese do.

Also, I frequently condemn the right for downvoting for disagreement when those on the left are clearly contributing to the discussion and as a result regularly upvote material posted that I disagree with. Is it too much to ask that the favour be returned?Interesting that it was you who posted this. Personally I doubt that anyone is starving to death as a result of benefit cuts. The only case that has been reported was a guy with severe eating and mental disorders and you can be sure that those ideologically opposed to the cuts would be all over it if there were a valid example out there. You don't need a study for logical argument. Studies just show evidence that supports or refutes arguments, they don't address the logic of the argument themselves. 

The last part was directed at whoever has been downvoting for disagreement. I'd assumed that wasn't you but I'd accept your upvote if you want to argue against what I've posited. I don't think it is particularly loaded. Corbyn is either a minor blip or an unrecoverable mistake.

I think as he is being bundled out he says it was "Can I ask a question?"&gt; strong social protection improves productivity just look to the Nordic model, stripping back worker protection and regulation might make business more lucrative for the few but its at the expense of normal people. 

Au contraire. It is the culture that makes Nordic countries more efficient in terms of production. As I've pointed out elsewhere in this thread, strong worker protections come at the expense of normal people as employers look to mitigate their risks by relying on temporary staff and self-employment practices to mitigate their risks. 

&gt; The UK isn't a business and shouldn't be treated like one decisions should be made on there value i n increasing everyones quality of life.

Yes it should. Treating it like a business makes it more efficient with people willing and able to pay for the things they value themselves far more efficiently than the en mass system we currently have. This would be funny if you didn't actually come across as being sincere. The younger the person, the more pro-EU they are likely to be.

Again, nothing controversial about the facts. They're just unpopular with those who's power is being challenged (oh, the irony!)

&gt; They were obviously reason they were protesting against him and not because for some odd reason they don't want people talking about male suicide.

Grammar issues with your statement aside, they were trying to prevent him talking about male suicide because that is one of the issues he was going to talk about. But even if that were not so and he wasn't going to talk about suicide that still doesn't make what feminists did any more acceptable, defensible or right. That can surely only be based on today's usage. With technological advancements even with Moore's Law you'd expect that figure to at least quadruple as usage expands exponentially over the coming decade.Because the consequences of getting too progressive with taxation are a worsening economy.Under Corbyn?&gt; I don't know how ya'll are adding your height next to your name

I think it's a minor blip and that with someone like Starmer or Jarvis in charge Labour can and will be a real contender in 2020. &gt; Got anything to justify it?

It's necessarily True. The only issue is what constitutes a "too progressive" taxation system. Virtually everyone agrees that 100%+ is too progressive as it lead to the brain drain when it was adopted. And even the most libertarian and flatest tax proponents agree the state needs to provide certain basic functions even if it is only security, democracy and rule of law. Somewhere in between is the Laffer Curve and somewhere to the left of that is the optimal sustainable tax rate. I believe that at the moment we are somewhere between the sustainable optimal tax-rate and the Laffer Curve and that reducing tax and cutting government spending effectively will improve growth at a greater rate yielding better results for improving living standards of the poorest faster and more efficiently and effectively than adopting a more progressive tax system that will stifle growth and entrepreneurship and that whilst on paper may appear to insulate the poorest against reduced living standards in real terms will do less so than making the pie bigger for everyone.The donors are the one hope us right Eurosceptics have of making the referendum a fair one, but realistically the EU gravy train is too appealing for anyone with any significant power from wanting to derail it.&gt; Why are they not (partially) a subsidy to employers, 

Because we have a minimum wage.

&gt; and why will living costs automatically rise to balance the increase in income from tax credits?

Demand and supply.

&gt; Under the tax credit reforms some people only keep about 20-30% of any wage increases they get, and have worse incentives to work than before.

Yes, this is a real problem. A complete overhaul of the tax system is needed to properly incentivise work but it isn't going to happen so instead we have mere tinkering around the edges. But so long as someone in full time work has to pay council tax this problem isn't going to go away.

&gt; The effect of this is to change the structural rate of unemployment, or the NAIRU, depending on how you think of it. It's not just a short term effect, it increases the floor below which unemployment won't fall.

Not necessarily as the economy can expand as it grows, but yes, you are right that it is probable. Still, getting unemployment down is often a beneficial side effect of a waxing economy. Well, it is the Telegraph. You would hardly expect them to say is Corbyn good or utterly amazing. The question is how significantly the audience feels Corbyn stewardship of the party will set Labour back. Personally I don't feel he'll be around long enough to make much difference but has galvanised grass roots support that was alienated by Blairism so I'd answer a minor blip but I don't see the question being loaded to that answer or the other.But that is what the article is about. And the answers don't seem to be loaded as to one or the other even if the presuppose agreement with the author. Either way the poll is for those who think that Corbyn is a setback for the Labour party and I can't see that either answer appears to be loaded to favour it over the other.Thanks for contributing but it doesn't say that those 33 people killed themselves "as a result" of the welfare reforms. And frankly, many people have kept going under far more trying circumstances than receiving slightly less money from the state. People kill themselves because they have sever mental injuries or illnesses, not because their income drops slightly. If their income drops then they reprioritise their budget, they don't kill themselves.The graph shows age demographics moving consistently away from the EU with increased age and towards the EU with reduced age. It says exactly what I suggested it says. Meh, apologies, it was the first one that came up in a search I did for EU support by age demographic but I can't find the source now. I believe it was part of a series done across all EU member states in June 2015 by the EU themselves if you're interested in tracking it down.Interesting that you'd come back to this after a fortnight...?

They still measure stress responses though which means that regardless of whether the person is lying or not the results only show an emotional response to the question. Their strength and purported reliability remains in the placebo effect. You've never had to tell me. Am I going to have to start telling you that the Russians and Europeans stole the ideas of Locke and Smith and then found that their later anarchism and socialism takes on libertarianism didn't work because those systems were incompatible with the balance needed between rule of law and free markets?&gt; Yes they do because your claim is that reproduction is the purpose of marriage, when in reality it has long been one of the optional purposes of marriage.

No, it is still the purpose of *religious* marriage, which is why religious types take it as a personal affront and attack on their beliefs.

&gt; Please lay out the chain of reasoning by which you came to that conclusion.

a) I state the child rearing aspects of religious marriage are not optional for believers.

b) You imply I was stating that the child rearing aspects of marriage apply to the intent of anyone getting married.

c) You wrote "So can you cite for me the Anglican, Catholic... rules which bar infertile people and fertile people who don't want children from marrying?"

d) This is a straw man as I never argued that any religious precept bars infertile people from marrying as at the time such knowledge wasn't possible, so instead it was codified around men and women.

&gt; obviously, by definition people who are "unwilling to procreate" "cannot intend to have children with their partner", if they intended to have children they obviously wouldn't be "unwilling to procreate".

But people who are infertile can still intend to have children. Even those who are aware they are infertile can still intend for it to happen. 

&gt; Repeating an assertion is not the same thing as substantiating it.

Substantiating an assertion is the same thing as substantiating an assertion though and that is what I have done vis a vis the religious objection to gay marriage. I'm not trying to substantiate whether their view is correct or not, such a matter is subjective and cannot be substantiated, merely to substantiate what it is and that it is valid according to their beliefs. 

&gt; I keep on asking you to provide even the slightest scrap of evidence that theists regard "the child rearing aspects of marriage are very much not entirely optional" and you keep on failing to do so because they believe no such thing. 

I didn't realise you spoke for all religious people's views. Obviously you are necessarily wrong because believers have [divergent views](https://bible.org/question/it-sin-christian-married-couple-not-have-children-if-they-can) on the issue. If you're interested in the details of the religious debate there is probably an /r/christianity where you can get into things a bit more than with me. I'm only interested in the what of their beliefs, not the why. 

&gt; As has already been established there's no mention of marriage in that passage. Let alone a command that marriage be entered into exclusively for child rearing.

Because you keep going on about it I've looked into it a little and it does say this. Genesis 1:28 coupled with the verses listed [here](http://www.openbible.info/topics/having_children_outside_of_marriage) makes that clear. Again, you don't have to agree with it to understand it.You seriously think unions don't exert power and influence over their members (and non members too for that matter)?Unions have a great deal of influence over what personal views and opinions individual members can express and can and do use that influence to negatively affect those who proffer opinions the union disagrees with. &gt; you're under the impression that their income is only dropping slightly - it isn't!

It's not really relevant whether it is slight or not, it's still no reason to kill yourself. That said, there are always alternatives. The state literally does not force anyone to starve to death. But it cannot force people to avail themselves of the services it offers. 

&gt; you're right that often these people have severe mental or physical illnesses and disabilities

That doesn't necessarily mean that they require more money than other people who aren't disabled. But there do need to be safeguards to ensure that such people don't fall through the cracks and I'd support the left in holding IDS and the DWP to account on this.The NUT's raison d'etre is to spread it's influence. Literally the sole reason it exists.But it isn't asking people who think X isn't a problem, it is asking people who think that X is a problem, which is why it doesn't seem loaded. It's literally 'If X then Y or Z'?Again though, it isn't saying is Corbyn bad or very bad, it is saying *IF* Corbyn is bad, is he bad or very bad?It's asking how bad he is because it presupposes that he is bad because *he is actually bad* in the sense meant in the article as demonstrated by his approval ratings.&gt; I am in no way blindly pro-union but to say that the NUT exists solely to further its own 'influence' (whatever is meant by that ambiguity) and nothing else seems silly.

Unions are by definition pressure groups. They exist for the sole purpose of spreading their influence. Now this influence can take different forms across different unions, whether it be for improved workers rights, higher wages, better health and safety or political matters, but the union's purpose is to spread that influence. That doesn't mean that all members agree and it doesn't mean that the union will succeed but it does mean that the reason the union exists is to try and bring about something. It does this through attempting to increase its influence until it can achieve its goals. That is what unions are for. It literally is their sole purpose. I'm not sure how else I can explain it. I'm sure Futrelle does.That is certainly part of it, yes. The NUT funds Labour and donates time, resources and effort into that goal. But the NUTs overarching purpose is to spread its influence, same as any other union.

&gt; There is an assumption that because some people have racist abuse hurled at them, they aren't in turn racist themselves.

The traditions are anti-authoritarian and in the 20th Century in particular the left has had almost a monopoly on authoritarianism. Within living memory libertarianism has been associated with the right.Rain or fog, I think you could make a strong case. Congestion? That's a little harder...Rule 167 specifically addresses this.I did say "almost" a monopoly as either Russia or China alone far outweighs the combined right wing authoritarianism of the last century. But fascist regimes like those of Mussolini or Franco were so far removed from basic conservatism, let alone right-libertariansim, which as I'm sure you are aware came to prominence as a response to WWII, that to ask the likes of Churchill or Thatcher to make it clear that it was not in their name would be absurd in a way that it isn't for the Trotskyites, Maoists, Stalinists, Marxists, Communists, Socialists, etc. many of whom supported left wing authoritarianism/totalitarianism. 

Interesting that you throw in an appeal to authority at the end, slating Rand. Your argument would have been stronger without that.&gt; The point I am making is that the left-wing dictatorships had criticisms coming thick and fast from the left, in a way that Fascism did not.

Yes, I have understood that which is why I pointed out in my rebuttal why the corollary to that was absurd.

&gt; And these criticisms were not superficial and done in a hand-wringing I-need-to-distance-myself sort of way, these were serious ideological and theoretical and moral arguments.

They might have heartfeltly been so but that doesn't change the fact that they were hand-wringing I-need-to-distance-myself excuses that were very much needed to retain any credibility too.

&gt; Trotsky ended up with an ice-pick in his head over them, and Rosa Luxembourg gave most of them from a prison cell before being shot in the head.

The left will eat itself...

&gt; This shows quite plainly that the Stalinist and Maoists don't have the monopoly on 20th century left-wing thought, even if they did have the monopoly on left-wing violence

They also dominated left wing thought throughout the last century and pointing out that there were other splinter factions within the left doesn't change that.

&gt; And, I might also add that libertarian socialism is about the free association of people pursuing their desires without coercion.

Socialism *IS* coercion, taking the means of production from private hands and putting them into public ownership without the consent of the private owners. 

&gt; Ayan Rand, by contrast, advocates for maximum selfishness in the psychopathic belief that this will lead to freedom.

Ayn Rand carried Smith's theories to their natural conclusion, that self interest is the best way to power markets, which is objectively (no pun intended) correct. Greed, for lack of a better word, is good - as Gordon Gecko says. She lied to the guy about taking her birth control and you care more that she's continued sleeping with someone she's been sleeping with for more than a year? You have your priorities all wrong.

And it is none of your business who other grown adults choose to sleep with. You don't have to approve of what she's doing but unless it is your boyfriend she is sleeping with you get no say.&gt; we need to promote progressive Islam.

Considering doing so is punishable by death under actual Islam I can only wish you good luck with that.It's not a straw man. There are many on the left who see the West/UK as always in the wrong. From George Galloway to Seumas Milne, the left is ridden with these views in the UK. Sure, not all on the left hold such views but enough do to have enough prominence that this seems a hallmark for the non-centre left.No it doesn't. Or rather it demonstrates how anti-austerity is an ideological choice not even masked as sensible politics. Tax credits contribute to a wage/price spiral that leaves the poorest facing the highest inflation in their living costs. This needs to end to reduce their living costs to actual market levels and enable growth that is currently being lost by subsidising their living costs to meet the higher level they are at as a result of the subsidy!It's not in anyone's interests to discourage saving for pensions when it is currently run as a ponzi scheme. Appeal to authority fallacy. Osborne should be judged on his results i.e. taking the UK from being in the poorest shape at the start of the recession to in the best shape now, not which theorists think he is right and which think 
he is wrong.

Edit: typoHe's not wrong though. And do you know *why* Osborne has missed the original targets? Because the economy improved to the point that it was no longer so pressing to meet them as the economy grew. Had Osborne pushed for the targets the pain felt by average people as the economy righted itself would be felt more abruptly. Instead the blow has been cushioned. &gt; who gets to decide who is or isn't protesting peacefully

The courts do.He's a Labour voter.Yes, that is exactly what I am implying. Actual Islam is immutable and cannot be changed, reinterpreted or otherwise amended because it is the exact word of God to it's believers. It's actually not that difficult a concept to grasp and I am consistently surprised by how few people on the left seem to understand the relatively straightforward concept:

1. The economy was in a bad state and Osborne set severe yet achievable targets to put it right.

1. The election of the Tories coupled with the seriousness of the targets restored confidence to markets and things improved better than expected as a result.

1. Because of this it was possible to loosen the initial targets which mean that people wouldn't suffer as much and the impact of the economy being put right could be cushioned.

That's all there is to it. 

Edit: typo&gt; That isn't the corollary, unless you believe Thatcher and Churchill are fascists. 

They aren't fascists but they are right wing. The left's apologists aren't necessarily Maoists but they are left wing. I was pointing out the differences in the parallels as to why the right doesn't need to apologise for fascism (i.e. because it doesn't support it) but the left does need to apologise for Marxism (i.e. because it does support it).

&gt; Can you cite a passage from anything anyone from the Left Opposition that looks remotely "hand-wringing"? 

Anything about the USSR not being *real* Communism.

&gt; The blithe remarks are jolly amusing but perhaps you might instead focus your energies on writing something cogent?

Sincere apologies, I thought you'd understand the relevance and why it was more than just a pithy quote. It was referring to the very fractures within the left that resulted in Trotsky being assassinated and all that stuff.

&gt; They weren't "splinter factions" they were a large minority within a party

I refer to splinter factions because there were so many different ones rather than because they were necessarily small. People's Front of Judea versus the Popular People's Front and all that.

&gt; Only in its marxist leninist variation. But in any case, the capitalist class are the original warrior thieves who took land that wasn't theirs by force of arms. 

Unless the means of production are voluntarily purchased from a willing seller, they are coercively obtained. And, yes, if we go back far enough we end up with some leader who took things by force. 

&gt; It isn't objectively anything, but if it were to be objectively something it would be the exact opposite of what Ayn Rand and Gordon Gecko (ah, what philosopher-kings the libertarian capitalist tradition has!), objectively wrong, in other words.

I think migration patterns are the best evidence I'm objectively right, but standard of living indexes, GDP, freedom indices, etc. all confirm the same thing.&gt; Why, if the women in question are obviously adults with fully formed and functioning brains, is this deemed even remotely acceptable?

[The article explains the analogy](http://no-maam.blogspot.fr/2012/06/woman-most-responsible-teenager-in.html). What don't you understand?&gt; But there are loads of different interpretations of Islam.

And you may have noticed that those of each of these different interpretations frequently try and kill those who follow the other interpretations. 

&gt; How can you reconcile that reality with your idea of Islam as an unchangeable monolith.

Because all denominations agree on it, which is *why* they try and kill each other. Read what I wrote and stop embarrassing yourself. I'm *agreeing with you* and pointing out that you don't need this for your initial argument to still be correct. &gt; who cares if your husband or boyfriend sleeps around and impregnates a couple of other women? It won\u2019t make any difference

It would make a huge difference to most women if the father of their children's resources go 100% to them and their offspring or only 50%, 33%, 25%, etc.Majority on the far left? Could well be. Majority on the left? I'd hope that was unlikely. We're talking about the same targets. 

I understand why Osborne has done what he has done but am not entirely convinced that the political benefits are worth the economic costs. It's undeniably a brilliant gambit though even if it isn't what I would have necessarily done. Am I horrified by his performance? Of course not, he's done a remarkably good job considering what he inherited, which was not a recovery but another spending-based bubble.Sadly it isn't limited to religion as Communism and Fascism have shown us in the previous century, but there is nothing unfair or inaccurate about singling out the single greatest causal factor of conflict in the world today as being Islam. Had Charlie Hebdo, 7/7 the Madrid train bombings, etc. been carried out by groups other than Islamic fundamentalist terrorists and [95% of current conflicts in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts) being waged by Islamic fundamentalist terrorists then it might be fair to say what you say about comparing other beliefs.&gt; one must distinguish between an ideology that has no critics who are of that same ideology and an ideology that has many, many critics by those who are of that ideology

Exactly. Apologists for Stalinism, etc. on the left share similar views. Those on the right do not share similar views with fascists. 

&gt; Nanny State Capitalism and Crony Capitalism is certainly better than feudalism or dictatorships, but to be an improvement on them is not much of an achievement. 

So reduce the state and make the system more meritocratic. I'd be happy with that. &gt; You plainly don't understand. The economic consequences of Osborne's 2010-13 austerity was to kill growth. 2013+ growth returned as Osborne changed his plan. 

No, YOU clearly don't understand. Without restoring market confidence we wouldn't have growth. Austerity brought about that market confidence. Without it we would have had a depression or triple dip recession. 

&gt; As a Libertarian, I'm sure what ever amazing plan you'd come up with would be amazingly unworkable \ud83d\ude09

Suffice to say it wouldn't have been popular but would have got the economy growing more quickly a la Thatcher in the 1980s.

&gt; Reading that makes me think you're just a typical blinkered Tory, and your Libertarian tag is just you being #edgy

The tag is from the political compass, not my own appellation. And I have no party loyalties and vote on policy. 

&gt; If you look back, pre2008 Osborne didn't have a problem with labours spending.

I think Liam Byrne [said it best](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03269/handover_note_3269313b.jpg).

&gt; Like I also said, he inherited a recovering economy and proceeded to crash it.

I appreciate that nothing I can say is going to convince you why that is wrong but the pretty much universal consensus, even amongst Osborne's harshest critics, is that that is not what happened.If logical proof is not enough for you why would you believe scientific proof with all of it's lack of accountability for extraneous factors? The argument is women stop maturing because they face no accountability. Call it the Women Are Wonderful Effect or call it Patriarchy, the result is the same and it isn't disputed by any side of the argument.Milne isn't representative of the left either and is also a fucking idiot. But both are on the left, demonstrate a range of views on the left and yet have this in common. &gt; And what about the huge anti-stalinist and anti-fascist international struggle mounted by the Left Opposition and other socialists and radicals all over Europe and the United States, as well as Asia, are we to say that this means nothing?

If what they want is merely a different type of tyranny, then yes. If they are pro-freedom, then they aren't really socialists, are they? You can't have freedom without free-markets.

&gt; Are we to say that those who spoke far sooner, and far more eloquently against Stalinism and Fascism than Churchill ever did are meaningless?

No, not meaningless at all. Naive, often, but correct about the horrors of unabated leftism. 

&gt; I dare say corporate tyranny would make you happy. 

No type of tyranny would make me happy. But giving rewards to the deserving rather than the needy would.If you think you can have freedom without freedom, then you just go ahead and keep on thinking that.Haha! That's funny!I've no issue with the solutions either one proffers. The solutions they propose actually work even if they aren't necessarily popular or kind. Better to do something like that that actually makes a difference than something that is seen as popular and kind but has no effect more than virtue signaling or worse, encouraging whatever it is you're trying to prevent. Hitchen's views on single mothers are a case in point. You either be kind and generous and so get more (and hence more children brought up in poverty) or you are mean and nasty and so get fewer (again with fewer children brought up in poverty *and* greater resources to direct towards them because the resources aren't squandered on larger numbers in poverty). 

Edit: ~~virtual~~ *virtue*Vee bee leave in *nussing*!Logical proof is that because women are not held accountable for their actions in the same way that men are that they do not mature to the same extent as a result. &gt; we've had punitive justice systems for ages and it does little to actually prevent addiction, relapse and re-offending. 

The purpose of a punitive system is to punish. The prevention side of things is not the job of the prison service but the probation service.I vaguely remember a time when it *was* possible for my opinion of her to sink lower but that time has long since passed...Not interested, but thanks for the offer.

Great work and great find.You're missing the point. Whilst you are correct that this is very much a Red Pill issue (not PUA) it also goes a long way to explaining why divorce is so often initiated by wives and that there isn't anything guys can do about it. A message preaching that marriage is stacking the deck against yourself as a man is a message that very much should be here. Which one is the right answer? ;-)And yet by them giving voice to this bizarre conspiracy-theory level statement, they are. I think the Leave campaign has been pretty vocal in saying that financial reasons are one of the main reasons to leave. After all, we're a net contributor to the EU, second only to the Germans and even second only because Thatcher managed to obtain the rebate. Being free to trade as we like and without the heavy costs of membership we currently pay, unless business react completely irrationally we will be better off economically as a trading partner rather than a political partner of the EU. Society has demonstrated that women aren't held accountable for their actions, so much so that it has become a trope used in everything from movies like As Good As It Gets to have /r/PussyPass here on reddit. And if you don't understand that this is an analogy then it's no wonder you don't get The Red Pill. Are you Simon, OP? Or just his biggest fan? ;-)Sure, parents are prepared to pay for the privilege of having their children become sociopaths.The votes don't go to Corbyn, they go to their local MP. And whilst some may vote for their local MP in order to try and get Corbyn as PM, you can be absolutely certain that there is no way Corbyn will ever be PM.People care about their children for the most part and wouldn't pay for the privilege of turning them into sociopaths (not that that is what private school does).If they are going to get weapons, and they are, then why shouldn't we profit from it rather than someone else, especially if we then have a little greater influence as a result and can urge restraint and humanitarianism?&gt; unlike the current system where expensive treatments is the most profitable thing.

Wrong. Finding cheap cures but charging a lot for them is the most profitable thing. If taken absolutely literally it would be. But if you understand that women aren't held accountable for their actions and as a result aren't forced to mature until their looks fade and they no longer get away with what they used to, then it's not only not a leap at all but is patently obvious.You can be more certain of that than you can the sun will rise in the east tomorrow. You can argue pedantically that anything is possible but the reality is that some things aren't ever going to happen and Corbyn becoming PM is one of them.&gt; How exactly are women not held accountable for their actions? 

/r/PussyPass 

&gt; I'd argue women are even more cautious than men in a lot of contexts precisely b/c a fuck-up would be much more disastrous and carry more far-reaching consequences. 

Logic would dictate that, but culture has evolved so that women *don't* face consequences which is why they don't develop responsibility in the same way that men do. Everything from "never hit a woman" through to presumptions about intimate partner violence benefit women.

Certainly you regularly see women engaging in hostile behavior that you never see even psychopathic men engaging in on an average night out in a big city.TL;DR = "Devolution is good, but bad when the Tories do it!"

Not condescending, just pointing out the reality of Trickett's stance. He's attempting to dictate to local regions how they should receive devolved authority rather than how they themselves request it. By all means provide more alternatives but don't use that as an excuse to deny those who don't want the alternatives to not be able to have what they do want.Let's see, was she picked on an all women short list?

Over the past couple of decades the UK population has gone up by over 10 million people without the requisite infrastructure to support this growth which has meant that even with the rise in living standards people are not a lot better off in real terms than they were since the low point of the 1970s.

Germany is trying to 'conquer' Europe via the EU and France is as Vichy now as it was back then in supporting it. Each state wants to have their way within Europe and Germany just happens to be the state with the most power. That it is doing so ostensibly via democratic means doesn't change the nature of what it is trying to accomplish. It is most unfortunate that pointing this out simply isn't politically acceptable.These *are* kids but they are kids with no sense of responsibility and believe themselves untouchable in many cases. At least the thugs in the Ukraine don't have the same sense of entitlement. This isn't Pallywood. They genuinely think they are untouchable and frequently seem genuinely surprised when the police don't share their views. &gt; I think that tax credits cuts made this fast and of this severity are a mistake.

I disagree. Osborne is going slowly deliberately as a means of cushioning the blow but the result of this is the economy takes longer to be put right. Sometimes it is better to rip the plaster off rather than slowly peel it and this compromise he seems to be adopting at the moment isn't enough to win him any political gain and therefore is eking things out rather than getting them over quickly. There will be pain no matter which approach is taken but people can and will adjust their behaviour to compensate. 

Your proposals make more sense for going slowly than the method being attempted at the moment but it is still wrong to say that he's making cuts too quickly when he's not doing it fast enough (if he was going to do it fast at all).&gt; Regionalise the National Minimum wage

Can't do it. It will create too much London pull. It won't and he doesn't. &gt; One wonders how many officers salaries have been wasted on such things especially when they're getting Price Waterhouse Cooper to examine it. Their advice won't be cheap.

\u00a32k across each of six forces seems to have been the gist of it, so \u00a312k total-ish. Not an unreasonable sum to determine whether the formula was fit for purpose or not and was doubtless warranted as a risk-management exercise. That said, PCC's need to find ways to operate within their means and whining about how bad they've got it suggests they aren't up to the task rather than they haven't got enough money. 

&gt; If crime levels are far lower than they were at the peak of police numbers we don't need as many police.

The problem is that although fewer crimes are being reported (although not necessarily committed), it takes disproportionately more resources to detect those that do occur (and to respond as needed to crimes in progress). Prevention is all well and good and bobbies on the beat will always have a role to play but sanction detections are one of the few metrics of the police that matter and even though the books are cooked serious crimes are not something we want to see the unsolved rate (or wrongfully convicted rate) rise in and that means we need enough police officers to deliver that.Much as I'm tempted to agree, the UK is too overcongested on the roadways to warrant no speed limit but our current national speed limit is woefully too low. 100mph would seem reasonable.A thing is only worth what someone is prepared to pay for it. Too bad the Indian government doesn't do that.What for? We've already got the stone and [now we've got the recipe...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaGdwfykYGY)&gt; It's an insidious myth that most benefit claimant's are perfectly content with receiving benefits for the rest of their lives and have no further aspirations because of this. 

Considering that benefits are sufficiently generous that most people coming off benefits and onto NMW will only be a few thousand pounds (if that) better off working full-time (and some will be worse off) I'd say it isn't a myth at all. The simple fact is that the better the standard of living provided on benefits the less incentive there is to work.&gt; Most people likely can make it with \u00a326k, but that is no reason to punish the very, very few who (because of very particular individual circumstances) cannot.

The fairness issue is reason to 'punish' the thousands who cannot.

&gt; What if you need to be in X expensive location for example, because your child has a rare condition that requires very regular medical supervision by the country's only specialist? 

What if you're not on benefits and in the same situation?&gt; it's like people believe the poor are a different species more prone to gambling etc. 

There is a reason poverty tends to be repeated over generations and it has nothing to do with lack of social mobility.&gt; I think it's better to try and ensure that low paid work is more attractive (raising minimum wage, lowering taxes on the poorest) than to punish benefit claimants simply to try and scold them into finding work.

Well, yes, obviously it is preferable - it just isn't economically viable. 

&gt; You have to remember that not everyone will be able to find work, no matter how painful you make being on benefits/unemployed be.

Out of work benefits need to be sufficiently less appealing than working so that taking on a NMW role at 40 hours a week in an unsatisfying job, plus commute times and costs IS sufficiently appealing. No matter how much you raise in-work circumstances, out of work benefits need to be pretty bleak to make work appealing enough to be justifiable. 

&gt; Unemployment is a symptom of capitalism and no capitalist society has ever or will ever completely get rid of unemployment.

Yup, but that isn't the issue.

&gt; We need to accept that and stop blaming (and punishing) the unemployed for something which is inherent in the system.

This IS the issue. And unfortunately it has nothing to do with blame and everything to do with what is financially viable. Being out of work has to be unattractive enough that any full time job seems better. That simply isn't the case at the moment. You think rocks and stones are bad?

This has been downvoted but it's necessarily True, just as the reverse is also True (that wealth has increasing benefits over generations). This is obvious to the point of being uncontentious but people still downvote because it goes against their fragile and demonstrably incorrect belief system."I don't date black men".The unfairness! The *inhumanity*!I think the point being made was that Dave's Tories are conservative in name only."Janet Halley wrote in a piece for **Harvard Law Review**"

Until I hear confirmation otherwise, this happened.&gt; White girls are underrepresented compared to local population in the 2014 figures.

Without being funny, it is impossible to say (although the areas of Birmingham these things tended to happen in suggests that white girls are *over*-represented, unless you take the West Midlands population as a whole - although I doubt they were targeting Warwick or Leamington Spa as they weren't local to those areas).

&gt; I would rather suggest, to take another idiom, that you are missing the wood for the trees

Except this case is the trees and the other cases that all had remarkably similar perps and targets are the woods. Only an idiot would think that those who disagree with them aren't idiots! ;-)&gt; Because anyone who acknowledges that redistribution of wealth and debt reduction are viable alternatives to austerity is economically illiterate?

Yes.Ed Balls is no John McDonnell.&gt; First off, warwick and leamington, for example, aren't in the west midlands in the county sense - authorities are the urban conurbation plus coventry.

Technically True, but many commute to Birmingham and in practical terms they are the same area.

&gt; Second of all, because victims aren't going to be confined to a single ward, saying what the population in an area is a X time of day can only be an estimate.

Also technically True, but again with regard to the opportunism at the time the taxi driver gangs were operating it explains the rates at which non-white girls were abused because of availability rather than specific targeting as per your table.

&gt; However, it isn't like the white teen females in an area are unlikely to be able to access the town/city centres.

Except that at night that *IS* the case, both through access and through choice.

&gt; So your profile is wrong, ultimately. Of both offenders and victims, by the looks of it.

Again, only if you fail to differentiate between targeted and opportunistic. 

&gt; What is it about the word all that fascinates you?

For me, I think it is that it doesn't need to be taken absolutely literally to still be understood and have an accurate meaning. 

&gt; discounting online grooming, 33% of CSE cases in the snapshot involved Asians as offenders.

Because they've used a six month snapshot (from the document you posted earlier):

&gt; The profile of offenders for named suspects and offenders of incidents with a CSE marker (excluding online offending) for the first six months of 2014 is not the same as the profile of offenders identified in a range of problem profiles dating back to 2010, which used broader offender and / or suspect and intelligence data

&gt; Over-representation is one thing, and worthy of discussion, but claiming something obviously unTrue undermines your case.

Come on! They've admitted to cooking the books so as not to appear racist by pinning results across a six month period where there was a higher incidence of child sexual exploitation cases from atypical perps, despite the bigger picture confirming that the six-month picture is atypical!"Balldor!"&gt; It's an internal document obtained by FOI - there's no cooking of books going on for public consumption

That really isn't how this works. At all. 

&gt; It's intended for professionals wanting to be informed about CSE, publication was resisted

Nor is that.

&gt; You ignore actual evidence, because it doesn't conform to your prejudice, you're not providing any numbers of your own.

I'm not ignoring the evidence, I'm pointing out that it doesn't mean what you (or they) say it means. 

&gt; you are claiming something unsubstantiated, directly contradicted by the analysis of the police in the linked report, and I think you need to try to defend your point to continue this.

I'm using the same data as you, just interpreting it differently.

&gt; Produce numbers that substantiate your contention that only white girls are targeted, and non-whites are merely targets of opportunity.

The numbers don't show who is targeted, they don't differentiate between targeted and opportunistic exploitation. You have to interpret the data and take account of the spin. That's why there is scope for disagreement.&gt; Look, the tax credits thing is definitely complicated. It would have been dodgy to cut them without first putting meaningful pressure on business to pay people a proper wage. It is, however, weird and wrong that the state effectively tops up people\u2019s pay packets, so I hope we come back to this issue soon, and tackle it in a rational fashion.

I don't see how anyone can disagree with this sentiment.&gt; It kind of is. You get in a lot of trouble if you put out a document that is edited to change what is said.

What organisations like government departments or police services do is write a narrative that presents them as being politically correct. They use data, like the six months instead of the four years, to present their politically credentials. This ensures that when they are assessed on performance they can point to stuff and say "Look how wonderful we are!"

&gt; It factually is - the police resisted the request. It was intended for threat assessment to inform Council and Police action.

Looking at it I can honestly believe that the police refused the request because they didn't want it to get out how pandering to the PC brigade they were after all that has happened in the other cities I've already mentioned.

&gt; So why is it [they don't differentiate between targeted and opportunistic exploitation.] crucial for you to do so, given that this is very difficult to prove in any case?

Because we know enough from elsewhere to see a pattern and if this is different, as it is being presented, then it should be possible to demonstrate that with more than spinning the data.

&gt; Ultimately, you're making an unsubstantiated claim, contradicting the judgement of involved professionals, whose hypothesis on linkage factors is borne out by the evidence.

The claim isn't unsubstantiated, it is based on all similar case data obtained throughout the UK. The judgement of professionals isn't on display, the spin of professional spin doctors is. And the evidence doesn't differentiate in the way I've already mentioned, so it doesn't say what the report writers pretend it says.

&gt; Why is specific targeting of white girls a vital part of your narrative?

Because this is what we have seen everywhere else it has occurred and there is no evidence presented here to show otherwise despite your protestations to the contrary. But by attempting to spin the data as they have done it appears that West Midlands police are guilty of exactly what the victims elsewhere accused their police forces of. 

&gt; Why is CSE being solely committed by Pakistani Muslims a vital part of your narrative?

Not solely, but disproportionately. Because this is what we have seen happen consistently across the country and efforts made to hide or spin this do not serve the interests of the British people. Sometimes less is more. There is no pay gap, there is only a choice gap.Sometimes it comes off as stupidity that people still seem not to realise the argument was won decades ago.Men's rights started off as feminism striving for a more equal society. When society became more equal and feminists kept campaigning for women's advocacy despite women now having more rights and better lives than men, those who wanted equality began breaking away from feminism and formed what is now the men's rights movement. Feminists, who now owned the dominant social narrative, painted men's rights advocates as not striving for equality but trying to subvert the gains that women had made so that they wouldn't lose their power. Because of male disposability feminists were listened to and men's rights advocates are now considered the opposite of what they really are by those taken in by the dominant narrative.I haven't researched Birmingham particularly, but as I said previously - with the evidence presented thus far there is no reason to believe there is a significant difference from the other cities where this has been an issue.

And it IS selective data, six months instead of four years. Pretending otherwise doesn't make it so. 

I'm making assumptions based on wider data, not prejudice and I'm looking at what the data ACTUALLY shows, not what those interpreting it attempt to spin it as which is why I have pointed out that there is no differentiation between opportunistic and targeted exploitation in the data.

Vulnerability is indeed a key characterstic but that again doesn't tell us about targeting, only opportunism. We listen to the perps themselves, both in terms of what they admit, in what they've been caught saying with secret recordings and what we can infer from the efforts they have made vis a vis targeting. 

Whatever evidence is put forward I will add to the other evidence that exists and amend my conclusions accordingly. This data tell us about opportunism. Let's see what we can get from those who are found guilty about targeting. If that seems unreasonable to you, I'd suggest I'm not the one cherry picking, denying and spinning to fit a narrative.&gt; Well, I'm sitting in Birmingham at this very moment

My condolences ;-)

&gt; The work being done isn't solely by one agency

I do know how these things work and also the issues of cross-agency work, particularly agenda-driven cross-agency work, and they do try to cover their arses at least as much as they try to provide a full picture. 

&gt; Because they've done 5 problem profiles since 2009 - they aren't intended to be reviews of the entire period, as far as i can tell. They are updating the situation based on recent data.

Which is why the bigger picture looks different to the smaller picture.

&gt; If there isn't any statistical evidence that such targeting actually happens, the claims made post-arrest have to be taken with a healthy dose of salt.

They don't just come from claims made after arrest though, they come from surveillance when the perps don't realise they are being recorded.

&gt; As far as I have seen, victim availability is the overwhelming factor.

IIRC it isn't the overwhelming factor as victim availability was higher within their own communities but instead they sought out vulnerable young girls outside of their own communities with available victims in their own communities being disproportionately passed over.

&gt; if targeting rather than opportunism is affecting victim selection, this informs the threat profile as well.

Indeed, although as you've rightly pointed out previously both will inevitably be a factor here just as they have elsewhere, although if Birmingham is consistent with other places targeting by the perps will be racially based.If it can be spun as a hate crime then the usual suspects can get their 15 minutes of fame preaching about how racist the UK is. That depends, how brown is your skin?But it doesn't need to be repaid monthly and can even be delayed until the mortgage ends or you sell the property.Or rent it out completely and use the profit from that to get somewhere cheaper. Loads of options and it is their problem (and choice) what to do about it, not redditors who are ideologically opposed to help to buy.And are paying off the rest with a mortgage, same as many people that bought in the 00's.I think you give it too much credit.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8cUnlikely. Prices will have risen enough in the intervening period that anyone who has purchased now will still make a fortune even if the bottom drops out of the market like it did at the end of 2007. With ever increasing demand and ever limited supply affordability will just mean the internationally wealthy will be the only ones who can afford the nicest areas and everyone else will have to compete for less desirable areas if and when interest rates rise. But even when that happens, it seems unlikely that they will return to anything like historic averages.One trumps all of those reasons for not doing it - anger.

A woman scorned and all that.DNA evidence clearing people after the fact suggests that there have been a historically extremely high rate of False convictions for rape though. Nowadays it is he said she said and [even when a guy obtains consent and it can be shown that the consent was meaningful at the time it was given](http://chedevans.com/key-and-undisputed-facts) there is still a conviction. To me this is a False conviction but to the statistics it isn't.http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/html/cjusew96/cpp.cfm

Yes, you are wrong. Alpha attitudes don't make you alpha status either. Alpha status is simply being able to attract most women.

Apologies. I did check it worked before posting but they have since changed the url.Are you sure you posted this to the right person? &gt; Do you feel you have something more relevant to add other than your condescension to relevant anecdotes?

If you don't understand why this is a valid criticism then perhaps you should be posting at /r/feminism instead of here?

They *both* are. Surely you don't need me to explain to you that it happening to one person and not to another means that it does happen, not that it doesn't happen?

&gt; it's certainly more than you've managed to add to the thread other than deny the possibility that OP doesn't really understand boundaries and/or consent clues.

It's possible, but taking into account the reasons I've posted elsewhere in this thread it is extremely unlikely.

&gt; Reading through a few of your recent comments makes me realize that you're very close-minded and don't have the slightest grasp of sexual relationships/dynamics.

Makes me think of [this](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/19/mandy-rice-davies-profumo-model-dies).I doubt it was pegged as such in r/UK.

Hope you get your first choice.That isn't True. Attractive older women actually have a particularly difficult time of it because they can attract guys but can't get the commitment they want from the guys they can attract. They effectively price themselves out of the market and end up either sad and alone or resentful to the partner they do get because they aren't as impressive as the other guys they used to be able to date. So long as you arrange to meet at a restaurant, book a table and then stand her up. Yeah, it's not as if abolitionism, the civil rights movement, women's suffrage, etc. ever made any gains by being bitter and insulting those oppressing them. Oh, wait...&gt; Sometimes y'all seem bordering neckbeardy, like women owe you a date.

Having been subscribed here for more than two years now it still amazes me that there are people so completely unaware of the reality of the situation. It isn't about being owed a date, it is about not being hated, mocked, not taken seriously, discriminated against, etc. simply for a physical characteristic that no individual has control over. &gt; well you're ~~wrong~~ *a dick.*

FTFY.Interesting that you assume I would feel oppressed. Do you think everyone that posts on /r/short is short? Even more interesting that you've thought about this so little you haven't understood the problems associated with drawing attention to the oppression against people who are short. Have a think and see what you can come up with.Indeed, you seemed to be suggesting that short people were bitter, petulant, childish and insulting others for no reason, without understanding that the reality is very different. Again, think about why this might be and post your thoughts. If you are genuine you'll be commended or put right. There is a particular [Mark Hughes goal \(starts at 02:30\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivVhuFn0uns) that I put above the [Giggs v Arsenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quI_LkMj4HI), [Cantona v Liverpool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvEHz96zrnM) or [Beckham v Wimbledon goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udez65Q2Mig). The camera angle doesn't do it justice and you can't see how badly he is being held back by the two defenders, but he was literally stretching every sinew to get his toes to the ball. 

Younger fans should watch the whole thing to appreciate what a phenomenal player Sparky was. He never gets included on the greatest 11 lists but the man was absolutely brilliant.People with more empathy would say they were venting about the discrimination, hatred and unfairness they experience. People lacking empathy would say they were bitter and petulant without considering what they were bitter or petulant about.It is embarrassing (if disappointingly unsurprising) that even after having it explained to you you still don't seem to get it. 

The insults levelled aren't baseless, they are eerily accurate for those who come over to brigade another sub, mock the users, denigrate their experiences and otherwise (attempt to) troll (badly).

There are few educational materials because genuine oppression is hard to talk about without censure. Inspirational posts are made but being an oppressed group that isn't most people's experience. Resources? What resources do you think there are? Have you ever thought about attempting to see the situation from the other side instead of mouthing empty platitudes about things you obviously don't understand?It isn't *just* a prejudice. In fact it isn't *even* a prejudice, it's a presumption.Much as I am glad she spoke up, I agree that this needs saying - she's only defending the guy because she knows him personally and anyone else in the same situation she'd be part of the hate mob.Sexist! How *dare* you suggest that she doesn't rub her dick against your elbow just because she is a woman![I see what you did there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqJDuZIcQ34)I've told you that the supposedly shitty behavior is a response to worse behavior. You still seem to be glued to the notion that it is unprovoked and baseless when it evidently is not. You're even engaging in shitty behavior yourself by saying this is a place to "blame everyone else" instead of recognising that it is about calling out those who engage in the very behavior suers here are responding to including your own and without irony you don't even recognise that you are doing it *in spite of being told what it is in this very exchange*.

Calling people out for their bigotry may look like antagonism and hate to the bigot blind to their bigotry (whether wilfully or not), but it isn't.

Your overly-simplistic, naive and incorrect assumption that it is possible to have discussions about this issue with those who deny that such oppression even exists at a faith-based level is not about promoting empathy or not, it is about drawing attention to the lack of empathy. Intelligent observers are able to recognise the legitimacy of the grievances expressed here through simple objective analysis. 

Trolls are welcomed with hostility. Those interested in learning and discussing issues are engaged with. SRD and SRS are trolls. There may be exceptions for a handful of users at SRD but these are few and far between. It isn't calling newcomers slack jawed simpletons, it is calling those that come here from other subreddits to downvote brigade slack jawed simpletons. 

You not understanding that a response to shitty behavior being shitty behavior means the problem is the initial shitty behavior, not the response to it doesn't help your case.

You are supposed to look at what has provoked such accusations if you want to understand why they are being made.*This* is the problem you feel needs addressing?

[A *very* small percentage - 96%.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alison-denisco/dating-women-men-whos-taller_b_1527117.html)It was a news story about a specific political subject that also happens to be the most important political subject to most voters. It wasn't about policy, but it was about politics in that the UK is a draw for migrants to the extent that people are going to such lengths to prevent immigration. Whichever way you spin it this is a hot political topic.

So you're saying [this](http://i.imgur.com/K3yaOVu.jpg) is rape?[That isn't True.](http://newsok.com/female-prison-in-oklahoma-has-highest-rape-rate-in-u.s./article/3922988)&gt; Western intervention in the middle east has helped contribute to a lot of the problems in the middle east today.

This isn't actually as True as people seem to think it is. Western intervention in the Middle East has generally been about preventing things there from boiling over rather than aggravating them. Too many people seem not to understand this.No, only someone too partisan to understand what you are saying would think you were saying that Western intervention has had no influence on the Middle East. Saying that StW argues that Western intervention has the most influence or is the only influence is not the same as saying that Western influence has no effect. That's because they don't profess it, they just act according to it.From my post:

&gt; &gt; Western intervention in the Middle East has generally been about preventing things there from boiling over rather than aggravating them.

Ignore the point if you cannot address it, by al means.Basically that the Middle East has always been a boiling pot of inter-ethnic/religious/cultural tension and Anglosphere involvement has always been aimed at ensuring this doesn't spill over or only does so minimally. Weird that this has been downvoted, it is really interesting to see the views from over 20 years ago with the hindsight of what we know from today. It's out of self-interest rather than altruism, obviously. Instability isn't good for us, which is why we have let despots govern there even though they are inimical to our values. You don't have to be a genius to figure this out, so your effort to be sarcastically patronising doesn't reflect well on your intellectual abilities (or lack thereof). &gt; I have you tagged as 'mens rights prick' and from memory I remember you are terrible to discuss anything with, so I'm not going to spend ages talking to you.

I don't have you tagged at all, but am flattered that I made such an impact on you that you felt the need to tag me. I'm actually really good at engaging with intelligent minded people I disagree with as many regular posters here I'm sure will be happy to confirm and would suggest that the problem vis a vis engagement is you.

&gt; I think that western colonialism both historically and recently has helped contribute to the current state of affairs in the middle east. Given that dash formed in Iraq in the power vacuum following our invasion u think that statement holds weight.

&gt; You've taken a different view. We aren't going to agree, so what's the point?

The point is that your view is demonstrably misguided or disingenuous. The Middle East has a long history of inter-tribal/ethnic/religious/cultural/etc. conflict and the West's involvement has principally been to keep a lid on that so that there is sufficient stability to avoid internecine war at intra/inter state level. Honesty requires acknowledging that we are reluctant actors in the region with only bad choices and degrees of bad outcomes from our actions there. But honesty also requires acknowledging that were we not to be involved that the outcomes would be far worse as groups like IS came to power. I think you are right, those who aren't willing to acknowledge that they have made mistakes would rather hide from the truth than accept, learn and improve. &gt; which part of it is demonstrably misguided?

The part where the West is the cause of all the malaise in the region.

&gt; This is the same as your comment above - you're saying that it's a horrible place and it would explode without western intervention. Go on then, deomonstrate that to me.

What do you think IS is? 

&gt; I think it's actually much easier to demonstrate that the invasion of Iraq and subsequent shit storm has led to the current rise of Daesh.

I know you do, that was my point. The people involved in IS were always there and always had the beliefs they had. The West didn't create that, whether through military bases in the Gulf or the Iraq war. Hussein kept them in check though and when he was removed they rose to prominence. But whether he was removed by the West or not doesn't change the fact that IS existed before and after any Western intervention, and indeed have been around for almost 100 years following on from the original Muslim Brotherhood. Furthermore, removing Hussein was the right thing to do. He was playing a very dangerous game of brinksmanship with Iran and UNMOVIC as well as terrorising his own populace. 

&gt; You can't demonstrate your point, but I actually can demonstrate mine. All of the times where a dictator has been removed by western intervention we've managed to fuck it up and create a power vacuum which crazies then take over. Libya, Iraq and then attempted in Syria.

That doesn't demonstrate your point. That just indicates that you think leaving despots in power is always the right thing, but obviously you cannot think that. 

&gt; How can you support a government that knows so little about the region it has changed which side to support and bomb in two years?

What makes you think I support the government? And the situation has changed significantly over time from being essentially a civil war against Assad's own people to IS attempting to gain control of Syria. 

&gt; Just because you write things out nicely doesn't mean you're right. You've shown no single bit of evidence here other than your own arrogance

Interesting projection. Of course writing stuff out doesn't make it right, but what is written out can still be right. Explaining why something is so may not be providing 'evidence' in the sense you mean it but it can be equally or more valid if the logic is sound. Any history of the Middle East will confirm what I've said about the conflicts in the region pre-dating post WWII involvement from the West.Sane and sensible answers from Farage. UKIP are looking a better prospect than any of the other major parties on Europe whether you are a Eurosceptic of Europhile - renegotiation so that the EU suits the needs of *all* members can only ever be a good thing.No, but in a crowded subreddit? Sure!Particularly the away game against Juventus.The evidence we do have suggests [the opposite is True.](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2619922)There are others with probably [the Cornell](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/04/women-preferred-21-over-men-stem-faculty-positions) being the best known.

Regardless of how difficult you personally find it to believe, the entire notion of male disposability essentially makes it necessarily True - no one cares about men, but both sexes care about women. With the greatest of respect, I've given a quarter of a century to studying the differences between [the prejudices that women face](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/6958/Yeung_Amy.pdf?sequence=1) and [the prejudices that men face](http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/men-face-more-sexism-and-discrimination-than-women), and men bend over backwards to take women seriously even when it isn't warranted because of the [Women Are Wonderful Effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%9CWomen_are_wonderful%E2%80%9D_effect) which leads directly to the pro-female bias discussed above.If she presents herself as a bimbo, obviously not. If she presents herself as a professional, then they'll not just take her more seriously, they'll give her the benefit of the doubt they wouldn't to male colleagues and view her achievements more favorably than male colleagues too. There is zero pressure for women to be sexy in a professional environment and it is certainly not encouraged.

Breast implants aren't relevant unless they are excessive, in which case the person getting them shouldn't be taken seriously as they are displaying a lack of judgement.

And of course men have such issues to contend with! I can't believe the privilege you must have to even ask that question. And it is far, FAR *more* that men get judged than women but it is on height rather than slutty-dress-style.
Almost certainly a gendered issue. This was a domestic violence case and I can't imagine a woman being ignored for so many years if she complained of abuse. The law needs to be applied equally but that is simply not what happens in practice.

Our culture has moved on significantly from the 1950s in terms of attitudes to racism and women's rights, it's about time the same was applied to men.Cameron's use of 'inspired or directed' is woolly language designed to be deliberately vague whilst leaving him able to refute claims like Salmond's. Salmond should have known better than to fall for it and how it would be spun when he did. Donald Trump makes Nick Griffin look considered and statesmanlike. It is utterly ridiculous that he would be the nomination for presidency of the United States and he'd make Obama look like Reagan instead of Carter.

I'm pretty sure that most Corbyn supporters thought it was no secret...It's one thing if it is a representative of a group associated with violence, it is another thing entirely if it is a 12 year old you beat playing online Call of Duty.I'm not sure if you are seriously trying to extrapolate your experience on to every one else's who is short in the world or not? Most of the guys who are short and can't attract women aren't assholes at all, they are decent people who perhaps lack some confidence after being mocked about a physical characteristic they can't change that would be illegal if it were anything other than height. Or give a chance to vent and gain confidence as a result of shared experience without having their experiences denigrated by some naive guy who doesn't know them or what their life is like. Firstly, The Red Pill isn't about cultivating genuine and lasting relationships any more than Feminism is about making more effective use of of integers in problem solving. The Red Pill is about creating and maintaining attraction, both of which are necessary conditions for genuine and lasting relationships.

And whilst individual Red Pillers often spout off about things they don't fully understand in other threads and end up contributing to the trope that The Red Pill is 'bad', understanding the importance of confidence in attraction, particularly to guys that have been consistently rejected, mocked, shamed, etc. is of fundamental importance and you are objectively wrong both in how you label The Red Pill and in the lack of benefit you feel can be derived from it from guys who have been rejected because of their height. 

Addressing hypergamy *is* about confronting insecurities and body image issues. You say that "for every woman who cares, there's another who doesn't" but the [reality says otherwise with 96% of women caring](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alison-denisco/dating-women-men-whos-taller_b_1527117.html) about a potential partner's height.

50% of men are below average height and only 4% of women are prepared to consider such men. The Red Pill gives these men the tools they need to attain success with women outside of this 4%. Regardless of how you'd prefer the world to be, the reality is that many guys do need it simply because of the mathematics as looking in the right places leaves at least 46% of men partnerless.

I appreciate that there is no malice in your post and you don't deserve to be downvoted for genuinely trying to contribute but your naivety doesn't help anyone. The world simply is not how you would like it to be and guys who experience that are a far better judge than exceptions such as yourself as to what their chances are.&gt; wouldn't of
