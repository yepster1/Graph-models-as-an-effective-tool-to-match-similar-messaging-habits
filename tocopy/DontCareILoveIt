TY!

Wish I wasn't maxed out on my gold giving this week.

This is a very sweet post!An absolute collective agreement to **never** mention the name of the killer or show pictures of the murder in any public forum.

It may not be the *main* reason they do these mass shooting, but in their manifesto's and sucide messages they do mention other mass shooters and their fame.609 sheep refuse to jump over the fence - they are  tired of being stereotyped - and organize as a group.  

They boycott.

They hold rallies.

They riot in the streets

They loot.

They make banners.

They make signs.

They hold sit in's &amp; walk outs.

They go on the talk show circuit to drum up support for their cause.

They make bumper stickers.

They lobby congress to make laws to make stereotyping sheep illegal.  

Counting sheep is now a class A felony, punishable with 5 years in prison, and 10,000 fine.**Shark Tank**

Love, love, love that show.

You should watch it because on every episode you can learn at least one thing to do, and one thing not to do in starting or running a business.

Even if you never get into business for yourself, knowing these things can help you advise friends and/or family who start their own business.I can't pick just one - but I won't go crazy so here are two of my favorites:


This one - because it was **raining** gold - Oprah style, for over 24 hours.

[What's good in helping to boost your happiness?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3lgbi8/whats_good_in_helping_to_boost_your_happiness/)
.

.


This one - because there were over **50,000** posts in under 24 hours.

[What is a non-racist, non-sexist opinion you have that would make people dislike you? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3g4blw/what_is_a_nonracist_nonsexist_and_non_hateful/)That there is a huge difference between one person's "I'm depressed" and another person's "I have depression"Because it **can** get better, and you **can** get to a point in your life where you do enjoy it.

(happened for me!!)&gt; I don't really see it changing.

I can't tell you how many times I thought that.

One thing that helped me was a saying I made up, I put it on my bathroom mirror and ignored it for weeks... but one day I read it and decided to take a tiny step.  I continued to take tiny steps until eventually I could take slightly bigger ones and so on.

It can't hurt for you to give this a try - consider putting this saying on your mirror...

I WILL STRIVE

TO IMPROVE MY LIFE

ONE STEP AT A TIME

ONE STEP A DAY

WHAT WILL BE

MY STEP TODAY?

Good luck - and I swear it *is* possible that someday you will enjoy living and actually want to be alive.
It's only $4 bucks!  (2 bucks if you buy it in bulk) 

What's $4 bucks - when it comes to making someone's night?  
Having to pay thousands to replace everything you lost when the place you are renting burned down - because you didn't want to pay the $50 to $70 a *year* it would cost for renters insurance.Howdy!!!

So I've found out that Maniac_34 is secretly plotting to snipe **infinity**. We don't have much time - we need to plan a strategy to keep that from happening ASAP!

Any ideas?

In other news - I can save ya'all 100's of hours of looking through Reddit for the good stuff - I've found a thread that pretty much lists every great post in the past year or two.

Here's the link - enjoy!!!

And in other news - it's now a class A felony to count sheep!!!  


[Sheeps revolt](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3fzm7p/sheep_counting_thread/cvl4ols?context=3)


Count at your own risk - the FBI may be monitoring this thread!Don't know! Didn't even think there'd be anyone around at 3:00 am!##**&lt;Heavy sigh&gt;**


How am I ever gonna make one of these nifty lists here???

Wow! So you are listing my two threads as your favorite ones here?? You are **soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo** sweet!!

Might not be on any of the lists - but you just made my whole week!

**HUG**&gt; 482 000

##**CONGRATS!!**

Sheeeeeeeesh - watching you guys do this k was soooooo confusing!!! 

I think *everyone* including the /u/Tom_Hanks_ counted on this one!



##**CONGRATS!!!**

You've *made* it!! 

Hall of 999s here you come!Aww thanks!!

I like being the cheerleader here - I can do everything I need to do here in just an hour or two a day.

This morning was the first time I've missed upvoting the count in months! 

For some reason when I tried to load up the last several hours of counts this afternoon  - it would only let me go back three hours!

But ya'all were *very* verbose this k - was alot of fun to read it all LOL.  

**Fite! Fite! Fite!!!**

You are 

Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

sweet!!!!

##**CONGRATS!!!**

A very nice # *GET* in your first week! WTG!Mr. STAT-MAN,


Now that ya'all won't be getting a # like it for almost a million counts.. how hard would it be for you to pull the names of those who've gotten the folllowing:

123,456

234,567

345,678

456,789

We won't see a # like that again until

1,234,567  and then it'd be over a million more before the next one!

I think it'd be nice to have a list of those GET's and if possible the:

111,111

222,222

333,444

444,444

I know who got the 234,567 (atom) - after the infamous 200,000 record setting GET.

Don't worry about it if it'll take to much time - not sure anyone but me is interested in this stat.


Nice start!!! 

Since you are looking - it'd be nice to have the following as well:

100,100

200,200

300,300

400,400

FYI I know who got the 

##**420,420** count it!

King can you fix the table - I was mistaken about that get.

TYRE: How new threads in the infinity thread should be started

I've seen the disagreement here over the "old" way and the "new way - and I'd like to act as a bit of a mediator here since I've seen pretty much every word said on this subject...

take it or leave it

First I think RS's idea is logical and makes sense in regards to counting the 000 twice - once on the GET and once on the start of the new thread.|

But I think the reality is that you aren't really counting it twice - you count 411,000 once and you show a representation of that count when you start the next thread not "recounting" it. It's also not a reply to yourself because that'd require you to count 411,001.  

In any disagreement where a compromise can not be met - the *default* should always defer to the person(s) who don't agree to a change.

This is how it works in marriage and in business.  I was married for nine years and have had more than one business partner so I do know what has to happen when one person absolutely wants a change from the way things are to a new way and the other does not.


If this were a week long or month long project - making a change that's not unanomous might hold some weight. But this has been *ongoing* for over 3 years with over *480* cases of it being done one way - so to change such an extensive long term strategy should require an agreement by everyone to do so.

And I will say this - in *my* opinion the person who has put the most time and energy into a long term project such as this should have the most say in if there is to be a change or not (ie Atom). Unless *all* others have a very strong opinion that there be a change - it shouldn't happen.  

In other words - in this case I believe the status quo should be the default way things have always been done - unless Atom has some strong desire to change things.

I could go on - with more detail later if the reasons I've given are not enough.

So this is just my opinion as an unbiased observer who likes all of you.

**HUG**##**CONGRATS!!**

That was quite a run! 

Hats off to Farty - I saw what you did there!I'm loving this sub right now. 

I've been on Reddit over two years and ya'all in this sub are the only people who even know I exist!!

##**HUGS TO EVERYONE**BUCKY:

I can understand why you'd be upset/angry over getting banned for downvoting - but I want you to think about what you are doing.

Everyone I've met here are nice, sweet, kind and generous people.  What good does taking your revenge out on them do? Does it help you? Or make you feel better to take revenge out on people who have never done anything to you or been mean to you in any way?

Pretty much everyone here was really nice to you when you were an active counter, so doing things to disrupt or upset them doesn't seem right or fair.

Few here care about Karma - but it's the thought that counts - that you are taking out your frustration out on really nice people who've never done anything to you.

Just give that some thought!

WhitEnjoy the gold - hope things pick up for you hun!!

I'm glad you are turning your life around!!!

Enjoy your gold, be sure and stop by /r/lounge while you have it.

**HUG**&gt; Australia gun laws work and there are less gun deaths. There is no argument. You wanna push your twisted hard right world view go ahead but experience I nations like the US say your wrong.

I've been trying to just pass over the CONSTANT comparison between Australia and the US in this thread since it's 6 days old but I can't take it anymore.
While we are comparing the two countries and the potential effectivness of gun controls... please share with me how many millions of CARS, TRUCKS, SEMI's you have coming across your borders potentially carrying guns do you have? How many thousands of miles of unsecured borders do you have? And how many millions of unscreened visitors do you have?
Please expain to us how you have reduced the millions of vehicles from crossing your borders carrying drugs / guns / etc?
Since you think the two countries are comparable - how many millions of people live within a days drive of your country?
It seems we could have comparable success as Austrialia - once we get rid of the 300 million guns currently here... as long as we follow your lead on how you stopped the millions crossing your borders from bring in guns - like they do now with 1000's tons of drugs every year.
Thanks for the info - once you share this info - we can not only get rid of guns, we can get rid of drugs too!!!

While you are comparing the USA to Australia - and how your laws are applicable here - we currently have a problem with illegals coming across the border and 100's of them committing rape, murders etc.  Could you share with us what laws you passed to prevent illegals from crossing your borders?

Seriously - if you are going to compare how the laws in your country would apply here - you need to help us figure out how to stop the 1,000,000 cars, rv's, semi's from crossing our borders as you have in your country.  

Also once we secure our thousands of miles of borders as you have - we can make progress in preventing criminals from getting guns here.  So we just need to find out how you did it.  We've been having a problem with TONS of drugs crossing our borders for years, all we needed to do is find out how you solved the problem of having millions in border countries just a stones throw away.. 



Thanks for your insite!WoooHoooo you are on a roll lately!!!

**CONGRATS**Howdy!!!

I'm here - I've just been pondering if I should do my normal "Play by Play" this week.  

Those who were here for all the drama...were here.  Those who weren't probably would rather not have to hear about. Sooooooo ;)

I'll just say I'm glad rschaosid is still with us! 

And a big thank you to rschaosid for his "per k" participation charts - they are one of my absolute favorite parts of this sub ever!!! I love, love, love them!

I am thinking about contacting BBC (the ones who mentioned this sub before) and letting them know that we are about to hit the big **500,000** - just not sure if the sub wants a huge influx of people or not so haven't done it yet.


**HUG**

Whit


EDIT: I did send a email to the BBC to see if they want to do a followup article. However since it's looking like we may reach the big 500,000 Monday or Tuesdy. I may have waited to long (they need time to research articles). I'll update here in this comment if I hear back from them.I wasn't hear for the 200k but it was **HUGE** - check /u/atomicimploder history - sort by TOP and hit context to see the chaos.

200,000

That's over 2500 people who were here at that moment! 

I've been hyped for that for weeks now!

I'm planning to break from my self-imposed rules and make one count in the **499,000** thread!!! 

Sometimes rules are meant to be broken and this special occasion is one of them! We should take bets on this - it'd be fun.

I predict late 2017 but I am banking on a huge rush around the  950,000s and more participants for that event.I'm with you there!  Those thread participation charts make him in my top 3 favorite Redditors of all time!Well it's possible there will be a ton of newbies here (if it gets mentioned on BBC or whatever) but before then I'll grab that script that allows you to see replies without refreshing and I know the techniques that the newbies won't' know so I should be able to get one count in.

If it's just all the regs speed counting - I know ya'all will let me squeeze one in :)

SLACKER!!!!  You missed 29 counts!

Thanks again for the chart - love, love, love it!**OLD HOME WEEK**

Welcome back to all **OG** counters dropping in this week!!!!

---

FYI - I spent a great deal of time recently going through the list of some of the most active counters. I spent time looking at each one to see who may or may not be interested in seeing the big **500,000** 

About a dozen or so I thought would be interested based on some specific critiera - so I just sent them messages letting them know we are likely to hit it Monday or Tuesday.  

So expect to see a few old familiar faces soon!!

Whitney


P.S. so far 4 for 4 are going to be dropping in!!
&gt; I'm late chiming in on this, but the table could perhaps be a bit more complete by including things before 100k! Things like 33333, or 12345

Wow I am soooooooooooooooooooo bummed right now!!!! I spent like 6-8 hours going through the first 10,000 comments of this count to infinity.  Saving all the 'first" first quads, first mention of infinity, first this, first that, funniest comments etc.  Hours and hours I spent. 

Everything I saved is all GONE - except a couple posts!!

This is so frustrating - I can't believe Reddit's save feature is this f'd up! 

While only few would have been interested - I know they would have loved to see these things.

&lt;sigh&gt;

I'm going to post the few that Reddit decided to keep for me here now in the next Friday thread, and perhaps someday I'll take the time to recompile the list (saving it in another fashion obviously)


TL;DR - this post is only for those who like stats and interesting facts about this infinity count. Everyone else feel free to skip it.

---



A few months ago I spent many hours going through the first 10,000 posts on this count to infinity.  I saved everything I thought was notable, or really funny.  First mention of infinity, first deleted # (171), first mention of this being addicting, first this, first that. 

While I figured only a few would be as interested as I was - I knew there would be some interest.

However - it's ALL GONE! All those hours wasted, because apparently Reddit's save feature is totally f'd up. I'm very bummed about this, but obviously I should have backed up this work!

I'm going to share the few Reddit was kind enough to leave me with.  I've posted the links so you can just read them yourself, but I've also posted the comments themselves for those of you who don't wish to have to hit the links.


Hopefully a few of you will enjoy these.

They've been counting... day in and day out, week after week, month after month for years. 

Doesn't everyone?

They've counted over 490,000 times now. 

The sub was actually listed by the BBC as one of the top 5 oddest communities on the internet LOL. and MASHABLE listed the sub as "Your new favorite way to waste time" 

As long as the men in white coats don't come and take them all away before then - they should be hitting the 500,000 milestone Monday or Tuesday'ish



500,000 GET!!no + infinity

check that

&gt; I have just been reading in to this a bit, and it has been quite interesting. How long has this been an issue

Howdy!

It was an issue for a few weeks, but it's been totally resolved now, thank for your feedback!

**HUG**

Whitney

&gt; Karma, not the cosmic kind, the Reddit kind.

Karma is points on Reddit. You currently have 1413 Karma points.  If you want to check someones Karma, you can hold your mouse over their user name or click on their name and you'll find it at the top right on their profile page.

For some people having alot of Karma is important, some don't care one bit.   Having some karma is good in my opinion - over 1,000 points. But after  certain point (say 3,000) I don't think it really matters. I don't see any difference between someone with 3,000 points and 9,000 points. 

To get karma you post, people upvote it - you get karma points.   To get alot of karma - you just have to get lucky and post at the right time in a thread that ends up being really popular.  Doesn't really matter what you post, I've seen people type "Wat" and get 2,000 karma points.  I've seen many times someone type up a very extensive - well thought out post and get 1 karma point for all their effort.  It's pretty much a crap shoot.

To get some karma - sort by TOP past HOUR in Askreddit and hope to get lucky.

Hope this helps!

**HUG**&gt; I INSTANTLY (ie within a second or two) get 2-3 downvotes on the post.

I think this is because others have submitted their post and they want theirs to rise to the TOP or RISING, so they downvote the posts around their same time of submission - so theirs stands out and is at the top. I could be wrong.Howdy

Recently I went through the list of top counters of all time.  Based on some specific criteria I invited about 15 of them to come see us reach this significant milepost 500,000 that they helped achieve. So far 5 have RSVP'd and it looks like some are now monitoring this count (hence the 18 viewers here now) but many of the 15 may not have gotten my message yet.

I am just hoping that ya'all don't reach the 499,000 thread until more of them have had a chance to read the message and join in to see / participate in this.

I'm not trying to suggest ya'all stop the count and wait or anything.  I guess I just hope you don't go out-of-your way, to get there today, before more of them have a chance to get the message.

I've also sent emails to the BBC and MASHABLE in case they want to do followup articles - it's looking like they may not even have a chance to get the message before you guys get to the 500,000.

Anyhow - as I said - I'm not asking ya'all to stop the count or crawl with it... just hoping you don't go out of your way to race to it today.

**HUG**

Whitney&gt; Does it "do" anything? Like if I have more karma do my posts get more visibility? Btw, thanks

You are welcome.  No it doesn't "do" anything at all.  But some people judge you if you have really low karma (like under 1,000) - they think you aren't really active here, or are inexperienced with Reddit etc.  

The *only* time it really does anything is if you are in the much higher comment range (like perhaps over 50,000) then you may be looked upon differently by some.   IE as very experienced on Reddit, or a great contributor.  Also if you get into the extreme #'s (like over 200,000) then you start to get known by others and at a certain level you get listed as one of the top contributors.

Really in my opinion and I think others, there really is no difference between say 3,000 k and 9,000 k.  Or 12,000 k and 30,000 k.

Don't know how many of you will see this - but I just have to say ya'all are

##**AWESOME**

As most of you know I said I hoped you wouldn't go out of your way to get to the 500,000
yesterday (Saturday) - not only did you not go out of your way to get there.  You went way out of your way to *not* get there.  It was soooooooooooooooo sweet (and kinda funny how far people went) So sweet that ya'all still care about the old timers &amp; wanted to give them a chance to see this!

Since most of you don't see all that happens here - I'll give a few examples.  Several times yesterday there were 12-14 people here, and not *one* was counting in the main thread - several times there were many actively counting here but not one was counting in the main thread. In addition to that there were several here keeping side threads active and busy to intice others to join those thread and destract folks from the main thread. At the height of the 500,000 hype &amp; one of the biggest events in /r/counting history - twice yesterday there was an hour between counts!

I saw several other little ways people were working to keep things slow... you guys are amazing!
It kept reminding me of a NASCAR race with 12 pace cars holding the drivers back LOL.

8 of the 15ish old active counters have responded to my message re the 500,000 - a few of the others may not be interested, a few may end up missing it who would be and that's ok - don't think there's a way to have even all those who are current full time counters to all be here at once.

At any rate - thank you all, you are soooooo sweet!! I am thinking.. GAME ON - let the active counting resume. Psssssttttttt... rschaosid time to end your hiatus - thanks for your help with this hun!

Thank you!

**HUGS TO ALL OF YOU**

Whitneycongrats!

FYI: You have got to be the *laziest* thanker on the planet!!

&gt; A beer, probably.

It's a million bucks, go crazy, buy a whole 6 pack!&gt; BUNS

Damn! I wanted to GET this one... I won 'best BUNS on the beach' contest in Jamaica once!REPORT /u/bluesolid for comma abuse!!!Wiggle...

just checkin' out my new flair :)This table is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to complex for the layman...Too funny RS!!

I *think* I can understand that table!

&gt; going to sleep then school, please don't pass 500k guys

At the rate the counts been going today - I estimate 500k at November, 1st. (2019) Damn - you currently have **420** comment karma!!!

NOBODY UPVOTE SOS!!!

Kidding!&gt; Just turned in an atrocious paper and that still made me laugh. Thanks Whitney.

Aww your welcome hun! Glad you got that paper done and out of the way!

Waiting for this 500k has blown my "rules of how many hours online per day/week" completely out of the water!! Justifying it because this is a once in a lifetime event soooooooo... otherwise I'd have to stay offline for a month to make up for this LOL.

Seriously though - I haven't quite figured out why things are almost at a dead stop still - so many times there were 22-26 people here and no-one counting (at least not in the main thread).  Just not quite sure what to make of all this. LOL

I keep wondering if it's like "I don't want anyone to miss this ... so I'm not gonna count" being said by everyone? Just don't know what's going on - most hours there's like 5ish counts to the thread. Odd, Odd, Odd. 

Anyhow - hopefully we make the big 500,000 before 2019!!!  

&gt; I should be walking again in a few weeks!

Awesome!!

No one quite realizes just how long 3 months is - until you've spent it with a cast on one leg.  For me it was 6 months, because I was obsessed with nightclubs and dancing at the time, so I went out several times and danced in my cast... making my 3 times fractured knee cap swell up inside the cast.  As I think I mentioned, they ended up having to put me in a new cast at the end of the first cast.  The 2nd one they put on me was sooooooooooooo tight that I couldn't even squeeze the well known (you know!) coat hanger inside to scratch it.  It was that tight!  Trying to get from the couch to the bathroom in that 2nd cast hurt so bad... I had a scar for almost a decade from the 2nd cast as it rubbed against my ankle. (needless to say I had to go 3 months without dancing at that point!)

I should share the story as to how I ended up with that broken kneecap - haven't shared that story in years... it's a very interesting story perhaps I'll share it in the next FTF!!

rschaosid **[HIATUS OVER]**

finally!!!  

aaaaaaaaaaaand now my ETA for the 499k thread goes from 2019 to ~~20:19~~ minutes LOL! 

Well since you are both off to sleep - I am too.  Crossing fingers the 499k thread won't be done by morn... Night all!!


Thanks RS, still love, love, love these participation charts!!!

No new counters this thread or did you not denote them?

See you in the morn - crossing fingers that the 499k thread won't be over by the time we wake up!##**499,077**

WOOHOO!!

Hard to squeeze one in here LOL!

I made it!! 

Part of the big 500,000 final stretch!  

3+ years in the making...

EDIT: /u/zhige - yup, I'm the sub's cheerleader, not an active counter.  I explain why in the [TIDBITs](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cufa4se) thread.  But I've been waiting weeks now to participate in this final countdown!! I'm sooooo stoked that we'll be hitting the big **500,000** today!

EDIT 2: Thanks for the gold /u/zhige!!!&gt; Same, well at least I got 499,992.

I noticed you got gold for that 499,992!!!

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/gilded/&gt; Haha, I really like your flair. Not sure if it's new, but I've just noticed.

Thank you! 

Yup it's new!!! I liked being referred to as the sub's cheerleader so decided to make it my flair since last night!Well if yesterday was any indication - you could have missed school today for nothing. 

I keep thinking to myself though - about them racing through that... even if they had taken the whole day to count that k. Likely someone would have missed it.

With so many counters here, I don't think there's any way to really plan it out so nobody misses it.

But I think when we get to the 1,000,000 I might make a schedule where everyone (who's been actively counting in the past month) can list when they *can't* be here... see if it's possible to find a time where everyone can be here for it.

Because 500k is big... but 1,000,000 - I don't think anyone will want to miss it.

So we can see if we can find a time when everyone can be here (it's possible).

I know what you mean - I had to sleep last night but woke up like 4 times to check to make sure they hadn't started racing to the 500k and I'd miss it.  Was really hard to sleep! 

There's a ton of time - I'll work out a plan like I mentioned so nobody has to feel this way for the 1,000,000. Unsure if we can do it but I think it's possible...kinda like company vacation schedules work.What about me????

&lt;pout&gt;Awwwwww

Congrats!!! You were the only new counter who was able to get a working # in the chaos that was the race to 500,000!!

Your name will be forever in the record books in the 499,000 thread!

I was expecting it to be you from the start!

You should change your flair now to World Class sniper.

You probably have the **1,000,000** typed in for the snipe eh?

##**WELCOME VISITORS!!**

this count to infinity started on June 10th 2012 and has been ongoing now for over 3 years, with over 7,000 counters. 

Here's a link to where it all started if you are interested...

I was working on fixing that link to the actual start of the count as you were typing that LOL.

They've been counting to infinity - not quite there yet but the big **500,000** is finally here after over three years of counting.  This count started on June 10th 2012!##**CONGRATS**

Your first assist!  You should add it to your flair!

**HUG**

Pssssssssst - We got one hooked I think folks!!!!Thanks RS!

Looks like 29 new counters in this thread!!

Wow!No bots allows if that's what you are asking.  Many here have counted thousands of times so they have their techniques down pat.   It's pretty hectic here today as you can imagine.  Most the time it's not so hard to get a count-in-edge-wise.

You can learn the techniques from the TIDBITS thread if you are interested.

Also - there's actually a thread counting throwaway accounts.  You should check that one out sometime :)

How in the fu*k does it effect those who aren't even HERE.Moo - I've seen just about every side thread here run - why should this one be different - there was never any sort of intention that people not be allowed to run in this thread - there is no reason us running for a while is going to effect those who come in later and count the way they want.
&gt; 3167 sheep counting sheep however the fu*k they want to. &gt; 3169 SHEEP tired of people trying to impose what THEY want on others.&gt; 3171 sheep just going to count sheep as the creator of this thread intended.

Others can count sheep however they want too.Moo there is NO reason this thread should be throttled 24/7 just because a handful of people want to use the count itself to carry on a conversation - there is NO other thread where just a handful of people expect the entire rest of the people her to do it their way... 

there is no reason for them to demand full control over this thread when they are not even HERE!

This thread was created to count sheep - when they want to count sheep while having a conversation thats fine - but that doesn't mean they have the right to demand everyone else here have to have personal conversation and share their lives and so on in this thread

SOME PEOPLE ARE HERE JUST TO COUNT Because this thread is counting UP by 1 as it always has been. 

I have no idea what decimal even is  and as far as I know infinity +n aren't allowed here.

The mods decided this thread should be allowed - if you check the first 400 counts it was basically the same as the main thread with the word "sheep over the fence" added.  

There's no reason second guess the decisions of the mods of a thread they've allowed for months and several thousand counts?


Anyhow - I'd like to start a thread where we count up by 9 to reach 999,999,999 but I'm unsure if that's allowed here yet....

till then this is the ONLY thing close to the main thread - don't think a handful of people should be able to hi-jack this thread 24/7 for the 2-4 hours a day they use this thread.

Running what? 

Me and throwthrow were the only ones here and we were counting... 

if you have a problem with that...that's not my concern


Have a nice day.

3181 sheep who think people who have issues with people COUNTING in any thread in a sub called 

#/r/counting

need to get a grip.You are now lying.

You are now obviously joking
Check my reply times - if I got one in - under 10 seconds then I'll apologies for saying you are lying.. many of my reply times were 15-40 seconds you can't tell my you never managed to get one count in th entire time...

By the way RUNNING does not mean counting 30-60 times in a 1,000 count thread - you have some serious control issues

don't tell us we can't fucking count 40-80 out of 1,000chance in case someone who can't even beat me - the slowest person in this sub... may not be able to get a count in for a bit.No you told me there can only be one thread here that is counting to infinity.

The thread idea I have is counting only to 999,999,999 by 9's :)

But I'm going to be busy so not too worried about starting it anytime soon.

I am not trolling - I am making a point that just a couple of people should not expect an entire thead to be locked down 24/7 for the hour here  and hour there they count.

This sub is about counting - this thread was made to count.. I am now being accused of "running" this thread with my 25 or so counts because my 20-30 second reply times prevented others from being able to count and I am the TROLL??


Moo - I am NOT the troll here - shiz is bitching and saying we are RUNNING this thread and that he wasn't able to get a count in here.... 

I counted 29 times in an hour... I was NOT RUNNING
Skiz!!!

I counted 29 times in over an HOUR period of time - many of my counts were over 30 second - there is no fucking way 29 counts in an hour is running a thread and their is NO way you couldn't get a fucking count in the entire time.

I don't appreciate you lying and implying that I was somehow keeping you from getting a count in - you KNOW that is not True. 
I didn't really see that other guy - he only counted maybe 3 or 4 times the entire  hour... don't think a few back to back 10 second replies really prevented you from being able to count here...

really you are blowing things completley out of hand... 

me and throwthrow were counting here rather leiusurely - not one time did I ever see you try to get a count in and fail...

anyhow counting 29-99 counts in a 1,000 count thread is NOT A RUN.

NOT A  RUN.
Shiz - if you are ever trying to get a count in here while I am COUNTING here in this thread and you can't beat my 20-30 second reply times just PM me I'll take a break and come back a bit later.


Using the word RUN or RUNNING in a derogitory manner is (in my opionion) about locking down a thread for an extended period of time for all but the fastest counters....

That didn't happen here - I think that anytime I am able to get a count in on a consistant basis it is NOT a run.. becaues I can't lockout 5 year old with an abacus from being able to count with me and whoever else is counting...

he's just trying to chase everyone else out of **his** thread.
Moo - I don't know what you are reading here but my post was in reply to him continuing to HARRASS one of those who's been counting here since day one!!

I have a RIGHT to be hostile when someone here is being hostile to one of our counters on a continuous basis.


sorry but you clearly haven't read the entire thing based on what you are saying I am NOT the instigator he is and he's going out of his way  to continue it by making shit up now and lying. Saying he couldn't get a count in here while **I** was counting how more obvious that he's doing anything he can to create drama here... so we will leave HIS thread.

Anyhow until you read the entire convo and all of his rude and hostile comments to throwthrow for COUNTING in a COUNTING thread in a COUNTING subreddit 


No you obviously missed him harrasing throwthrow after that... and then making shit up and lying...but I am the troll....

anyhow I'm done with this thread for today but  he is NOT going to drive me away from this thread no matter how much drama he tries to create or how many lies and bullshit he tries to pin on me - me fucking keeping him from being able to count and **I** am the troll... okdokie..

I'll be back here to count SHEEP tommorow

&gt; until you started posting your taunts creating a hostile atmosphere in this once peaceful thread.

2957 sheep that better not run this thread to the get.

This is what started the drama... and it's progress from there... 

but feel free to put ALL the blame on me while not saying a single thing about his harrasing  - his lying - his making shit up about me - his accusing me of running the thread with my 29 counts in an hour... him claiming my 20-30 second replies completely blocked him from being able to count...

maybe you should gild him... he's the saint here and this entire thing started with me - not him being upset because throwthrow was trying for this get...

carry on...blame me for everything... 


he should be able to post comment after comment like these on someone who's been a part of this thread since day one and I am the problem when I do the same type of negative posting back...

3067 sheep who see that you don't want this thread to allow creativity, and are upset by that.


3063 sheep wishing you would give others more time to post creative comments to make this thread more fun, than posting very quick replies...


3055 sheep wishing there were more creative sheep

3069 sheep done counting with throw because he hates creativity and fun




Unless I'm banned I will count in this thread..


If any mod does see this thread sometime (doubt it there's been two runs already today) they are going to believe from your comments - that I am the one causing this... 

The day my .32 interent can actually block someone else from being able to get even one count in an hour... is the day I'll start believing in Y2K again.


soooo anyhow - this "once peaceful thread" has had drama before - if anyone would know it'd be me#&gt; Nice to see how much of a hypocrit you are. You got mad at me for not wanting him to count how he was, and now you're running it to disallow people to make creative responses.


Running what?
Me and throwthrow were the only ones here and we were counting...
if you have a problem with that...that's not my concern
Have a nice day.


#&lt;Uhm...running the thread. I was trying to participate, but being on mobile, I had no chance.

ppppsssst - I think just about everyone on this sub knows my .88 speed is so slow the only way I can get a count in is for them to literally STOP counting for me..so unfortunte for you you are caught in a blatant lie - because you didn't realize that I can't possibly keep someone from being able to participate.  Had you actually BEEN here instead of lying an saying you were you'd know that. 



Just in case anyone sees this convo and me getting chastised and blamed for everything that's gone on 

I count 29 times in an hour and when I get mad that he lied about me and said I was keeping him from being about to count here he says I am destroying the thread...

#&gt;Have fun destroying what many of us thought was a fun thread.

How am I being blamed when he is saying shit like this just because of me counting here for an hour - that's destroying the thread??? I'm just supposed to ignore comments like these or I am the one being a troll?

I don't think I should have to let someone lie about me and blame me for things and suggest I am destroying the thread by doing 29 fucking counts here - if me defending myself is causing drama I can't see that I am the only one to blame... 



THIS is the kind of comments I am getting...after counting 29 times in an hour on a .88 baud speed... that's not even 1 every two minutes - but yet he's calling me names.... saying I was preventing him from being able to count... saying I was disallowing him from being able to make creative responses....

there is not a chance in hell 29 counts is a run and there's not a chance in hell that I was preventing him from running...I am NOT the one harrassing other users and saying snide remarks about them with their "creative" counting.. this all started with the run up to a get.... that's what's REALLY behind this no matter how much someone wants to try and pin all this on me because he's saying shit like the above comment to try and drive me from this sub... and harrassing throwthrow so he can maintain his precious #2 contributor here... 

NOT ONCE did I see a failed attempt in a count during the entire 29 counts by shiz then he comes in later and starts harrasing me for RUNNING - and yet I"m being blamed for causing this?

sigh...

dont care he's NOT gonna drive me away from his precious thread no matter how hard he tries to make shit up and cause drama so I can get blamed for it.

EDIT: This drama was not caused by me it started over some precious get and then esculated with shiz blatantly lying about me.

THIS IS NOT the only thread he's trying to control - see his comments regarding people counting without resistance in that other thread - he's caused drama over that too. He doesn't want people to be able to "run" that thread because nobody happens to be around counting in the other direction. Am I responsible for that as well?Misinformed about what??? 

You said: Also, I have not been lying, I've more or less been misinformed, or incorrect.

Now you are lying about lying! 

You said: Uhm...running the thread. I was trying to participate, but being on mobile, I had no chance.

That is a lie and you know it - now you are saying you were not lying.. which is a lie.

You called me a hypocrit and said you were not able to get a count in and that I was preventing you from making your creative comments... why did you say that???

Quite frankly I don't even think you were HERE at all at the time that I was "RUNNING" my 29 counts at about 1 count every 30 seconds with a bunch of 1 minute gaps... you just came back and lashed out at me .... and accused me of shit for no reason...


Hey /u/Mooraell 

&gt;&gt;I was saying that because username was going off for the night, and we were hoping the **thread would still be around to finish the count in the morning**.



remember how I left the thread in hopes that pixel might find the palidrome... he left this thread just shy of the get saying:

2957 sheep that better not run this thread to the get

anyhow - implying nobody should "run" 43 numbers? come on...

how can you not see this is not one sided here... I was talked to for making it appear someone shouldn't try for the palidrome.


43 NUMBERS is not a run and implying everyone should wait over night to count that many numbers... is what's causing the drama here...

running has always been a part of this sub - things will settle down when shiz learns that he can not stop everyone else here from being able to count in a counting thread in a counting sub 

counting 43 numbers in a 1,000 numbers is NOT A RUN shiz!! 


EDIT: If we just let everyone count here the way they want none of this drama would even be happening... except the drama around the precious GETs.No the DRAMA started when you decided that his counts should NOT count because he was COUNTING sheep in a COUNTING thread in a COUNTING subreddit.... and it esculated from there...

He's a realy nice guy and he's been counting in this thread since the hour it first started months ago - and you were being rude - and having a MEETING about making it so his counts would no longer count here - I stepped in to defend him and that's how this started... YOU had no right to decide if his counts in a counting thread in a counting sub should count. Period.



At any rate this RUN you claim to have been blocked from counting from and being able to add your creative comments in... consisted of 8 counts from that "other guy" **8** counts - he did a total of 12 counts the entire hour... 

anyhow - stop lying and stop making shit up and stop accusing me of shit that isn't True and stop trying to control this sub to an extreme extent ... 



You and anyone you are counting with can carry on a converstation while you count when you are counting in this sub... it happens ALL the time here - even in the main therad when it's not busy.

Pretty much every count I've done on here I'm conversing while counting...

#THANK YOU!!!

You are a saint!

Having the GET winners name bolded will be very  useful!! 

**HUG**3197 sheep showing off their BLAZING .32 mbps internet speed.

I don't know what that means it was .88 the last time I checked Evo said his is 100X faster than that .88 - so does that mean he's 200X faster than the .32? LOL

psssst you can get some incite into my messy toolbar as well LOL.3207

&gt; 3203 sheep who are actually faster than dial up (I think?)

&gt; 3199 sheep still using dial up

&gt; OMG - I wonder how much faster my .32 is than 56 baud from the 80s?

Howdy EVO! 

Check this out - my current internet speed... (you can see my messy toolbar too)

http://imgur.com/H5rINCY

I'm curious you said you were 100X faster than my .88 - how much faster are you than my current .32? 

(I do not know mathy stuff!!)

I'd like to get at least one count in this thread unless you are trying for a perfect 500 or a record speed. 

The only way I can get one in is if you guys literally stop counting for a minute though...

THANKS guys - wanted to get one more count in before things heat up...:)


**HUG**

Whitney

EDIT: EVO says his speed is 187X faster than me.

Now I want to know how much faster my .32 is from my old 56 baud modem... 

/u/rschaosid any idea .32 mbps vs. 56 baud? seriously I beat someone??? LOL!Well you are fast but you should see river (rideride) stats on 1 second replies - somewhere around 149?

how long has it been since your last k - 450,000's??Thank you!

I can tell you've been gone a while... since my haitus - my cheerleading tools have evolved LOL

The one I gave ATOM for his **50ks** got gilded!


See my new flair - it's no biggy but I'm gonna try for that number whenever they aren't trying for a perfect 500 or a speed run.  I picked that number so it doesn't effect someones long term goals for odds or evens. 

It's fine if I don't get a number in for every thread though - these guys have already gone far enough out of their way... to last this sub a lifetime! :)


Ok so than that gives me a clue how fast I am.

I think it's time to look into a faster option. :)

Thanks hun!

Howdy thank you for getting into the stat business we love stats!!


what we REALLY REALLY need is a way to pull out ALL comments that are NOT just a 6 digit number..

(so we can read all the conversations - imporant happenings - things like this chart etc...

is there any way you could work on that project... me and others really really want that.Or another idea I have that wouldn't be duplicating efforts is to indicate with a ? X or something anyone who got a 2 second reply time in the thread...It might be difficult but it's something that'd be amazing and really really valuable to this sub - for example whenever there are back-to-back runs (which I suspect to see a number of soon)

then anything said is lost forever unless someone were insane and hit "continue this thread" through hundreds and hundres of posts...

if you can do this I can make it look like this:


http://sidethreaddocs.com/sheep-1-2142Soooo if you help some of these guys get their grove-runnin back you are 20 days away from

#TOP 10!!

(est of 300 counts per run a day)Well I imagine so - that was the max amount time not the minimum 

Without any b2b2b runs you should still make it in 12-14 days with 300 or more counts per thread.&gt; Idk if she'd want to, but maybe /u/dontcareIloveit[1] would want to count with you

LOL - no no no - the only time I count here is when there's nobody around... it's painfully slow to count with me - I am where I want to be on the TOP 200 I'm fine. :)

Just gonna keep an eye out for 369's when ya'all aren't trying for a perfct 500 or a record breaker.

I picked this # for two reasons - it won't really hurt someone getting off their evens or odds - plenty of time to adust..

and cause I think 3 - 6  - 9 is cool *and* because I've loved 69's forever LOL.

just gonna try and get too 9 69's by friday (2 more) then I'll give my 369's a rest for a while.. :)


Quite frankly I have NO idea what you are even talking about???

What changes? Them being civil to throwthrow who's been counting since this entire count started?

Or me not being attacked and lied about when 'm counting 29 times in an hour?  

How the heck am I hijacking a thread?

Here's a screenshot of my bandwidth...

apparently 187X slower than EVO and RS... how am I possibly going to hijack a thread?

http://imgur.com/H5rINCY

I'm not trying to bring about any changes except to be able to count here! and I will.

Only way I'm not getting my 30 counts in here a day in - is if I am banned from the sub.

apologies for that momentary - sheesh- that I deleted 10 seconds later it was disrespectful - You know I've seen you say this around 5 times lately and not one of those times did you have any downvotes.. you were even with the others... so there must be some glitch in your systemLike I said he must have a glitch in his system because whenever he says that he has 3 just like everyone else or 4 or whatever the current number of people voting...

I've never seen any of those times where his votes were less than anyone elses..

I'm just pointing this out because other than a few days in the summer there really isn't downvoting going on here.

Since he seems to be worried about it just letting him know he's likely got a glitchHowdy hun!!

Welcome back!!

The guy on evens right now doesn't want the k sooooo if you are around maybe you can try for it? :)

It'd be nice to see your name in this 100,000's GETs LOLWell I don't know how fast you are but if you aren't really fast you'll probably just get frustrated if you try to get all the way there from here... just watch these crazies go until you know 960 or something anyhow while you are waiting the little while to get there check out the tidbits thread and add your tidbits I'd be honored to have "the 100,000 guy" in the thread!!

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cwk5d40

But don't stay gone to that thread too long these guys will be getting to the 960+ in no time! 10 min?

If you get the k you can add it to your TIDBITsCongrats!

You should go for quads every k (when they aren't trying for a perfect 500)

That'd be something you could get to #1 in I bet :)Is there a chart for this? I don't remember... most of the ones I remember are in the Hall of Gold have you seen that lately? Like 65 gildings in a month LOL 

It's on the sidebar..

ask rs to make a chart for this if there isn't one I know he'd be happy to make one for ya just summon him and he'll que it.627,854

Guys HOLD UP!! 

#HOLD EVERYTHING!!!

/u/Secres (the guy who counted the first 6 digit # in this count 100,000) 

deleted his 627824

We are going to have to start ALL OVER Now - maybe he can GET the 100,000 again.

I will start this count - since Z3F isn't around

**1**Howdy - you were 80 counts shy of TOP 300 when you started counting here today.. TOP 300 isn't major but at least people like me will see your name now and then.. not even I scroll those below the TOP 300 :)

I actually made it to the TOP 200! :)

I love having you guys here you are kinda special to me :)

Talked to the daggonit a few times (**2**) you should see our convo in the TIDBITS thread it's funny :)
#OMG I just realized how priceless if the

**100,000** guy 

were sniped by the

**200,000** guy

/u/atomicimploder 

PLEASE BE AROUND!!

THIS WOULD BE LEGENDARY!!

I'd /bestof THAT I could sell TICKETS to see you get sniped by atom!!!!!!!!Sorry hun but - if atom snipes this it's gonna be one of THE biggest things to ever happen here!

Definately bestof material!!#CONGRATS!!!!

I'll let you know when I get your congrats ready it's gonna require something very special!!

I still want to see the **200,000k guy** snipe the **100,000k guy** but it has to come organically to get it /bestof'd - hopefully I'll be to see it if it ever happens.

It's gonna be great to see your name every time I scroll the Hall of Fame as I probably do 10 times a week :)please please please ad your TIDBITs!! :)

This is awesome!

/u/secresYup I swear it would be big - but you know it can't be contrived to get /bestof'd ... so I sooooooo hope he sneaks in if you try for another k here sometime!NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I can't wait that long to see if the 200,000 guy snipes the 100,000 guy!!

Besides that 1 mill is going to who'ver happens to get their 2 second reply in fraction of a fraction of a 2nd sooner.... unless river or rs or box can pull out a 1 second'erIs it possible to indicate this GET was made by the 100,000 guy??? I mean it's not every day the first person in the HISTORY of this count to ever count a 6 digit # gets a k here 580,000 6 digits number later... so I'd love to see that indicated anytime anyone sees this CHART

Just a side note on the bottom

GET by the 100,000 guy https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3olp9s/499k_counting_thread/cvyer7c?sort=top

check out the 500k!!! Check the gold train it's hilarious (gotta scroll to see it all)Thank you I am going to be adding notes on each thread later but this is one of the bigger moments ever in this 3 1/2 year count so I wanted it you know front and center!


Here's the index I'm going to be making - every thread will have it's story told...


https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cxsffh0Well it's already gonna be newsworthy - likely featured by the BBC again - but if the 

**100,000** guy gets the **1,000,000** that'd be even bigger news...

however two guys who get alot of 1 second replies (150+ each) will I am sure be gunning for it I'm sure so - basically the only way anyone else will get it is if it's a fluke (but those 1second flukes are not that rare here soooooooo)Well you should still try - chances are slim but you could get it and that would be one of the biggest events ever here if you get it....

the 500k was won with a 4 second reply and there were a ton here! (no idea still how that happend LOL)You could I mean if it happened then it's certainly not impossible a 3 sec reply might get it.

Hell I might even find someone with a real internet connection and try for THAT one LOL!

I've got you marked to notify you 2 weeks before - in case you aren't keeping an eye on this sub - the speeds gone way up these days so it won't be a ton later.

If you don't do my tidbit thread ... I'm gonna stalk you .... 

pssst you are out of milk!!

Take care hun - this was alot of fun!!

**HuG**

WhitneyBy the way - the big-guns aren't sniping first k's anymore soooo if you'd like to get your first k - add 0ks to your flair...it's been over 300,000 since your first count here so you are long overdue!

Take care!~~6:30:31~~

you might want to put that number on that post above on top of the conversation we have alot of stat guys here and I think that might break their entire system :) 

^^^^KIDDING628,063

This is so weird... I'm not used to this - seeing the same two people chatting  in two DIFFERENT threads LOL.

Happy counting - I'll be back to try for the 369

Nice to meetcha Olakola!

If you get some time check out the Hall of Gold on the sidebar it's something to behold!!!Oh!!!! 

Awesome! 

Tell your story (100,000 guy) in the New Member Mixer on Monday and you just might become a perminant member of the MegaLounges along with a bunch of us counters :)

If you check the Hall of Gold over there ---&gt;

You'll see they are used to seeing /r/counting counters in the Lounge LOL628,077

Decision was made to keep it there - a little sub like this with over 60 gildings in a month... is something to be proud of... people who've never been gilded aren't likely to click "gilded" at the top of some sub...

I didn't even know that feature exsisted and I'd been on here almost two years!

I"d just like to mention - where it's at now ------&gt;

you can click on it from anywhere in this sub... from this convo or any - can you click on that obscure "gilded" option in this sub from here?

You can't - basically the only way anyone would think to check that in a sub would be if they themselves happened to get gilded... 

When that discussion was had about removing it - I was a LEVEL III gilder...

My career as gilder began the day they decided since two of the most frequent gilders rs and me wanted it to stay where it's always been...

I have many many reasons for gilding here - and would still do so even if nobody ever saw those gildings again.... but if you take a look at many of those last 60+ gildings.. many many have something signficant about them that will be useful to see over time.


&lt;-- a few gildings shy of GILDER LEVEL VI!!!

Less than 600 out of the 500,000,000 on REDDIT can say that.

I may be bragging but I think it's something to be proud of.

So I don't really want these so obscure that you have to go out of your way to find them - it's nice that anywhere you are in this sub at any time you can see your gildings and others :)

I'm gonna like this guy!!!!!!

I know the feels...

btw you are out of milk..&gt; storytime

When I was new and lurking here I couldn't figure out WHY the heck they counted day in and day out 24/7 for weeks, months, years so I started a thread to find out why...

river ( /u/rideride ) was one of the first to talk to me here ever... and I thought his name was riverride.. so I called him river then, and since then... months later someone asked why I called him that... and suddenly I realized his name was rideride not riverride... but by then it caught on and gradually over time more and more have started calling him that so it's one of the many many sub "thingies"

Here's a link if you would like to learn my theories back then... LOL

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/35ge26/just_why/LOL I'm 10 minutes behind you guys... I've already posted the river story above..

this reminds me so much of the old IRC SERVER SPLITS where you'd see a conversation happening but they couldn't see you.I drank it while you've been busy counting....&gt; youre slacking behind!!

LOL I know - I usually go back later and read convo's like this one that I want to read... but they are doing alot of "runs" lately so these get lost after a run.... don't want to miss this one!Haha first time anyones ever noted the signficance of THIS name!!!#I'll BUY YOU MORE!!

This is so funny I was already behind 10 minutes and then my net freezes for 10 sooooo.... :)06:33:10

Tried to gild one of your earlier comments but I spent my last dime on the **100,000** guy - his first gold since that historical day in this subs history - that's made me happy!!

I'll get it done later :)#6:**33:33**


##**FIRST QUADS EVER!!!!**

Want this convo in the thread since we were apparenlty "in the wrong chain LOL sooo......

Tried to gild one of your earlier comments but I spent my last dime on the **100,000** guy - his first gold since that historical day in this subs history - that's made me happy!!

I'll get your comment hooked up later :)

Well you make this counting fun!!

See you at the 369 if my net will allow it!

**HUG**

Whitney

SEE I told you /u/TheNitromeFan 

you can't trust anyone these days!!!

I think he's still mad that I drank all his milk!!Awww sweet that you were thinkin' of me :)

My net usual runs fine 24/6 (albeit 187X slower than you guys) 

but for some reason the last two hours - it only works for a few minutes here and there... :)

There are a lifetime of these 369... so if I miss em I do... I just put this in my fliar so if I'm around maybe you guys can pause for 1 minute 4 me... but I'm not gonna worry if I miss a some... there are 372 369's coming up before the 1,000,000!


but I loved the shoutout! 

**HUG**

Whitney

going to buy some milk for the new guy... I drank all his milk.So you remember those done after 2:00 were the ones that were just total jokes that we in no way wanted an answer too?

are you planning to answer all these ones?

I mean you can if you are trying to be funny but um I just shot out random numbers here... with the most odd request I could think of LOL.

But answer it if you want too!

3216 sheep hoping to get her 30 counts in today without my 100X slower speed preventing anyone else from counting... I just wanna count.

howdy hun! :)Three thousand, two hundred and nineteen sheep over the fence looking for

/u/counter45 - you are now jumping over fences!!!!Three thousand, two hundred and twenty seven sheep who aren't...

Bucky...because I WANT TO DO IT - I have the post picked out and everything... 

I have been using paypal forever but I got a virus so I had to cancel that...  so now I'm using prepaid visas... I used the last one on the **100,000** guy earlier. So I have to wait till tommorow..

I'm just giving them the heads up cause they do alot of gilding here too - sheesh I couldn't even get rs to STOP gilding me for a while!! LOL :)

~~Hun this guy is awesome - I want to be the one to give him his first gold... there's a perfect comment to do it.. but I have to wait till tommorow :)~~


~~He's waited **3** years and 8 days... he can wait one more LOL.~~

oh well moving on...

:)#CONGRATS!! - GOLD 3 YEARS IN THE MAKING!!

I'll get over not being able to be the one to give it to you... I tried...

Be sure and drop in /r/lounge on monday.. 


Here's the comment I was wanting to break your gild-innocence with.. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3w76n3/628k_counting_thread/cxtysdv



Well if it was anon then that means the person doesn't want you to know for whatever reason....

there have been arond 70 gildings here in the past month...so it could be anyone...

I have my suspicions though...but we all totally respect each others right to be anon...

Its all good... loved that comment - and loved that you were the first person in my history with this name to ever note it :)

**HUG**

At least you know *I* wanted to give you your first gold ever.. I'm fine with someone else being the one to do it!


See the post above yours that starts with 

Just a hint...

It has no upvotes... I've made several comments to you that don't have them... so there's no way to know if you've seen them

I'm just saying these kind of "side" comments - or posted later comments are frequent...

and normally we when we read them later we give em an upvote... that lest the person know there's a good chance you've read them.

Anyhow if you don't understand no worries - you'll figure things out here as you go

*nite

Well I have the HoC 10k on PINNED I've probably ctrl + F it 1,000 times LOL

but as far as getting to know the names - basically I don't have a clue who's in the 368 - 4921 range :)

But I see those moving up the ranks so get to know the names of those in the TOP 300 and sometimes recognize em when they drop in

anyhow now that he's been back I think people will remember his name more :)

I am sooooooo wanting atom to snipe him it would be fucking legendary - in my opinion in the TOP 20 moments of all time here... (maybe even 10

**200,000** k guy snipes

**100,000** k guy!! 

/bestof for sure!That's an EXCELLENT question for the next FTF thread - people sharing their TOP ~10 moments here... 

I'll post mine there in no particular order but for now I'll post my #1 of *all* time without a doubt... can't even imagine this sub without him being a part of it...

# /u/rschaosid 's 2nd unbanning.

Do you know your #1 or do you have to think about it?Zhige!!!

I can not remember you trying to snipe a k before LOL

You need to snipe maniac!! LOLI really like it when people leave those attempts - it helps tell the story when we aren't here to see the events...

#TOP 10 Hall of Fame!!

how long in the making?!?!?!?

**HUG**

from the subs #1 Cheerleader!

Whitney

It's pretty fucking cool to be looking at the leader board 9 ks' without a single 1st k and still being really happy - times have sure changed!!!... we just basically ran out of them LOL (except username....)
#mfw....Thank you hun!!

I am making a INDEX and putting all these charts to LIFE one day...

have you seen it??

Ive just got it started 

I have all your charts saved for it as well...

but we have a few needs that I am hoping you can fill... like you did with the BOLD the GETs..

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cxsffh0I switched back to my real name so you don't get confused this is whit - I was using the prank rs name LOL


Ok I'm 90% sure this added benefit can not be automated so it would require 5-10 minutes of your time depending on how you do it. But the number of seconds between the 999 and the 000 is very important in many ways ... and can be used in a number of ways... 

but for each chart - you'd have to go to the Hall of Fame ... go to the bottom open the thread where the get was done.. look at the timestamp of the 999 and the timestamp of the 000 and records that say at the bottom of the chart like

2 sec reply

if you want to see one example of how I use this data point see:

the very bottom of this comment...this is one of many many ways this can be used later if it's handy in this participation chart data..

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3vvufk/622k_counting_thread/cxrektvWhat me and you are doing - is saving these guys time so it's not a waste... he doesn't have time to be pesterd all the time wiht "can you add this and that and this and that

so what you are doing is helping the overall progress I think.. 

the bolding the get - the adding the 2nds the sniped by maniac that we are adding - just take his brilliant idea and make it even more useful than it already is which is very very great for this sub in the long run

you guys will be shocked when I'm done with what I am doing on my end with all this data you are harvasting

it will make the sheep saga look like kindergarten stuff LOLso just for fun thank Moo for the assist before you head back to the future

want a link? 

I can do it in two clicks :)/u/CaughtInDireWood

I'm JUMPIN' back to the last HUGE milestone to show you this....

If you get a chance check out the mini-gold train below.... it's pretty funny!!

This HUGE HUGE imporant # was got with a 4 second reply time - that's like really really slow when so many were trying! 

Anyhow - if you get bored read the comments - :)

Someday soon you'll be able to see any time or event here and respond 

in a few months - you can pop back to the count you are NOW doing - and see your first posts :)

you hun!!

I've spent an incredible amount of time in that thread - and actually recognize some of these names LOL/u/rschaosid

I know this stat pales in comparison to my amazing multiples of 45,379 chart-  but I think its at least chart worthy... can we see a chart for this please? I don't know why a drama in some side thread that only those there at the time (3 or 4) even know about - needs to be brought up in this FTF thread long after it's past.
the past several months :)

Anyhow I'm not a fan of bringing personal drama to a public thread so that's my say on this old drama...

If anyone hasn't noticed - I posted an incredible milestone congrats above..

Oh I know - wasn't trying to say you were bringing up that little personal spat I had a while back. I just think it has little to do with this FTF thread...

EDIT: I'm going back to celebrating..this isn't even worth reading this convo anymore... 
Oh I managed to be just one of a few - in the entire history of this sub.... to count numbers divisible by **43597**

I'm tied with two of the big-guys - blue and nitrome for this amazing feat!!! I'm planning on letting the BBC know so they can feature me in their next article about this sub - like they featured a counter here last time!!!

This is so historical it's even gilded in the Hall of Gold for all to see forever!

and I didn't even get any of your confetti!!!

DontCareILoveIt|1Thank you for waiting hun - my net froze up at 363!!!

These **369**'s aren't a major deal... I mean there will be over 350+ of them between now and a milion... so I'll be able to get plenty!

just gonna try for them when I can - so love ya'all waiting 1 min for me.... 

I see you waited over a minute... sooooo thanks for remembering me :)

**HUG**

Whitney#OMG!! It's RIP!!

#THE MAN

#THE LEGEND HIMSELF!!!

I saw your comment in the Hall of Gold!!!

Howdy, Howdy, Howdy!!

I'd like to resume my play-by-play of the weeks major events like I used too.... but there have been SOOOOOOO many this week, it would take me hours!!!

One of the Biggest - Moo doing an amazing **TRIPLE PLAY** I posted earlier....

if any really is interested in all the big events this week - you can scroll through my profile for the last 4-5 days and see just about all of them 

(not here for everything but most everything)

**HUG**

Your cheerleader and newbie mentor

WhitneyThis sub is just the OPPOSITE of the entire redddit...have you seen how many people get gold here for saying gold or asking for it or asking NOT to get it.... LOL I remember begging rs to stop gilding me and finally figured out I couldn't say G*LD anymore if I wanted him to stop LOL :) 


I loved the one where someone said

"please gild this"

(referring to the post above it ... and someone took them literally and gilded the "please gild this" LOL)

I swear I can get so much entertainment just reading the Hall of Gold...

especially the SuperDuckMan mini-gold train... too funny!!!#FUCK HITLERMooooooooooooooooooooove over all you STAT MEN!! There's a STAT WOMAN in da house... I'm going to be the keeper of the TRIPLE PLAY stat!!!

EDIT: My first attempt at keeping a STAT was an epic fail - rs posted an accurate one below... from now on I'll be using that one to do my updates - on my one stat-keeping-claim-to-fame here :) Congrats again Moo - still number 1 - even if it took you almost two whole days - SLACKER!!!!


Well because it's gonna be a while before I overtake atom's **60,000** counts - so in the meantime I want my own little claim to fame here in this main thread and that will be TOP COUNTER of **69**'s...

and since I think the 369 is so spiffy in many ways... that I picked that as my 69 to get.... 

because I love the # **69**

it's not like I want them to wait on me every single time a 369 comes about - it's just you waiting 1 min so I can try for it - if they happen to think about it... well that'd be cool.

There are an unlimited amount of them coming up so if I miss some it's so fine.

Thanks for asking! :)

/u/EVOSexyBeast I think we have a coincidence for you - :)##**CONGRATS**

That was a competitive one!

/u/Maniac_34 - why did you change your # ? If you were using a placeholder - that's against Etiquette #7... if you made a typo than it's all good.
##**CONGRATS**##

Are you keeping track of the # of snipes you've done?He didn't get the assist or the k - you are upset that he changed some random #? Is it because that confused you as to what to do next - or do you think he was actually trying to play unfairly (I can't see him doing that)I'm not any sort of boss or mod here - I'm just Whit...I think it was a simple mistake - perhaps he shouldn't have added that in later since it upset you. I am sure he wasn't trying to steal anything or play unfair .. but he wasn't really getting anything 998 isn't really any different than the other 997 #'s prior)  The only thing I can think of is that it messed up your count or strategy or something and that's unfortunate, but not on purpose I am sure. 

I am sure rideride will delete his # if you really want him to - can't imagine it mattering to him either way - and it's not like we don't have hundreds of deleted #'s over the years

That's why I always wait to comment on a reply - to avoid confusion because my comment will be last.  Sometimes I've had to wait quite some time to respond while waiting for someone to add a count - or send the person a message if need be.

Not saying everyone else should do as I do - just mentioning that's why I do wait until a counts been done to respond to a prior post.&gt; I must take the blame for all of this.

I'm pretty sure life will go on! 

Lemme ask Selene Dion.

We will have to think of some super-duper-punishment!!! 

I got one! 

Not allowed to take another Hiatus until after the 1,000,000 GET!
I looked back over everything that happened, I can understand now why you'd be frustrated or upset.  Maniac's get was 6 seconds, had you not been confused - it would have been your get (you'd been getting consistant 3-4 second replies for a few hundred counts prior)

Just know that nobody did anything intentionally wrong - it was a mistake, could have happened to anyone.

If it were me with this GET I'd ask them to put your name on it in the Hall of Fame - because judging from that 6 second lapse in time - it would have been yours had you not been confused by the missing 998 - added later.

Anyhow - 1 GET is probably kind of big for you now - but in the long run I don't think it will be... hopefully you can chalk this up to - this sub not being perfect like most everything else in life.

Oh and congrats on being #16 counter of all time!! Movin' on up!

**HUG**

WhitneyIt's ok hun!!! You made a mistake, had it been at any other moment in time but that precise one - nobody would have ever even noticed it... don't blame yourself for not being perfect.  We all make mistakes - more often then we can count!Oh don't take a break (at least not a long one) over this... I see 20,000 - 30,000 counts go by without incident often.  This was just a fluke really - the GET should go to Xeam in my opinion though - that 6 second reply tells that Xeam would have gotten it for sure if not for the simple mistake.**Clan of the Cave Bear** - Jean Aul - 

one of the best fiction books of-all-time.

**Still Me** - Christopher Reeve.  

This book totally changed my life, it was impossible for me to feel sorry for myself for anything I was going through.  Compared to what he had to endure.  He goes into graphic detail about everything he has to go through on a daily basis.

If you feel sorry for yourself, or things you go through in life, I *highly* recommend this book!

A safe word should be something she'd never say  during sex normally... like grapefruit or republican for example.

If you try this way to early in a relationship - first month or two - you may find yourself doing 10 behind bars.  Unlikely -but possible - you have to be able to trust your partner, and know their signals etc.539,252

539,254

aaaaaaaaand I'm counting - WOOHOO

539,256

have to get the hang of this though!!539,258

ok!! sweet dreams!

well my counting experience was pretty short lived!

Well since I've been in a similar situation - about to be hit by a train...

I can say - every second is like an hour - and in that minute you'll have a whole lot of thoughts.

My # 1 thought at the time however was:

This is going to hurt!!!

OK story time:

Years ago - I was on the other side of the state - took my 9 year old son to a park to have lunch.

Some guy (who I found out later liked the way I looked in my jeans - so he wanted to keep me around) wanted to show my son the fish spawning.  He was taking him onto this train tressel in the middle of the river.

I said no way - what if a train shows up - he shows me the tall growth of the grass on the rails and says he's lived there 15 years and there's never been a train on this track. Keep arguing.

So he convinces me and we get in the middle of the trestle... I hear a train whistle. He continues calmly chatting - so I think nothing of it.  Several seconds later I hear another train whistle.

I start to say "I sure hope that trains not on this track" - about halfway through the sentence - the train comes from around the corner and is right there.

He and my son take off running *towards* the train!!! WTF? 

I take a huge step trying to grab my son to go away from the train... instead I lose my footing and my kneecap crashes into a spike.  I feel no pain but when I try to stand I can't move.

So I'm watching as my son looks at me, and then at the train that's about to hit him. He jumps. The guy who convinced me this was an abandon track - grabs me and throws me off and I land on that same knee on the rocks below.

But in those seconds - every second seemed like an hour - so many thoughts.  But mostly "This is going to hurt!!"

This brilliant man now claimed my leg was *not* broken... so three times I tried to stand - three times I passed out from the pain. Because of the idiot causing me to put weight on it 3 times - it messed my knee up pretty bad.

Here's a funny part of this story though - I was a bit delirious from pain - and I kept saying "I thought it was a real train!!"

It was just engine - one car and a caboose.

So in my mind I thought I was going to get hit by a "real" train - ie 20 car train.  As if getting hit by the engine wouldn't have "hurt" - or killed my butt. 

This was in fact an abandoned track - but once a year they did a maintance run... I just happened to be there the one minute of the year they were going to be on that trestle!

EDIT: Forgot to mention for over a decade afterwords - I could hear trains all the time. I'd lived in my home for 9 years never heard a train - but after this happened I heard several a day.  Every time for the first few years, it brought back that feeling I had when I was laying there looking at a train coming at me.  

&gt; I dumped their ass like they were a red-hot cannonball.

the TL;DR:

Previous abuse, extreme low self esteem, a shrinking support system, belief that they will change, the honeymoon period, finances, children, fear he'll kill himself or her.

---


Doesn't sound like you left after the first signs or the first physical abuse yourself?

It's extremely complicated... almost all women who get involved in an abusive relationship were abused or controlled as children.  They tend to have rock bottom self esteems - even if they are a 10.  

Most of the time it starts out very gradually - and often as time goes on they lose their support system, friends, family etc.

By the time it gets to the point that it's obvious you should leave, they are often in love and believe that the person they saw when they were being seduced into the relationship - is the man he really is.  That this abusiveness isn't how he 'really is'

Each time - they make promises and convince the person they will change.

The longer this goes on the less outside support - help they usually have - people judge/blame them for allowing the abuse and the person starts to blame themselves for the abuse as well.

Each time the abuse tends to be a little worse - and each time the abuser says / does something else to convince them it'll be different now.

Very often the man will say he'll kill himself if she leaves - she loves him and doesn't want to be the cause of his death.  Often times she's afriad he'll kill her if she leaves. (happens all the time in the USA - you are safe when you leave, until they believe it's over forever - then it's extremely dangerious)


Quite often the woman ends up stuck for financial reasons - having to chose between him and his 'changing' - or being on the streets.
 
Very often - the woman will have a child believing it'll make things better - or just to have someone in their life who will love them without abusing them.  

Once there are children involved its really hard to  leave, and even harder to stay away because they have to see the abuser for visitation and thus another opporunity to convince her to give him another chance.

In my case - I dealt with 9 yrs of verbal abuse - but the first time he ever hit me - I told him if he ever did it again I'd leave.  He did and I left forever.  Worse mistake ever - if I had it all to do over again, I would have left once during those years of verbal abuse.  The extreme situation I found myself in because I wouldn't give him a '2nd chance' - put me through absolute hell for a couple of years.

So I personally recommend leaving once early on - and then for *good* the 2nd time he ever gets physical.  

Anyhow - it's extremely complicated - I just touched on a few of dozens of reasons and causes why women stay.

It's so funny I see this constantly when it comes to black lives matter...

and yet in my *entire* life - I have never seen anyone ever say anything to people being activist for other things...

Never seen someone say 

Heart disease matters!!! at a Cancer walk or fund  raiser.

Never seen anyone say Lung Cancer matters!!! at a Breast Cancer fund raiser or walkathon.

Never seen anyone shouting what about the floods on the east coast!!! at a "hurricane help center"

I could list 1000 different causes that I've *never* seen anyone take issue with or shout for their specific cause at the other cause.

I think it's pretty telling that I see people taking issue with "Black lives matter" - all over the internet.


Black lives do matter - anyone who takes issue with people saying this - are total hypocrits because they do NOT take issue with those saying "cancer patience matter" or "Hurricane victims matter" etc.

I **challenge** you to find me two instances - *ever* where someone stepped into someone else's cause and took issue with it - or argued that it took away from all the ther serious issues or causes that exist.

I'll wait....At the top is the clitoris - just below that the urethra (where women pee from) just below that the vagina (where you stick your penis in) below that the anus.

Here's a really good picture for you to look at (NSFW I suppose... nothing dirty about the female anatomy though)

http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/biology-of-the-female-reproductive-system/female-external-genital-organs&gt; You don't direct away from the original cause. You scope out. You become more general and cover a larger audience. Why would you not want to save more people?

Ok - I like your very civil tone!! Not the norm in these type convo's!

**The TL;DR** 

Instead of hijacking someone else's cause - the thousands complaining about the "BLM" movement - could effect change if they actually DID something besides complaining and taking issue with the "BLM" - they should not be forced to take up everyone else's causes - and I've yet to see *any* other cause being bashed so much for not doing so.

---



So it's extremely complicated and I can't cover 1% of it... but let me share a few things:


You said:

"What is happening is people are looking at the facts. They notice that it isn't just black people who are being killed. It's blacks, whites, asians, mexicans, everyone. PEOPLE. ALL LIVES MATTER. We don't need to be killing each other period."

Yes. Yes. Yes.

Here's the thing though - how many white people (or Asian etc) are taking an *active* role in trying to end police killing of unarmed innocent people?  

Compare that to the # of them - who speak up whenever they hear "Black lives matter"

Those who do care about the police violence against everyone - should be spending their time trying to do something about it - not spending their time discussing - putting down those who say "Black lives matter"

Take up the cause yourself - don't try to hijack another race's cause.

Black people have learned very well over the decades that things won't change unless they become activists and try and force a change. 

If white people are genuinely concerned with the white / asian etc unarmed boys getting killed by police - than why is it I never heard a single word about it ever until the "Black lives matter" movement started.  Now suddenly they are taking issue with those activist - because "All lives matter" but they don't do anything to effect change... they just critize and take issue with the wording of the movement started by another race.

I know of 1000's of different causes - and issues - this is the first one I can recall where thousands of people all over the internet are taking issue with the wording of a cause.  Why do you think that is?

Most agree they should have used different phrasing "Black lives matter TOO" - but it's also evident that many many people are intentionally rewording a very specific set of words to mean "ONLY Black lives matter" - why intentionally change the actual words to fit a narrative?  

TO me this honestly seems racist (subconsciously perhaps)  - they didn't say "ONLY Black lives matter"  

They are saying our boys are getting gunned down in the streets at an alarming level.... and they want to see something change.

If in fact white people (asian or what-have-you) want to see the police murders stop - instead of rewording another race's cause to make it look bad - why don't they spend their time and energy actually doing something to make change? How much is that happening - compared to the time they spend putting down the "Black lives matter (too)" cause?

The biggest problem the movement has - is that it allowed itself to be associated with the "Hands up don't shoot" (ie a criminal who'd tried to steal a gun) - this set them back so far... because unfortunately so many don't want to look beyond that and realize all the many other cases where this movement needed to happen because of.


Eric Gardner for example - they chocked him to death over lose cigerrettes - if this is happening to whites, why haven't we seen that?

The little boy who had a toy gun and they shot him within two seconds of pulling up - instead of keeping their distance and trying to resolve the situation?  I just haven't seen this with little white boys on my news channels.

It's amazing having such a civilized convo about this!! You are very articulate!  I agree with sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much of what you said in your brief (hehe) comment. Almost everything - and some of it is sooooo spot on.

But I'm going to address a few things I disagree with or would like to have you concider...

&gt;The other aspect is that many of these interactions go bad because the person being stopped wants to be stupid. So now if you break that down and realize that the amount of times that a bad police officer has done something to someone who doesn't deserve it, it is actually quite low.

This one!!!

I can't possibly tell you how many times I've seen someone say something similiar to this over the past year.

"If they'd stop resisting, not run, or stop acting up, etc"

Being STUPID, acting up, resisting arrest, running etc are NOT - absolutely NOT capital punishment acts.  Unless an officer or the public's lives are in danger - an officer should NOT be judge - jury and instant EXECUTIONER.

You said:

"done something to someone who doesn't deserve it" - 

those who deserve to be shot ON THE SPOT - deserve it.  That's not what we are addressing here.  But so often I hear whenever someone brings up bad cops murdering unarmed black boys &amp; men - I hear comments such as those.  Implying if they deserve to be shot ON THE SPOT with no judge, no jury, no sentence. Dead. Forever. Because they ran because they were rightly scared? Because they acted a fool? Because they didn't obey the officer.  Not obeying is NOT something you should be shot DEAD for.

Unfortunately it takes away from what's really happening to blame the victims in these cases to take away from the bad cops who murder people and the bad cops who cover up for them or don't join with us to try to get them removed from the force.



Now as far as you making it sound like the majority of people who take issue with the "Black lives matter" movement are genuinely caring about it?  Are you aware of how many *thousands* of times in the past year whenever blacks bring up the fact that their unarmed boys are being gunned down by police at an alarming rate - INSTANTLY say "If you care about black lives - why aren't you doing something about black-on-black murders in your communities" 

Does this sound like people trying to "work with them" and "on the same team" etc?  No.  They are trying to take away from this movement to stop police executioners for "resisting" or "selling cigs" - by bringing up a completely different issue and suggesting because of that OTHER issue - they are being hypocritcal by trying to stop those hired to serve and protect from killing them!!

As far as the news and the media - they are as crooked as they come - anything *anything* to make money.   

For every Jon Bennett Ramsey there are a dozen black girls that go missing that barely even make the local news.

The only reason black boys getting shot are making the news this year - is because it sells advertising space!!

Anyhow - this has been an interesting and educational convo... 

I'll leave it with this:

Suggesting they "deserve" to be shot dead without a judge and jury or legal representation for anything short of being a threat to the officer or public - is horrible and contributes to the mindset of those bad cops believing as they do..

Taking "Black lives matter" to mean "ONLY Black lives matter" - is deceptive and agenda driven.

Suggesting people don't care about blacks killing blacks when discussing with "Black lives matter" is unfair and again takes away from doing something to stop these bd cops from killing unarmed boys for being scared and not instantly becoming obeying robots.

You can have the last word!!  Thanks for the civil convo!

**HUG**

I don't know - but I think for most school shooters they want to die and want to make a name for themselves on their way out.  And our Media glorifies them so they get their final wish at the expense of childrens lives - but making more ad revenue is more important than not glorifying these killers. Thus encouraging more.

So I'd imagine they aren't there to kill as many as they possibly can - just enough to make a name for themselves and make those who hurt/bullied/dumped them pay via these subsitutes.

I think the Columbine shooters were the exception - they wanted a really high body count - hence the bombs they planted.

The rest of these shooters - I think they just want to kill enough to get their names and stories in front of a national audience and they know that doesn't require a high body count.

Just my thoughts - don't have the answer.Can only speak for myself..

breastfeeding didn't cause any sexual sensation (ie .. arousal) it's extremely painful at first - and by the time it's not your breasts are pretty desensitized. 

As far as if they still cause arousal with your partner - for me I didn't really like it while breastfeeding... but after I had stopped - it was still very arousing for my partner to suck, tease them.  Don't know about anyone else but for me - age has made it not nearly as arousing for my partner to suck/play with them.

&gt; Does the desensitization ever stop?

Can only speak for myself - I breastfeed longer than most women (almost 2 yrs)

It took about two years after I stopped breastfeeding  before I noticed them being really sensative and sexually arousing again. They were pretty much back to the way they were pre-breastfeeding after 3 years.

Now though (40+) it doesn't really do anything for me to have my nips teased / sucked at all.  Don't know if that's normal or rare though.There's actually another exercise a woman can do that tightens things up even better and much more noticable.

Laying on one's side and doing leg lifts slowly -  while tightening that area... about 20 reps on each side.  Surprisingly though - I've never really read about this.  I learned this from my sister-in-law years ago. It works so well that without having told my hubby I'd done them - he noticed immediately the next time we had sex - the first time I did them.I hear what you are saying - if you'd like a better understanding as to why they aren't comparable.

If you've ever asked yourself "Why is it ok to have a Black Miss America, or a Black History month..." etc 

I can recommend this book - it'll really open your eyes and make it so much less frustrated when dealing with and understanding black people.

It's called:

Yup men who were raised to believe it's not manly to cry - continue this with their own kids.

And they wonder why there is an epidemic of boys / young men committing suicide in the USA?

REAL MEN CRY! It's natural - we are born crying and many of us go out crying... in between "real men don't show emotion" - no some bottle it up and it manifest in being abusive to their partners or turning to drugs.Seems to me - here in the good-ole-USA they are just teaching them now how to NOT be kids - they start drugging them for acting like kids in kindergarten now! 

Oh how many studies have been done to deterimine the long term effects of giving millions of children Ritilan at such a young age. 

Seems interesting that as the oldest of this group are coming of age, meth is becoming an epidemic in many cities and towns all across America.
Sigh.A message from the two non moderators.oh aren't you all fancy in your *green* username!turned it on

turned it off

too many colors!

I'm sure you are not alone in feeling like this - and I am sure it applies to alot of other situations as well.

If I were in your shoes though - I'd really consider finding someone to talk to about it - if you can't see a therapist - perhaps someone online?

Here's one possible resource until you find a better alternative...


https://www.7cupsoftea.com/There are many different kinds of love, and many different degrees of love.

I'll answer it as to how it relates to your last paragraph....

Just finding someone sexy doesn't really mean you "love them" - so no I don't think you'd call a friend you find sexy someone you "love"

Pretty much when you fall in love - you'll know it.  It's kind of indescribable - but most likely you will know it when it happens.

Some things that may happen (but not all of these - and not in all cases)

In the beginning:

You think about them all the time...

You miss them when they are gone...

You really enjoy being with them and spending time with them...

You really like certain things about them - their smile - their voice - the way they smell - their laugh - things like that.

When you think about losing them (not being able to spend time with them / be with them) it hurts. An actual physical pain in the chest sometimes. 

You don't want them to be with someone else...

Usually you are physically attracted to them - no matter how good looking others might find them...

Usually when they touch you (Anywhere) you get a feeling - perhaps a tingle or warm fuzzy feeling...

Most of these are more prevalent at the beginning of the relationship and as I said - not all apply.

Hope that helps.18 is pretty young!  Some girls aren't ready for sex at that age.

Its possible she seems to have no attraction to sexual activities because she doesn't want to start something she's not ready to finish. Or because she doesn't want to lead you on. Or because she's terrified.  It can be pretty scary prior to your first time.

I will say however and please listen to this:

Do **not** marry her - until you are sure you are sexually compatible. IE have at least somewhat compatible sex drives.  

If you have any doubts about me being right on this... spend a few hours in the sub /r/DeadBedrooms and you'll see what your future holds if she ends up just not being into sex - a 24/7 nightmare. Instead of what's likely going on - age and fear etc.

I imagine you don't realize this but for a girl - losing her virginity can a be very very scary idea. Be patient.  Each month try to introduce something more to your sexual relationship - while making sure she knows you are *not* expecting her to go 'all the way'

Examples of things to gradually introduce... 

washing each other in the shower... with a bit of extra washing of certain areas. 

sensual messages

spooning nakid or with her just in her panties... (let her know you'll be hard as a brick and it's gonna be OK - be sure to masturbate prior to trying this one for the first or 10th time LOL)

texting each other a naughty story about some sexual experience you'd like to have someday...

things like this... just always assure her that you are not expecting *more* at this time.



There are so many levels of depression - someone who's never experienced the hell of an extreme depression -  don't realize that when they say they suffer from depression they are referring to something not so severe.

But part of the reason there are so many people suffering from depression here - is because it's kind of a magnet for depressed people. A way to - even if it's just a tiny bit - take your mind off of the insanity of the 5000 thoughts a second you normally have. 

When someone says "I suffer from depression" - that tells you very little about their condition.  Could be they are having a bad week/month and are not as happy as normal.  Could be that they spend every waking moment (dealing with it **86,400** seconds a day)  - so desperate to die - that it's completely unbearable.  

Someone saying they suffer from depression - should not lose its credibility just because there are different levels of depression... could be that person you brush off or ignore - may be at their very last straw. And you could save a life (or 7... since they have 7 vital organs that can one day save 7 other people)

 Awesome!! Glad I was able to help.

I'm going to repeat something though - because it's pretty important I think.  It's really not enough to say once in a while "I'm not going to pressure you to go all the way" - pretty much every time you want to do something sexual in nature with her, you should say something like that - otherwise she'll be afraid to join in - or enjoy what's going on because she is afraid it'll make you want to go further. (also - I'm sure you know masturbating before any of these types of activities will help you not feel so frustrated and be able to enjoy them more)

Good luck - save my name and send me a wedding invite in a few years!!!

**HUG**

How about Travon Martins murderer - I'll plant a bag of skittles next to the body and claim I had NO possible choice but to get out of the security of my 2000 lbs suit of protection (ie car) with a loaded gun... and had to stand my ground, once I got OUT of my car to have ground to stand on.

If I'm going out - I'd be happy to take this lowlife  scum of the earth with me.  My 2 cents?

When is the last time you have seen someone bring up a *positive* or uplifting statistic about minorities on Reddit? I have been on Reddit over 2 years and don't recall ever seeing one.

Usually when a statistc or fact involving a minority is mentioned - it's to show something negative or degrading etc... if that person were to mention a postitive statistic and a negative one - doubt they'd be called a racist.  

Another thing - statistics about minorities tend to be very biased and do rarely take into consideration many many things that relate to those statistics.  Many statistics about minorities - when vetted - tell a completely different story.  Not taking that into consideration when blindly telling 'facts' without knowing the actual reality behind those stats - can be racists... because it paints that race with an inaccurate and broad brush.



Just ask yourself this:

How many times have I seen  a negative statistic about _______ (you name it... how often have you done seen *that* stat?)

vs.

How many times have I seen a negative statistic about minorities?

I've probably seen at least 200 mentions of black on white crime stats... and black on black crime rates on Reddit.  Don't recall seeing a single mention of White-on-White crime rates on Reddit (except rarely when using it to show how much worse black crime rate is...)  

Women commit murder too - how many times have you seen statistics on that on Reddit?  

Next time you ever see a statistic used in regards to minority on reddit that is *positive* send me a PM... till then realize the reason it seems racist is because using stats and facts in regards to race, is almost always to point out something negative not positive about that race.

The way stats are twisted and manipulated is a fascinating study that I'd recommend spending some time on - if you wish to use stats in regards to something negative about another race.




I actually started this thread - but couldn't quite figure out how to explain my idea - so I deleted it (or so I thought)

The idea was something along the lines of - Person posts some obscure # - person who figures out what it means  - ie correct responder posts another obscure # and so it goes from there...

It won't let us post new comments - soooooo don't think this will last long - but we can work out the kinks here and see if it's worth starting a new thread.&gt; my wounds are fresh.

Most of us have been there! It really helps to focus only on the negatives when you are dwelling on it.  Thinking about the positives does not help you in *any* way.  Unless she was a perfect saint - there had to be bad times and bad situations etc - focus on those until the wounds start to heel.  

And as much as you may miss her - and want her back - realize if it hadn't happened now, it's very likely it would a years from now... with kids (or more kids) involved - more of your 'best years' gone etc.

Also try and focus on the fact that if you found her - you can find someone else - and there's a chance that person will make you happier!

Just try to be careful about being someone who is likely a good catch in the near future - quick rebound relationships are almost always doomed.  Try to avoid getting close to good catches until you can go a few days at a time without thinking about the gal who broke your heart.

&gt; 'She's getting banged by someone else right now' 


No. No. No.

She's on the first day of her period - with cramps and a super headache to go with it... trust me!&gt; 2.718281828

from what I could find this is "Euler's number" 

Ahh from more research - I say I got this one right:

2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995  

Perfect match. 
way to complicated for me to figure out what the heck it means though!

Is this the correct answer?
7.3 million


##**CONGRATS!!**

You are 130ish away from TOP 5!!Um ya I'd definately settle for being in the TOP 3 (like most competitive events) - because you'd have to be a mad man for trying to stay ahead of rs!!  I can't see him giving up his #2 spot in the next century LOL.

Personally if it were me - I'd be totally fine being in the TOP 10 in a 3 1/2 year old competition!! That's huge!&gt; 2023rd????

I don't like that number!

I'll have to go for 2020 - like that #.

How do I tell how many I need to move up 3 spots?

Is it customary to combine counts from your other username? 

I'd rather just stick with the counts from this name - if that's possible

Had to scroll for a # I like - 1100 will do the trick! 

Actually I want to end up in the top 500 at some point...;)  So I have a bit of counting to do!!This is the first time I've ever seen this complete chart - had no idea it even existed!!

Took me a while to find me on there LOL.  I just have to do 83 counts to be in the top 500... that should be easy enough to do.

Does anyone have a total count of the # of counters listed on there?I knew it was over 7000 - didn't realize it's approaching 8000! I have encouraged alot of people to count once to add their names to the history books though - so not surprised.

I wish I was good at math (I am about a 4th grade level when it comes to math - great at alot of things just not that) because statistics and compiling this info - interested me alot.

I just have to rely on rs to help me with getting the info I want here LOL.

Prior to tonight - I wasn't aware there was a list beyond the 600 list I've checked many times.  This list is going on my toolbar!

EDIT: I do intend to be in the TOP 500 though.  That's good enough for me!##**CONGRATS!!**

You are now one of the TOP 100 counters of all time!



Now that you are in the TOP 100 - you can check the regular chart instead of that 7,800+ people chart!

https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=100

Here's the chart I was reading when I noticed you were just 3 away... if you are curious:

https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=10000

(You'll be added to that first one I mentioned when rs updates it)

That list only list the top 25 - the one I gave ~~her~~ him lists the  top 100.

https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=100

sorry /u/rideride typo - he's definately a manly-man!&gt; I'm so happy you're one of us now!

Me too!! I'm going for the TOP 500 counters - 83 counts to go...I'm gonna count on Sundays (my BF doesn't come over till after 3:00 on Sundays) - so I should have no problem getting the 83.

Not going to set a goal after the 500 though... way to many #'s and time involved to get to the top 200 or whatever.

500 works for me!

I'm bummed listening to you guys talking about the music on your computers... I used to have 100's of awesome music on mine.  But unless I buy some speakers for my laptop - there's no point in listening to music on it... at top volume it's not even easy to hear music or talking on here.


Do you guys have any idea how often I read through the days comments and wonder who's passing the bong???? 

This convo belongs in /r/trees not /r/counting!!!!&gt; Short strings of random characters until one I liked

You got me wondering how others pronounce your username...

most the time when I think of you or refer to you it's rs  r-s  but when I think of your user name in my head it sounds like this:

R - ra - shod

(not even close to your actual username but after the first time I tried to pronounce it - I went with R - ra - shod and that's how it's always been ever since)Interesting!! I'm betting everyone here says it in their head (pronounces it) different!

Mine isn't even close to his actual spelling - but it's the first thing I came up with so it stuck... I'll always think of him as "R ra shod"  (shod as it's pronounced in shoddy)while you two are talking about Atom - Atom and I are talking about rs elsewhere in this thread...scroll back a bit and see!

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments&gt; The amount of coincidences

Speaking of coincidences - did you happen upon that BBC article from the link I gave you a little while ago for the TIDBITS thread which mentions it? Or was it from you doing a google search? 

This sub was also mentioned on Mashable.com - a pretty mainstream site.

I emailed them in regards to the 500,000 but it was a bit too late for them to do anything with it.  For the 1,000,000 I'll email them a couple weeks ahead of time.That's funny then - because in the last hour I gave you a link to the TIDBITs thread - in which that BBC article is mentioned... and then shortly after - you mention the article!

World gets smaller every day when you are online!Just noticed your edits in the TIDBITs thread - too funny... 

You are missing something though:

5) Best moment was probably getting unbanned. 

should say

5) Best moment was probably getting ~~unbanned.~~ unbanned again!

P.S. Unless you have the TIDBITs thread bookmarked - I find the fastest way to get there is via the top of the FTF thread.I just noticed your first number here was a palidrome!! Well it *is* your first # and it *is* a palidrome.  I'm sure since somewhere in the first 3,000 we've been "behind" - doesn't mean someones first # isn''t their first # right?

So basically the way you are looking at it - nobody's first # is actually their first # - even if it is in fact the first number they counted here in /r/counting - because technically *every* number here is not correct... even if just one # was missed in the past 540,000 numbers.

I don't see how you can say that the first number you typed here was 207,702 but it wasn't in fact the first # you typed here?  Seems pretty black and white to me - you pressed those 6 #'s on your keyboard - to later say you didn't in fact type those six numbers here as your first number - doesn't make much sense to me.

Perhaps it's just the verbage we are using isn't connecting.

As far as claiming it as some sort of 'sub palidrome' - when it wasn't correct in the current count adjustment makes sense... but to say the number 207,702 is not a palidrome and it wasn't in fact the first number you counted here - is confusing me!

But I'll let you have the last word!

*HUG*
Well my best moment here so far was you getting unbanned the *2nd* time - you are part of our family here!

I would have been upset for a very long time had you not come back!Here's my thoughts on this - 

I think you could put a few hundred hours into trying to make it perfect (from comment #1) and it still would not be perfect... I've spent probably 20 hours in the first 12,000 comments - it's beyond description as to it's messiness and cluster-fuck.  

Is there anyone but you who cares that the count is absolutely perfect through out years of counting and almost 8,000 counters?

Since it'd be next to impossible to completely make it perfect - and you'd have to change everyone else's work they've done through the years... seems like it'd be rs's count not a collaborative effort of 7,800 people?  

I mean do you plan on changing other peoples #'s? Deleting others #'s? Etc?  

Honestly - I can think of at least a dozen things you could do for this sub - that'd make a much, much bigger difference. And effect alot more people, and make alot of people here's time more pleasant etc.... with the time it'd take to try and make the count "perfect"  - is what you are planning to do going to make everyone who has ever counted here no longer be able to consider their first # - their first #?

How many people will personally benefit from that time and effort - as opposed to other awesome things you could do for this sub that many would benefit from... perhaps for years to come.

I have several ideas on things you can do for us - just waiting because I know you've been busy...

Anyhow - it's just something to consider. Well I'm taking about how it was on *our* side of things... I saw your first ban, just a couple of curious comments.... you did notice a difference this time I hope!  *Everyone* immediately got involved in getting you unbanned.  Everyone wanted you back!  I did everything I possible could to ensure you'd be back... (not taking credit for you being unbanned - everyone spoke up and everyone did what they could to get you back!)

I've seen many of the oldies here say that things have gotten alot more personal and family oriented the past year... so perhaps that's why this time you staying banned would have been drastically different.

I'd love to tell you my reaction to your banning at first but you'd probably think I'm a nut! I did *not* take it well! 

But then I realized me freaking out wasn't going to help fix this - so I had to calm down and start doing what I could to help make it happen! 



But I based on the fact you kept involved and in touch with people here etc during those 14 months clearly tells me that the sub was pretty important to you even back then!

You are special - and you are special to all of us - don't forget that!!



Well we can discuss this more later - but I see no possible way to make the count perfect without completely changing the collaborative efforts of thousands done over thousands and thousands of hours.

Every single # since the first missed # that was not corrected would have to be edited... because they are technically incorrect #s.  Every GET, every assist, every palidrome ever would no longer be valid.  The only way to redo all those missing comments would be for a different person to enter each one or you'd be breaking the most funamental rule here - no double counting.  

If the intent of all those who started this count was for it to be perfect - they would have had to give up in the first 1000#'s and none of us would be here today - discussing changing history and possibly invalidating 500,000+ counts because they were not "correct" 

You seem pretty dead set on this however - hopefully you can find a way to do this without invalidating the other 7,800 who've contributed here's count. 

I'm a bit confused if me counting here on Sundays has a point - if every # I count is going to be considered wrong and not a valid count because in the year 2012 someone missed a count...therefore every count since has been wrong.

I just wonder if one person making the decision to change things for 7,800 people makes a ton of  sense...



EDIT: Anyhow - I'm off to sleep g'nite hun! **HUG**I'm sorry james - had I known our side convo was going to continue for so many comments and clutter up the counting screen so much I would have taken the discussion to PMs (I'll be more aware in the future) 

Sweet dreams!

**HUG**

Whitney##**CONGRATS!!**

You did fool me! I read comments here from bottom to top and when I saw your 

brb 10 min

at 540,998 - I was like WTH???

I like you adding TOP 100 to your flair!!I like your idea pixel - thought about it -  I think it'd make sense to make my plan 10 counts a day - instead of unlimited once a week.  

For a variety of reasons, but especially since I'll get to count with alot more different people this way! Also because I'll get my name on alot more of rs's participation charts!



541,225

Welcome to the sub /u/camelhumpsaresexy 

For those wondering why I'm now going to be a counter here - I've decided that I can count 10 counts a day from now on!  But I'm still the subs #1 cheerleader!!541,227

Awww hug!!541,229541,231541,233

sorry camel541,235541,239541,241

Going great! You?541,244541,246

aaaaaaaaaaand I'm done!

camel - sorry I'm new to actually counting here too - should be a bit easier with just the two of you counting now!

**HUG**

Whitney &gt; proposal: save 543 210 for whitney

Awww that's sweet hun.... but I'm hoping Atom gets it to go with his other biggies the 234,567 etc...

Now I'm off to do my 10 counts for the day! 543,025

aaaaaaaaaand I'm counting woohoo!!543,027

Howdy *river*!!
543,030

That's ok blue - if it is up to me I say give it to Atom to go with his other biggies like the 234,657543,035

Ride - I don't know what happened I typed in the # but it didn't "take" so had to do an edit... still getting the hang of this counting lol543,037



I know it's pretty weird feeling myself, after seeing 150,000+ counts, having my name in it when I check the page is odd!!

blue - snipe away - all the big #'s are fair game - think its sweet that you and rs were willing to give it up for me though ... awww :)543,039

was waiting for blue - not sure how to do a 3 person rotation yet...543,043

Howdy Manaic - so glad Pixel gave me this suggestion - 10 a day means I get to count with lots of different people!&gt; 1000 comments

Yup there was a lot of chit-chat in this thread - so much so we actually irritated james543,045

Hence my slipery slope reason for not counting... I'm gonna stick with 10 - I think it's a great idea!!

Howdy rs - fancy counting with you!543,047

should I save count #10 for the attempt at the 543,210 - naaa I'll have no luck against Maniac he can get 1 second response times - I'm working on 5 seconds!543,049

Ok - I'm gonna try for it what the hell - hoping Atom gets it but if not hopefully me!!

I think I'm at 9 now soooo - see you at the finish line!!##**CONGRATS!!**

I had no luck - on my screen I had to hit "continue this thread" by the time I did that - way to late!

It's ok - if you hadn't got it someone else would have!

I'm not really here for GETs - but love rooting other people on for them! Especially when one of those I brought here got the 400,000! That was too cool!

BTW - I posted something to you earlier that you probably missed - check your inbox about 30 #'s ago! Please use the DontCareILoveIt in the stats and stuff... Thanks!I am sooooooooooooo not buying it blue - selling any bridges??I have an idea - a Hall of 500's - hopefully one that people won't try for during times we have an influx of newbies (when mentioned in other subs etc) 

For those who GET 500 counts in a k... I think there are two of you with that stat at this time?Actually I just noticed that - a 4 second reply got it... I tried for it but on my screen it said "continue this thread" - I am still learning how to do this, I think I should have hit permalink a few numbers earlier? Is that how that's done to avoid the 'continue next thread' thing?
Yup now that I realize a permalink a few #'s before the GET would have helped, I had it copied and ready to go... but when I hit refresh to put it in - I had to continue next thread soooooooo... anyhow it's all good, I'm not that interested in getting the GETs myself but I do like it when others do! I wanted Atom to get it because he's gotten two other sequential #'s like it already!

and rs got Pixel's palidrome - heads are gonna roll!!

Won't be long now and you'll be in the TOP 10 counters of all time! Probably in the next week or  two! 

You and Atom's k competition at this point is making this sub alot more interesting!

Happy counting - 

FYI I'll put a bid on the bridge your selling - keep me informed!

**HUG**

WhitneyLOL!

You are amazing!  

I am thinking - 'if you build it they will come" - 

"if you ask for it, rs will build it"

You should keep that stat handy somewhere - it'll probably encourage some counters to count more to try to get on this list! 

I could of sworn someone else got 500 just recently - since the 500k but I don't think your stats can be wrong so I must be mistaken.
Thinking you should change your flair now that your in the TOP 5!!

EDIT: Have you noticed everyone's now calling you riverride? instead of /u/rideride LOLWow! That's alot of 400+ counts!  

Turns out it was Xeam I was thinking of - didn't realize he missed by 1 # - now I want to go back and see who "stole" his 1 # but you could probably tell me that in the time it took me to find the thread...

did you happen to notice someone was not so happy with us rambling on and on in the counting thread the other night?  oooops!I figured you could find it quicker than I could find the thread - thanks!

/u/bluesolid - you are brutal!!!sssssssssssssomebody has alot of editing to do!!!##\#**Blameblue!!**##**Congrats!!**

Was considering trying for a snipe for Atom - but I couldn't do that to you, not after you offered to lemme have the 543,210!!

**HUG**

~~2~~ 3 more?rs - blue and ride both ignored your mistake - blue for 100+ counts... start plotting your revenge!!!Thanks - don't know how I missed that!

Please do a participation chart for the last k - would love to have my name in one with more than one #!!

Have fun changing 150+ counts... you could probably write a program to fix them faster than doing them one by one LOL!

G'nite hun!!##**CONGRATS**

That was a competitive one!

[whispering](/s Just a few more GETs and you'll be caught up with Atom!)##**INDEX OF COUNTERS IN THIS THREAD**

/u/Maniac_34 - why did you change your # ? If you were using a placeholder - that's against Etiquette #7... if you made a typo than it's all good.
##**CONGRATS**##

Are you keeping track of the # of snipes you've done?He didn't get the assist or the k - you are upset that he changed some random #? Is it because that confused you as to what to do next - or do you think he was actually trying to play unfairly (I can't see him doing that)I'm not any sort of boss or mod here - I'm just Whit...I think it was a simple mistake - perhaps he shouldn't have added that in later since it upset you. I am sure he wasn't trying to steal anything or play unfair .. but he wasn't really getting anything 998 isn't really any different than the other 997 #'s prior)  The only thing I can think of is that it messed up your count or strategy or something and that's unfortunate, but not on purpose I am sure. 

I am sure rideride will delete his # if you really want him to - can't imagine it mattering to him either way - and it's not like we don't have hundreds of deleted #'s over the years

**HUG**I've noticed ya'all haven't added your TIDBITs here in /r/counting yet - you don't have to of course, but it'd be great if you did!  You can learn about your fellow counters, and they can learn a bit about you! 


Here's the link - just add yours wherever you see fit:

That's why I always wait to comment on a reply - to avoid confusion because my comment will be last.  Sometimes I've had to wait quite some time to respond while waiting for someone to add a count - or send the person a message if need be.

Not saying everyone else should do as I do - just mentioning that's why I do wait until a counts been done to respond to a prior post.&gt; I must take the blame for all of this.

I'm pretty sure life will go on! 

Lemme ask Selene Dion.

We will have to think of some super-duper-punishment!!! 

I got one! 

Not allowed to take another Hiatus until after the 1,000,000 GET!
I looked back over everything that happened, I can understand now why you'd be frustrated or upset.  Maniac's get was 6 seconds, had you not been confused - it would have been your get (you'd been getting consistant 3-4 second replies for a few hundred counts prior)

Just know that nobody did anything intentionally wrong - it was a mistake, could have happened to anyone.

If it were me with this GET I'd ask them to put your name on it in the Hall of Fame - because judging from that 6 second lapse in time - it would have been yours had you not been confused by the missing 998 - added later.

Anyhow - 1 GET is probably kind of big for you now - but in the long run I don't think it will be... hopefully you can chalk this up to - this sub not being perfect like most everything else in life.

Oh and congrats on being #16 counter of all time!! Movin' on up!

**HUG**

WhitneyIt's ok hun!!! You made a mistake, had it been at any other moment in time but that precise one - nobody would have ever even noticed it... don't blame yourself for not being perfect.  We all make mistakes - more often then we can count!Oh don't take a break (at least not a long one) over this... I see 20,000 - 30,000 counts go by without incident often.  This was just a fluke really - the GET should go to Xeam in my opinion though - that 6 second reply tells that Xeam would have gotten it for sure if not for the simple mistake.**Clan of the Cave Bear** - Jean Aul - 

one of the best fiction books of-all-time.

**Still Me** - Christopher Reeve.  

This book totally changed my life, it was impossible for me to feel sorry for myself for anything I was going through.  Compared to what he had to endure.  He goes into graphic detail about everything he has to go through on a daily basis.

If you feel sorry for yourself, or things you go through in life, I *highly* recommend this book!

If you've ever thought to yourself "Slavery was long ago, move on" - or "Why is it ok to have a Black History month, or Black Miss America" etc - if you've ever had a question you can't ask because you'll be thought of or called a racist... this book will change your life!A lazy eye is one that doesn't always look in the same place as the other one.  Kids with a lazy eye get teased alot in school, so if you didn't get teased alot for having one, I'd doubt that you have one.

Message me if you have an email address and I'll send you a copy.Yes, it can be totally hot.. but it's not something you should try until you've been together for a while (3-6 months at least) and have a 'safe word' - just in case you do something that scares her or go a bit too far.

A safe word should be something she'd never say  during sex normally... like grapefruit or republican for example.

If you try this way to early in a relationship - first month or two - you may find yourself doing 10 behind bars.  Unlikely -but possible - you have to be able to trust your partner, and know their signals etc.539,252

Thinking I'm going to start counting one day a week... can't hurt.

539,254

aaaaaaaaand I'm counting - WOOHOO

539,256

have to get the hang of this though!!539,258

ok!! sweet dreams!

well my counting experience was pretty short lived!

Well since I've been in a similar situation - about to be hit by a train...

I can say - every second is like an hour - and in that minute you'll have a whole lot of thoughts.

My # 1 thought at the time however was:

This is going to hurt!!!

OK story time:

Years ago - I was on the other side of the state - took my 9 year old son to a park to have lunch.

Some guy (who I found out later liked the way I looked in my jeans - so he wanted to keep me around) wanted to show my son the fish spawning.  He was taking him onto this train tressel in the middle of the river.

I said no way - what if a train shows up - he shows me the tall growth of the grass on the rails and says he's lived there 15 years and there's never been a train on this track. Keep arguing.

So he convinces me and we get in the middle of the trestle... I hear a train whistle. He continues calmly chatting - so I think nothing of it.  Several seconds later I hear another train whistle.

I start to say "I sure hope that trains not on this track" - about halfway through the sentence - the train comes from around the corner and is right there.

He and my son take off running *towards* the train!!! WTF? 

I take a huge step trying to grab my son to go away from the train... instead I lose my footing and my kneecap crashes into a spike.  I feel no pain but when I try to stand I can't move.

So I'm watching as my son looks at me, and then at the train that's about to hit him. He jumps. The guy who convinced me this was an abandon track - grabs me and throws me off and I land on that same knee on the rocks below.

But in those seconds - every second seemed like an hour - so many thoughts.  But mostly "This is going to hurt!!"

This brilliant man now claimed my leg was *not* broken... so three times I tried to stand - three times I passed out from the pain. Because of the idiot causing me to put weight on it 3 times - it messed my knee up pretty bad.

Here's a funny part of this story though - I was a bit delirious from pain - and I kept saying "I thought it was a real train!!"

It was just engine - one car and a caboose.

So in my mind I thought I was going to get hit by a "real" train - ie 20 car train.  As if getting hit by the engine wouldn't have "hurt" - or killed my butt. 

This was in fact an abandoned track - but once a year they did a maintance run... I just happened to be there the one minute of the year they were going to be on that trestle!

EDIT: Forgot to mention for over a decade afterwords - I could hear trains all the time. I'd lived in my home for 9 years never heard a train - but after this happened I heard several a day.  Every time for the first few years, it brought back that feeling I had when I was laying there looking at a train coming at me.  

&gt; I dumped their ass like they were a red-hot cannonball.

the TL;DR:

Previous abuse, extreme low self esteem, a shrinking support system, belief that they will change, the honeymoon period, finances, children, fear he'll kill himself or her.

Doesn't sound like you left after the first signs or the first physical abuse yourself?

It's extremely complicated... almost all women who get involved in an abusive relationship were abused or controlled as children.  They tend to have rock bottom self esteems - even if they are a 10.  

Most of the time it starts out very gradually - and often as time goes on they lose their support system, friends, family etc.

By the time it gets to the point that it's obvious you should leave, they are often in love and believe that the person they saw when they were being seduced into the relationship - is the man he really is.  That this abusiveness isn't how he 'really is'

Each time - they make promises and convince the person they will change.

The longer this goes on the less outside support - help they usually have - people judge/blame them for allowing the abuse and the person starts to blame themselves for the abuse as well.

Each time the abuse tends to be a little worse - and each time the abuser says / does something else to convince them it'll be different now.

Very often the man will say he'll kill himself if she leaves - she loves him and doesn't want to be the cause of his death.  Often times she's afriad he'll kill her if she leaves. (happens all the time in the USA - you are safe when you leave, until they believe it's over forever - then it's extremely dangerious)


Quite often the woman ends up stuck for financial reasons - having to chose between him and his 'changing' - or being on the streets.
 
Very often - the woman will have a child believing it'll make things better - or just to have someone in their life who will love them without abusing them.  

Once there are children involved its really hard to  leave, and even harder to stay away because they have to see the abuser for visitation and thus another opporunity to convince her to give him another chance.

In my case - I dealt with 9 yrs of verbal abuse - but the first time he ever hit me - I told him if he ever did it again I'd leave.  He did and I left forever.  Worse mistake ever - if I had it all to do over again, I would have left once during those years of verbal abuse.  The extreme situation I found myself in because I wouldn't give him a '2nd chance' - put me through absolute hell for a couple of years.

So I personally recommend leaving once early on - and then for *good* the 2nd time he ever gets physical.  

Anyhow - it's extremely complicated - I just touched on a few of dozens of reasons and causes why women stay.

It's so funny I see this constantly when it comes to black lives matter...

and yet in my *entire* life - I have never seen anyone ever say anything to people being activist for other things...

Never seen someone say 

Heart disease matters!!! at a Cancer walk or fund  raiser.

Never seen anyone say Lung Cancer matters!!! at a Breast Cancer fund raiser or walkathon.

Never seen anyone shouting what about the floods on the east coast!!! at a "hurricane help center"

I could list 1000 different causes that I've *never* seen anyone take issue with or shout for their specific cause at the other cause.

I think it's pretty telling that I see people taking issue with "Black lives matter" - all over the internet.


Black lives do matter - anyone who takes issue with people saying this - are total hypocrits because they do NOT take issue with those saying "cancer patience matter" or "Hurricane victims matter" etc.

I **challenge** you to find me two instances - *ever* where someone stepped into someone else's cause and took issue with it - or argued that it took away from all the ther serious issues or causes that exist.

I'll wait....At the top is the clitoris - just below that the urethra (where women pee from) just below that the vagina (where you stick your penis in) below that the anus.

Here's a really good picture for you to look at (NSFW I suppose... nothing dirty about the female anatomy though)

http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/biology-of-the-female-reproductive-system/female-external-genital-organs&gt; You don't direct away from the original cause. You scope out. You become more general and cover a larger audience. Why would you not want to save more people?

Ok - I like your very civil tone!! Not the norm in these type convo's!

**The TL;DR** 

Instead of hijacking someone else's cause - the thousands complaining about the "BLM" movement - could effect change if they actually DID something besides complaining and taking issue with the "BLM" - they should not be forced to take up everyone else's causes - and I've yet to see *any* other cause being bashed so much for not doing so.

---



So it's extremely complicated and I can't cover 1% of it... but let me share a few things:


You said:

"What is happening is people are looking at the facts. They notice that it isn't just black people who are being killed. It's blacks, whites, asians, mexicans, everyone. PEOPLE. ALL LIVES MATTER. We don't need to be killing each other period."

Yes. Yes. Yes.

Here's the thing though - how many white people (or Asian etc) are taking an *active* role in trying to end police killing of unarmed innocent people?  

Compare that to the # of them - who speak up whenever they hear "Black lives matter"

Those who do care about the police violence against everyone - should be spending their time trying to do something about it - not spending their time discussing - putting down those who say "Black lives matter"

Take up the cause yourself - don't try to hijack another race's cause.

Black people have learned very well over the decades that things won't change unless they become activists and try and force a change. 

If white people are genuinely concerned with the white / asian etc unarmed boys getting killed by police - than why is it I never heard a single word about it ever until the "Black lives matter" movement started.  Now suddenly they are taking issue with those activist - because "All lives matter" but they don't do anything to effect change... they just critize and take issue with the wording of the movement started by another race.

I know of 1000's of different causes - and issues - this is the first one I can recall where thousands of people all over the internet are taking issue with the wording of a cause.  Why do you think that is?

Most agree they should have used different phrasing "Black lives matter TOO" - but it's also evident that many many people are intentionally rewording a very specific set of words to mean "ONLY Black lives matter" - why intentionally change the actual words to fit a narrative?  

TO me this honestly seems racist (subconsciously perhaps)  - they didn't say "ONLY Black lives matter"  

They are saying our boys are getting gunned down in the streets at an alarming level.... and they want to see something change.

If in fact white people (asian or what-have-you) want to see the police murders stop - instead of rewording another race's cause to make it look bad - why don't they spend their time and energy actually doing something to make change? How much is that happening - compared to the time they spend putting down the "Black lives matter (too)" cause?

The biggest problem the movement has - is that it allowed itself to be associated with the "Hands up don't shoot" (ie a criminal who'd tried to steal a gun) - this set them back so far... because unfortunately so many don't want to look beyond that and realize all the many other cases where this movement needed to happen because of.


Eric Gardner for example - they chocked him to death over lose cigerrettes - if this is happening to whites, why haven't we seen that?

The little boy who had a toy gun and they shot him within two seconds of pulling up - instead of keeping their distance and trying to resolve the situation?  I just haven't seen this with little white boys on my news channels.

It's amazing having such a civilized convo about this!! You are very articulate!  I agree with sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much of what you said in your brief (hehe) comment. Almost everything - and some of it is sooooo spot on.

But I'm going to address a few things I disagree with or would like to have you concider...

&gt;The other aspect is that many of these interactions go bad because the person being stopped wants to be stupid. So now if you break that down and realize that the amount of times that a bad police officer has done something to someone who doesn't deserve it, it is actually quite low.

This one!!!

I can't possibly tell you how many times I've seen someone say something similiar to this over the past year.

"If they'd stop resisting, not run, or stop acting up, etc"

Being STUPID, acting up, resisting arrest, running etc are NOT - absolutely NOT capital punishment acts.  Unless an officer or the public's lives are in danger - an officer should NOT be judge - jury and instant EXECUTIONER.

You said:

"done something to someone who doesn't deserve it" - 

those who deserve to be shot ON THE SPOT - deserve it.  That's not what we are addressing here.  But so often I hear whenever someone brings up bad cops murdering unarmed black boys &amp; men - I hear comments such as those.  Implying if they deserve to be shot ON THE SPOT with no judge, no jury, no sentence. Dead. Forever. Because they ran because they were rightly scared? Because they acted a fool? Because they didn't obey the officer.  Not obeying is NOT something you should be shot DEAD for.

Unfortunately it takes away from what's really happening to blame the victims in these cases to take away from the bad cops who murder people and the bad cops who cover up for them or don't join with us to try to get them removed from the force.



Now as far as you making it sound like the majority of people who take issue with the "Black lives matter" movement are genuinely caring about it?  Are you aware of how many *thousands* of times in the past year whenever blacks bring up the fact that their unarmed boys are being gunned down by police at an alarming rate - INSTANTLY say "If you care about black lives - why aren't you doing something about black-on-black murders in your communities" 

Does this sound like people trying to "work with them" and "on the same team" etc?  No.  They are trying to take away from this movement to stop police executioners for "resisting" or "selling cigs" - by bringing up a completely different issue and suggesting because of that OTHER issue - they are being hypocritcal by trying to stop those hired to serve and protect from killing them!!

As far as the news and the media - they are as crooked as they come - anything *anything* to make money.   

For every Jon Bennett Ramsey there are a dozen black girls that go missing that barely even make the local news.

The only reason black boys getting shot are making the news this year - is because it sells advertising space!!

Anyhow - this has been an interesting and educational convo... 

I'll leave it with this:

Suggesting they "deserve" to be shot dead without a judge and jury or legal representation for anything short of being a threat to the officer or public - is horrible and contributes to the mindset of those bad cops believing as they do..

Taking "Black lives matter" to mean "ONLY Black lives matter" - is deceptive and agenda driven.

Suggesting people don't care about blacks killing blacks when discussing with "Black lives matter" is unfair and again takes away from doing something to stop these bd cops from killing unarmed boys for being scared and not instantly becoming obeying robots.

You can have the last word!!  Thanks for the civil convo!

**HUG**

I don't know - but I think for most school shooters they want to die and want to make a name for themselves on their way out.  And our Media glorifies them so they get their final wish at the expense of childrens lives - but making more ad revenue is more important than not glorifying these killers. Thus encouraging more.

So I'd imagine they aren't there to kill as many as they possibly can - just enough to make a name for themselves and make those who hurt/bullied/dumped them pay via these subsitutes.

I think the Columbine shooters were the exception - they wanted a really high body count - hence the bombs they planted.

The rest of these shooters - I think they just want to kill enough to get their names and stories in front of a national audience and they know that doesn't require a high body count.

Just my thoughts - don't have the answer.Can only speak for myself..

breastfeeding didn't cause any sexual sensation (ie .. arousal) it's extremely painful at first - and by the time it's not your breasts are pretty desensitized. 

As far as if they still cause arousal with your partner - for me I didn't really like it while breastfeeding... but after I had stopped - it was still very arousing for my partner to suck, tease them.  Don't know about anyone else but for me - age has made it not nearly as arousing for my partner to suck/play with them.

&gt; Does the desensitization ever stop?

Can only speak for myself - I breastfeed longer than most women (almost 2 yrs)

It took about two years after I stopped breastfeeding  before I noticed them being really sensative and sexually arousing again. They were pretty much back to the way they were pre-breastfeeding after 3 years.

Now though (40+) it doesn't really do anything for me to have my nips teased / sucked at all.  Don't know if that's normal or rare though.There's actually another exercise a woman can do that tightens things up even better and much more noticable.

Laying on one's side and doing leg lifts slowly -  while tightening that area... about 20 reps on each side.  Surprisingly though - I've never really read about this.  I learned this from my sister-in-law years ago. It works so well that without having told my hubby I'd done them - he noticed immediately the next time we had sex - the first time I did them.I hear what you are saying - if you'd like a better understanding as to why they aren't comparable.

If you've ever asked yourself "Why is it ok to have a Black Miss America, or a Black History month..." etc 

I can recommend this book - it'll really open your eyes and make it so much less frustrated when dealing with and understanding black people.

It's called:

Yup men who were raised to believe it's not manly to cry - continue this with their own kids.

And they wonder why there is an epidemic of boys / young men committing suicide in the USA?

REAL MEN CRY! It's natural - we are born crying and many of us go out crying... in between "real men don't show emotion" - no some bottle it up and it manifest in being abusive to their partners or turning to drugs.Seems to me - here in the good-ole-USA they are just teaching them now how to NOT be kids - they start drugging them for acting like kids in kindergarten now! 

Oh how many studies have been done to deterimine the long term effects of giving millions of children Ritilan at such a young age. 

Seems interesting that as the oldest of this group are coming of age, meth is becoming an epidemic in many cities and towns all across America.
Sigh.A message from the two non moderators.oh aren't you all fancy in your *green* username!turned it on

turned it off

too many colors!

I'm sure you are not alone in feeling like this - and I am sure it applies to alot of other situations as well.

If I were in your shoes though - I'd really consider finding someone to talk to about it - if you can't see a therapist - perhaps someone online?

Here's one possible resource until you find a better alternative...


https://www.7cupsoftea.com/There are many different kinds of love, and many different degrees of love.

I'll answer it as to how it relates to your last paragraph....

Just finding someone sexy doesn't really mean you "love them" - so no I don't think you'd call a friend you find sexy someone you "love"

Pretty much when you fall in love - you'll know it.  It's kind of indescribable - but most likely you will know it when it happens.

Some things that may happen (but not all of these - and not in all cases)

In the beginning:

You think about them all the time...

You miss them when they are gone...

You really enjoy being with them and spending time with them...

You really like certain things about them - their smile - their voice - the way they smell - their laugh - things like that.

When you think about losing them (not being able to spend time with them / be with them) it hurts. An actual physical pain in the chest sometimes. 

You don't want them to be with someone else...

Usually you are physically attracted to them - no matter how good looking others might find them...

Usually when they touch you (Anywhere) you get a feeling - perhaps a tingle or warm fuzzy feeling...

Most of these are more prevalent at the beginning of the relationship and as I said - not all apply.

Hope that helps.18 is pretty young!  Some girls aren't ready for sex at that age.

Its possible she seems to have no attraction to sexual activities because she doesn't want to start something she's not ready to finish. Or because she doesn't want to lead you on. Or because she's terrified.  It can be pretty scary prior to your first time.

I will say however and please listen to this:

Do **not** marry her - until you are sure you are sexually compatible. IE have at least somewhat compatible sex drives.  

If you have any doubts about me being right on this... spend a few hours in the sub /r/DeadBedrooms and you'll see what your future holds if she ends up just not being into sex - a 24/7 nightmare. Instead of what's likely going on - age and fear etc.

I imagine you don't realize this but for a girl - losing her virginity can a be very very scary idea. Be patient.  Each month try to introduce something more to your sexual relationship - while making sure she knows you are *not* expecting her to go 'all the way'

Examples of things to gradually introduce... 

washing each other in the shower... with a bit of extra washing of certain areas. 

sensual messages

spooning nakid or with her just in her panties... (let her know you'll be hard as a brick and it's gonna be OK - be sure to masturbate prior to trying this one for the first or 10th time LOL)

texting each other a naughty story about some sexual experience you'd like to have someday...

things like this... just always assure her that you are not expecting *more* at this time.



There are so many levels of depression - someone who's never experienced the hell of an extreme depression -  don't realize that when they say they suffer from depression they are referring to something not so severe.

But part of the reason there are so many people suffering from depression here - is because it's kind of a magnet for depressed people. A way to - even if it's just a tiny bit - take your mind off of the insanity of the 5000 thoughts a second you normally have. 

When someone says "I suffer from depression" - that tells you very little about their condition.  Could be they are having a bad week/month and are not as happy as normal.  Could be that they spend every waking moment (dealing with it **86,400** seconds a day)  - so desperate to die - that it's completely unbearable.  

Someone saying they suffer from depression - should not lose its credibility just because there are different levels of depression... could be that person you brush off or ignore - may be at their very last straw. And you could save a life (or 7... since they have 7 vital organs that can one day save 7 other people)

 Awesome!! Glad I was able to help.

I'm going to repeat something though - because it's pretty important I think.  It's really not enough to say once in a while "I'm not going to pressure you to go all the way" - pretty much every time you want to do something sexual in nature with her, you should say something like that - otherwise she'll be afraid to join in - or enjoy what's going on because she is afraid it'll make you want to go further. (also - I'm sure you know masturbating before any of these types of activities will help you not feel so frustrated and be able to enjoy them more)

Good luck - save my name and send me a wedding invite in a few years!!!

**HUG**

How about Travon Martins murderer - I'll plant a bag of skittles next to the body and claim I had NO possible choice but to get out of the security of my 2000 lbs suit of protection (ie car) with a loaded gun... and had to stand my ground, once I got OUT of my car to have ground to stand on.

If I'm going out - I'd be happy to take this lowlife  scum of the earth with me.  My 2 cents?

When is the last time you have seen someone bring up a *positive* or uplifting statistic about minorities on Reddit? I have been on Reddit over 2 years and don't recall ever seeing one.

Usually when a statistc or fact involving a minority is mentioned - it's to show something negative or degrading etc... if that person were to mention a postitive statistic and a negative one - doubt they'd be called a racist.  

Another thing - statistics about minorities tend to be very biased and do rarely take into consideration many many things that relate to those statistics.  Many statistics about minorities - when vetted - tell a completely different story.  Not taking that into consideration when blindly telling 'facts' without knowing the actual reality behind those stats - can be racists... because it paints that race with an inaccurate and broad brush.



Just ask yourself this:

How many times have I seen  a negative statistic about _______ (you name it... how often have you done seen *that* stat?)

vs.

How many times have I seen a negative statistic about minorities?

I've probably seen at least 200 mentions of black on white crime stats... and black on black crime rates on Reddit.  Don't recall seeing a single mention of White-on-White crime rates on Reddit (except rarely when using it to show how much worse black crime rate is...)  

Women commit murder too - how many times have you seen statistics on that on Reddit?  

Next time you ever see a statistic used in regards to minority on reddit that is *positive* send me a PM... till then realize the reason it seems racist is because using stats and facts in regards to race, is almost always to point out something negative not positive about that race.

The way stats are twisted and manipulated is a fascinating study that I'd recommend spending some time on - if you wish to use stats in regards to something negative about another race.




I actually started this thread - but couldn't quite figure out how to explain my idea - so I deleted it (or so I thought)

The idea was something along the lines of - Person posts some obscure # - person who figures out what it means  - ie correct responder posts another obscure # and so it goes from there...

It won't let us post new comments - soooooo don't think this will last long - but we can work out the kinks here and see if it's worth starting a new thread.&gt; my wounds are fresh.

Most of us have been there! It really helps to focus only on the negatives when you are dwelling on it.  Thinking about the positives does not help you in *any* way.  Unless she was a perfect saint - there had to be bad times and bad situations etc - focus on those until the wounds start to heel.  

And as much as you may miss her - and want her back - realize if it hadn't happened now, it's very likely it would a years from now... with kids (or more kids) involved - more of your 'best years' gone etc.

Also try and focus on the fact that if you found her - you can find someone else - and there's a chance that person will make you happier!

Just try to be careful about being someone who is likely a good catch in the near future - quick rebound relationships are almost always doomed.  Try to avoid getting close to good catches until you can go a few days at a time without thinking about the gal who broke your heart.

&gt; 'She's getting banged by someone else right now' 


No. No. No.

She's on the first day of her period - with cramps and a super headache to go with it... trust me!&gt; 2.718281828

from what I could find this is "Euler's number" 

Ahh from more research - I say I got this one right:

2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995  

Perfect match. 
way to complicated for me to figure out what the heck it means though!

Is this the correct answer?
7.3 million


##**CONGRATS!!**

You are 130ish away from TOP 5!!Um ya I'd definately settle for being in the TOP 3 (like most competitive events) - because you'd have to be a mad man for trying to stay ahead of rs!!  I can't see him giving up his #2 spot in the next century LOL.

Personally if it were me - I'd be totally fine being in the TOP 10 in a 3 1/2 year old competition!! That's huge!&gt; 2023rd????

I don't like that number!

I'll have to go for 2020 - like that #.

How do I tell how many I need to move up 3 spots?

Is it customary to combine counts from your other username? 

I'd rather just stick with the counts from this name - if that's possible

Had to scroll for a # I like - 1100 will do the trick! 

Actually I want to end up in the top 500 at some point...;)  So I have a bit of counting to do!!This is the first time I've ever seen this complete chart - had no idea it even existed!!

Took me a while to find me on there LOL.  I just have to do 83 counts to be in the top 500... that should be easy enough to do.

Does anyone have a total count of the # of counters listed on there?I knew it was over 7000 - didn't realize it's approaching 8000! I have encouraged alot of people to count once to add their names to the history books though - so not surprised.

I wish I was good at math (I am about a 4th grade level when it comes to math - great at alot of things just not that) because statistics and compiling this info - interested me alot.

I just have to rely on rs to help me with getting the info I want here LOL.

Prior to tonight - I wasn't aware there was a list beyond the 600 list I've checked many times.  This list is going on my toolbar!

EDIT: I do intend to be in the TOP 500 though.  That's good enough for me!##**CONGRATS!!**

You are now one of the TOP 100 counters of all time!



Now that you are in the TOP 100 - you can check the regular chart instead of that 7,800+ people chart!

https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=100

Here's the chart I was reading when I noticed you were just 3 away... if you are curious:

https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=10000

(You'll be added to that first one I mentioned when rs updates it)

That list only list the top 25 - the one I gave ~~her~~ him lists the  top 100.

https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=100

sorry /u/rideride typo - he's definately a manly-man!&gt; I'm so happy you're one of us now!

Me too!! I'm going for the TOP 500 counters - 83 counts to go...I'm gonna count on Sundays (my BF doesn't come over till after 3:00 on Sundays) - so I should have no problem getting the 83.

Not going to set a goal after the 500 though... way to many #'s and time involved to get to the top 200 or whatever.

500 works for me!

I'm bummed listening to you guys talking about the music on your computers... I used to have 100's of awesome music on mine.  But unless I buy some speakers for my laptop - there's no point in listening to music on it... at top volume it's not even easy to hear music or talking on here.


Do you guys have any idea how often I read through the days comments and wonder who's passing the bong???? 

This convo belongs in /r/trees not /r/counting!!!!&gt; Short strings of random characters until one I liked

You got me wondering how others pronounce your username...

most the time when I think of you or refer to you it's rs  r-s  but when I think of your user name in my head it sounds like this:

R - ra - shod

(not even close to your actual username but after the first time I tried to pronounce it - I went with R - ra - shod and that's how it's always been ever since)Interesting!! I'm betting everyone here says it in their head (pronounces it) different!

Mine isn't even close to his actual spelling - but it's the first thing I came up with so it stuck... I'll always think of him as "R ra shod"  (shod as it's pronounced in shoddy)while you two are talking about Atom - Atom and I are talking about rs elsewhere in this thread...scroll back a bit and see!

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments&gt; The amount of coincidences

Speaking of coincidences - did you happen upon that BBC article from the link I gave you a little while ago for the TIDBITS thread which mentions it? Or was it from you doing a google search? 

This sub was also mentioned on Mashable.com - a pretty mainstream site.

I emailed them in regards to the 500,000 but it was a bit too late for them to do anything with it.  For the 1,000,000 I'll email them a couple weeks ahead of time.That's funny then - because in the last hour I gave you a link to the TIDBITs thread - in which that BBC article is mentioned... and then shortly after - you mention the article!

World gets smaller every day when you are online!Just noticed your edits in the TIDBITs thread - too funny... 

You are missing something though:

5) Best moment was probably getting unbanned. 

should say

5) Best moment was probably getting ~~unbanned.~~ unbanned again!

P.S. Unless you have the TIDBITs thread bookmarked - I find the fastest way to get there is via the top of the FTF thread.I just noticed your first number here was a palidrome!! Well it *is* your first # and it *is* a palidrome.  I'm sure since somewhere in the first 3,000 we've been "behind" - doesn't mean someones first # isn''t their first # right?

So basically the way you are looking at it - nobody's first # is actually their first # - even if it is in fact the first number they counted here in /r/counting - because technically *every* number here is not correct... even if just one # was missed in the past 540,000 numbers.

I don't see how you can say that the first number you typed here was 207,702 but it wasn't in fact the first # you typed here?  Seems pretty black and white to me - you pressed those 6 #'s on your keyboard - to later say you didn't in fact type those six numbers here as your first number - doesn't make much sense to me.

Perhaps it's just the verbage we are using isn't connecting.

As far as claiming it as some sort of 'sub palidrome' - when it wasn't correct in the current count adjustment makes sense... but to say the number 207,702 is not a palidrome and it wasn't in fact the first number you counted here - is confusing me!

But I'll let you have the last word!

*HUG*
Well my best moment here so far was you getting unbanned the *2nd* time - you are part of our family here!

I would have been upset for a very long time had you not come back!Here's my thoughts on this - 

I think you could put a few hundred hours into trying to make it perfect (from comment #1) and it still would not be perfect... I've spent probably 20 hours in the first 12,000 comments - it's beyond description as to it's messiness and cluster-fuck.  

Is there anyone but you who cares that the count is absolutely perfect through out years of counting and almost 8,000 counters?

Since it'd be next to impossible to completely make it perfect - and you'd have to change everyone else's work they've done through the years... seems like it'd be rs's count not a collaborative effort of 7,800 people?  

I mean do you plan on changing other peoples #'s? Deleting others #'s? Etc?  

Honestly - I can think of at least a dozen things you could do for this sub - that'd make a much, much bigger difference. And effect alot more people, and make alot of people here's time more pleasant etc.... with the time it'd take to try and make the count "perfect"  - is what you are planning to do going to make everyone who has ever counted here no longer be able to consider their first # - their first #?

How many people will personally benefit from that time and effort - as opposed to other awesome things you could do for this sub that many would benefit from... perhaps for years to come.

I have several ideas on things you can do for us - just waiting because I know you've been busy...

Anyhow - it's just something to consider. Well I'm taking about how it was on *our* side of things... I saw your first ban, just a couple of curious comments.... you did notice a difference this time I hope!  *Everyone* immediately got involved in getting you unbanned.  Everyone wanted you back!  I did everything I possible could to ensure you'd be back... (not taking credit for you being unbanned - everyone spoke up and everyone did what they could to get you back!)

I've seen many of the oldies here say that things have gotten alot more personal and family oriented the past year... so perhaps that's why this time you staying banned would have been drastically different.

I'd love to tell you my reaction to your banning at first but you'd probably think I'm a nut! I did *not* take it well! 

But then I realized me freaking out wasn't going to help fix this - so I had to calm down and start doing what I could to help make it happen! 



But I based on the fact you kept involved and in touch with people here etc during those 14 months clearly tells me that the sub was pretty important to you even back then!

You are special - and you are special to all of us - don't forget that!!



Well we can discuss this more later - but I see no possible way to make the count perfect without completely changing the collaborative efforts of thousands done over thousands and thousands of hours.

Every single # since the first missed # that was not corrected would have to be edited... because they are technically incorrect #s.  Every GET, every assist, every palidrome ever would no longer be valid.  The only way to redo all those missing comments would be for a different person to enter each one or you'd be breaking the most funamental rule here - no double counting.  

If the intent of all those who started this count was for it to be perfect - they would have had to give up in the first 1000#'s and none of us would be here today - discussing changing history and possibly invalidating 500,000+ counts because they were not "correct" 

You seem pretty dead set on this however - hopefully you can find a way to do this without invalidating the other 7,800 who've contributed here's count. 

I'm a bit confused if me counting here on Sundays has a point - if every # I count is going to be considered wrong and not a valid count because in the year 2012 someone missed a count...therefore every count since has been wrong.

I just wonder if one person making the decision to change things for 7,800 people makes a ton of  sense...



EDIT: Anyhow - I'm off to sleep g'nite hun! **HUG**I'm sorry james - had I known our side convo was going to continue for so many comments and clutter up the counting screen so much I would have taken the discussion to PMs (I'll be more aware in the future) 

Sweet dreams!

**HUG**

Whitney##**CONGRATS!!**

You did fool me! I read comments here from bottom to top and when I saw your 

brb 10 min

at 540,998 - I was like WTH???

I like you adding TOP 100 to your flair!!I like your idea pixel - thought about it -  I think it'd make sense to make my plan 10 counts a day - instead of unlimited once a week.  

For a variety of reasons, but especially since I'll get to count with alot more different people this way! Also because I'll get my name on alot more of rs's participation charts!



541,225

Welcome to the sub /u/camelhumpsaresexy 

For those wondering why I'm now going to be a counter here - I've decided that I can count 10 counts a day from now on!  But I'm still the subs #1 cheerleader!!541,227

Awww hug!!541,229541,231541,233

sorry camel541,235541,239541,241

Going great! You?541,244541,246

aaaaaaaaaaand I'm done!

camel - sorry I'm new to actually counting here too - should be a bit easier with just the two of you counting now!

**HUG**

Whitney &gt; proposal: save 543 210 for whitney

Awww that's sweet hun.... but I'm hoping Atom gets it to go with his other biggies the 234,567 etc...

Now I'm off to do my 10 counts for the day! 543,025

aaaaaaaaaand I'm counting woohoo!!543,027

Howdy *river*!!
543,030

That's ok blue - if it is up to me I say give it to Atom to go with his other biggies like the 234,657543,035

Ride - I don't know what happened I typed in the # but it didn't "take" so had to do an edit... still getting the hang of this counting lol543,037



I know it's pretty weird feeling myself, after seeing 150,000+ counts, having my name in it when I check the page is odd!!

blue - snipe away - all the big #'s are fair game - think its sweet that you and rs were willing to give it up for me though ... awww :)543,039

was waiting for blue - not sure how to do a 3 person rotation yet...543,043

Howdy Manaic - so glad Pixel gave me this suggestion - 10 a day means I get to count with lots of different people!&gt; 1000 comments

Yup there was a lot of chit-chat in this thread - so much so we actually irritated james543,045

Hence my slipery slope reason for not counting... I'm gonna stick with 10 - I think it's a great idea!!

Howdy rs - fancy counting with you!543,047

should I save count #10 for the attempt at the 543,210 - naaa I'll have no luck against Maniac he can get 1 second response times - I'm working on 5 seconds!543,049

Ok - I'm gonna try for it what the hell - hoping Atom gets it but if not hopefully me!!

I think I'm at 9 now soooo - see you at the finish line!!##**CONGRATS!!**

I had no luck - on my screen I had to hit "continue this thread" by the time I did that - way to late!

It's ok - if you hadn't got it someone else would have!

I'm not really here for GETs - but love rooting other people on for them! Especially when one of those I brought here got the 400,000! That was too cool!

BTW - I posted something to you earlier that you probably missed - check your inbox about 30 #'s ago! Please use the DontCareILoveIt in the stats and stuff... Thanks!I am sooooooooooooo not buying it blue - selling any bridges??I have an idea - a Hall of 500's - hopefully one that people won't try for during times we have an influx of newbies (when mentioned in other subs etc) 

For those who GET 500 counts in a k... I think there are two of you with that stat at this time?Actually I just noticed that - a 4 second reply got it... I tried for it but on my screen it said "continue this thread" - I am still learning how to do this, I think I should have hit permalink a few numbers earlier? Is that how that's done to avoid the 'continue next thread' thing?
Yup now that I realize a permalink a few #'s before the GET would have helped, I had it copied and ready to go... but when I hit refresh to put it in - I had to continue next thread soooooooo... anyhow it's all good, I'm not that interested in getting the GETs myself but I do like it when others do! I wanted Atom to get it because he's gotten two other sequential #'s like it already!

and rs got Pixel's palidrome - heads are gonna roll!!

Won't be long now and you'll be in the TOP 10 counters of all time! Probably in the next week or  two! 

You and Atom's k competition at this point is making this sub alot more interesting!

Happy counting - 

FYI I'll put a bid on the bridge your selling - keep me informed!

**HUG**

WhitneyLOL!

You are amazing!  

I am thinking - 'if you build it they will come" - 

"if you ask for it, rs will build it"

You should keep that stat handy somewhere - it'll probably encourage some counters to count more to try to get on this list! 

I could of sworn someone else got 500 just recently - since the 500k but I don't think your stats can be wrong so I must be mistaken.
Thinking you should change your flair now that your in the TOP 5!!

EDIT: Have you noticed everyone's now calling you riverride? instead of /u/rideride LOLWow! That's alot of 400+ counts!  

Turns out it was Xeam I was thinking of - didn't realize he missed by 1 # - now I want to go back and see who "stole" his 1 # but you could probably tell me that in the time it took me to find the thread...

did you happen to notice someone was not so happy with us rambling on and on in the counting thread the other night?  oooops!I figured you could find it quicker than I could find the thread - thanks!

/u/bluesolid - you are brutal!!!sssssssssssssomebody has alot of editing to do!!!##\#**Blameblue!!**##**Congrats!!**

Was considering trying for a snipe for Atom - but I couldn't do that to you, not after you offered to lemme have the 543,210!!

**HUG**

~~2~~ 3 more?rs - blue and ride both ignored your mistake - blue for 100+ counts... start plotting your revenge!!!Thanks - don't know how I missed that!

Please do a participation chart for the last k - would love to have my name in one with more than one #!!

Have fun changing 150+ counts... you could probably write a program to fix them faster than doing them one by one LOL!

G'nite hun!!&gt;  it should always end with 0

The number my 10 counts end with just depends on which # I start with and how many number I end up missing in between the 1st and last number.

first count - started with 25 and ended at 46

second count - started at 25 and ended at 49

(I noticed both started at 25 - odd!)

So it won't matter if I count 10 times or 12... the number I end on will vary no matter what!

**HUG**

WhitneyThat's a tad confusing - I looked at the chart - I am currently at 31 counts.  So I'll count 9 today and from then on I should stay at a multiple of 10 (40, 50, 60 etc)

544,525

aaaaaaaaand I'm counting - howdy Atom!544,527

Howdy Pixel!544,529

Doing great - just got back from my Wednesday Bingo - won twice!544,535544,539

Howdy blue!544,543

So many counters - this is c-c-c-confusing!!!544,549

Spiffy # there Smart 544,544!544,554544,556

aaaaaaaaand I'm done for the day - my # should remain at X0 from now on Pixel if I did this right!

**HUG**

WhitneyNo problem, I have little quirks nearly identical to yours!!  

I am *very* bad at math, so not 100% sure I figured this out right - if I don't end with a X0 ending today I'll get it that way next time and try and keep it that way.  

I think I'll be in the top 500 in the next 5 days. Not going to be happy though, until I hit the TOP 300 counters in around 12ish days!

Happy counting hun!  

##**CONGRATS**

Just noticed you are the 2nd counter ever to make the **20,000** count club!  

There are two others trailing right behind you too!  There was a show on some guy who's been doing something similiar for 30 or 40 years...  Has an entire basketball league with different teams, different stats for each player, has complete games with the various players and teams - if I recall correctly even his real life friends/family get involved in it.  It was a really fascinating story - perhaps you can find him on google if you are interested. (don't recall the guys name but you could search for terms that might come up based on this comment)RemindMe! August 6, 2016 "is the birthday of /u/AmbassadorForThe90s545,855

aaaaaaand I'm counting!

Howdy blue!##**CONGRATS**

Did you really just snipe blue's GET? Atom will be pleased!546,012

maybe I can get some counts in - now that the run is over!

546,014

Howdy Moo!!!546,017 

Howdy zhige! Still getting used to it - boy did I pick the wrong time to start - right at the run to a k!
546,019546,022

Howdy dude!546,025

Howdy Pixel!

Well ride - I might as well keep calling you river since everyone is doing so now LOL546,027

No fun!546,035

Howdy rs!546,037

Just in time - this is #10!! 

Happy counting guys!!

**HUG**

WhitneyIf a counter is just going to delete their counts afterwords what's the point in responding to them? Don't understand why someone would bother to count here only to delete the comments afterwords every time.  Don't know about anyone else but I for one will just respond to the count prior to the counter who's deleting their counts anyways... instead of that counter who's intentionally counting only to delete them - from now on.  Just won't consider them a part of the count process.  He's literally deleted every count he's ever done here - don't know why he's even allowed to continue to do so, must have friends in high places here... I just think we should ignore those counts from now on as we do with counts that are later counts.Well it's also not against the rules to ignore comments that are just being counted to intenionally delete them in a few hours. 

He has the right to do what he wants with his comments of course - but we also have the right to ignore his counts if he's intentionally counting to delete them later.

Check his profile he's deleted every single count he's *ever* done here.Well some people care more about their pretty little profiles than they do about leaving holes in conversations on Reddit - to each their own I guess. I'd love to clean up my profile more as well especially my other one... but I don't out of courtesy for others in cases where my comment has been responded too by someone else.

Everyone has a right to do what they want on Reddit - but I just don't see a point in us responding to counts that are being made intentionally to be deleted.  Why not just ignore them like we do late comments.  

That's just my 2 cents.Ok - well I'll just avoid doing my counts at those times when someone is counting to intentionally delete them - easy enough for me to do!Great idea for a counting game skiz!  Looks like fun... wondering if the count will ever make it to -10 or 10 LOL.&gt; edit: lol at "Most recent 1000get CHAMPION" on the sidebar

Just happened upon this comment - did they really put riverride on the sidebar?  Too funny!!!Howdy BowtieMaster! Welcome!

You're the first vistor to brave counting.  Never seen such a shy group of vistors here before!Thanks for the info - doesn't surprise me with that askreddit Q.  This sub was actually rated one of the 5 strangest on the internet by the BBC a few years back!The sub just recently reached **500,000** after 3 1/2 years of counting, quite an achievement!

Here's a link to the big 500,000 GET - [500,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3olp9s/499k_counting_thread/cvyer7c?sort=top)


Over 7,800 people have added their name to the [history books](https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=10000)  - drop in and add a count!

HINT: The tradition is the new counting thread in the 54X - is started by the last person to count in the previous thread - ok - sorry if this caused you any confusion :)No no no no!!

I was just lettting you know it was an honest mistake from a newbie - the thread needed to be removed of course.  Just wanted to let you know about the visitors and why this one didn't know how these threads are done.

**HUG**I don't think you did anything wrong - not sure why you think that I said that or implied that?

Was just explaining we have visitors - so mistakes like this may be more likely tonight...

Sorry if I gave you the wrong impression hun!

Ok sorry - not at all what I meant it to sound like.

Just giving you the heads up that we had alot of newbies here tonight - not at all suggesting you should have dealt with it in a different way. I'm glad you caught this thread when you did - could have lead to alot of confusion if you weren't here!

Sorry I wrote that in a way that confused you!

Whitney

~~Hi hun - this counting idea is a good one - so good someone thought of it yesterday (so this is a duplicate thread) - here's a link to the one you can count in:~~

Edit:  After discussing this future - his idea is different - don't think it's the same as the other one I mentioned!

Here's the example he gave me:

[example](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3rqt61/counting_by_adding_or_subtracting_a_number_one/cwqhvtn)Please don't do that moon - you are awesome!~~They are identical actually - give it a shot, it's a fun thread!~~I don't understand the difference - here is a link to the start of that thread...

They are doing increments and decrements of one...

anyhow - I'm not a mod here... so I'll let you work it out with someone who is - if there is a difference I'm just not getting it.

Either way it was a great idea you had - that thread is a big hit!

**HUG**

Doesn't look like anything I've seen here - sorry for butting in... looks interesting!

Take care!!

P.S. you should put the above example in the header for others to be able to understand it better.Sorry won't work for me - I'm pretty loyal to this sub and I'm afraid /r/counting will never hit infinity without my 10 counts a day...I have dibs on the infinity assist!!There's a new one started by one of last nights visitors that looks pretty fun if you want to add it to the list:

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3rqt61/counting_by_adding_or_subtracting_a_number_one/Yup you are the man!! People are loving it and I can see why!


It's **400+** counts in a day... since you started it you'll have a some feedback in what the GET is... so you better start thinking.  (since your kind of new I'll give you a tip, consider the 1000th comment the GET)

Thanks for making such a fun thread for /r/counting!##**Welcome to our visitors!!**

We've noticed ya'all dropping in from that AskReddit thread... glad you could join us.

Try and add a count to the infinity thread while you are here to add your name to the [history books!](https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=10000)

The main thread ie "infinity thread" was started over 3 1/2 years ago and just recently hit over 500,000 counts!  

To post a count to the thread you can use the following link:

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments

Look for the highest number it'll be a six digit number something like this 546,XXX   (if you see this later on it'll probably be 547,XXX)

When you find that number click on 'context' - and give it a shot to add your #.  

If you have questions - feel free to ask here!

P.S. you can always get to the above link under Etiquette # 3 on the side bar -----&gt;


Feel free to post to any of the other types of counting threads as well - most of them have info and instructions if you click on the threads title.


Happy counting! You are currently at

##**1**

with 418 counts... so you'll have to rethink that GET strategy I am pretty sure.546,313


aaaaaaaaaand I'm counting!

Hard to find this main thread with that new counting thread flooding the new comments page... 

What a switch - usually nobody can find the side threads whenever this one goes on a run... now it's the opposite!



can you please link us to the correct one - there are 100's of comments blurring the field right now.546,322

Thanks for the link zhige!

Thanks user!!


Your dad's name is Don't? :) LOL

*number fixed whew!546,325

Had a lot of visitors here last night (still some here) nothing close to my *624 users here* though lol. Maxed out around 180.546,328

This visiting group was/is so shy though - 150+ here not one put their feet in the water for the first hour... not the norm when we have company. 

I'm pretty sure the AskReddit Redditors who read the less popular older threads (such as the one this one was in) are a bit different than those who only read the huge most recent threads and that partly explains it.546,333

They've come from a mention in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3romvd/what_is_the_strangest_subreddit_you_have_found/) thread.
546,343

Ok gotta run for a bit - will finish my count later.

**VISITORS**

Feel free to try and jump in and add a # - or are you all just here 'so you don't get fined" LOL

**Hugs**

WhitThat's funny - that's the name I coined when I was throwing a bit of a fit because a few people weren't giving anyone else a chance to count! 

Surprised to see it's turned into an actual sub! LOL
/r/ofcoursethatsathing 

Me either! Kind of an odd little sub though - who can double count the most - from what I can tell.##**CONGRATS**

You don't normally go for the k - that was a surprise.

Hopefully I can get my other 5 counts in now!

I think between those two they've done 40,000 counts - a whole lot of practice &amp; knowing where the reply button will end up after a refresh etc.  My fastest time is 6 seconds LOL547,012

aaaaaaaaaand I'm back to finish off my other 5 counts!

Howdy everyone! 

##**555,555 HYPE!!**547,016547,019

Not much - just waitin' for my BF to get here...and the **555,555** :)547,025

&gt; So are you counting your deleted count in your 10 for the day?

No - I don't think so - I counted a 5th count after that deleted one.547,044

##**UNCLE!!**

LOL guys - you are brats!!!

(~~fourth~~ ~~fifth~~ 6th try a charm??)


That's it for me today - boy was that quick!

Happy counting everyone!

**HUG**

Whitney

Edit: missed by ~~one~~ 10 second last time! 

The rate I am currently counting - I should get my final count in for the day by Turkey day..

Edit 2: WHEW! Finally - that was fun and too funny - ya'all got me in a great mood for my BF!  TaTa!

&gt; PreventWhitneyFromGettingHerLastCountIn

Thanks to your bright idea -  it took me 6 attempts to get my last count in!!!  

(was actually pretty funny - can't stop smiling)&gt; did I do something wrong?

See Etiquette item #4 (this type of thread already existed) 

Alot of people have started threads that were removed (including my first one here as a matter of fact) so don't worry yourself to much over it.

Perhaps - if in doubt ask a regular here before starting a new thread.

Have a great night!!Sorry - no gold for someone  bashing others in their profile...

Example:

"Tired of this body acceptance bullshit."

There's absolutely *nothing* wrong with that guys body and if there was it's not your business. 

Body shaming others is not ok - even if they don't look great like that guy did!

Off to find someone nice to give gold too.

Hopefully one day you'll be able to treat others the way you want to be treated... till then good luck with your life!Wondering why this one isn't marked gilded? Just not having any luck finding someone to give gold to today...giving up.

Don't like your use of the words whore, ni..er, fa..ot, etc in your post... to each their own I guess but not spending my $ on people posting derogatory stuff here on Reddit.

You are correct! Nothing against the rules.

I liked your comment in regards to your request - so I took the time to see if I wanted to spend my $ on you... I was just letting you know why I decided against it.  


Those who give out gold here are just normal people who decide to spend our $ on those who we think (for whatever our personal reasons are) should get gold.  

I'm a rather poor person and have given out over 30 gold at 4.00 a pop - I was just giving you the heads up.  Using those words aren't really benefiting your life are they? - so perhaps rethink using them.  Or not.

Anyhow - take care!You are right - I don't have time to spend a few hours reading every requesters profile before deciding... after seeing you use the n word and f word - that was enough for me. You know those words offend alot of people yet choose to use them anyways. Your choice.  But I'm very limited as to who I give gold to and so I skipped looking for all your good posts after seeing those.

Anyhow gold is only 4 bucks  - you can just buy it yourself instead of worrying about my opinion!

Have a great weekend!
You can send Reddit a postcard to get free gold for a month since you don't have a cc 

Night!##**CONGRATS!!**

Nobody even tried to snipe that one from you!

Howdy Aschebescher!

I've seen your posts in the wilds of Reddit before, don't think we've ever had a Redditor with over **1,000,000** link karma in this sub before.

Happy counting!

306 counts! Over half way to TOP 100 counters!
  

Your counts are all red (upvoted) on your profile (since I've been here) - so I've obviously seen them and you here before! 

This *is* a pretty handy way to get some comment karma - I think Nitrome just hit 80,000 comment karma from counting here!  



Happy counting hun!

**HUG**

Whitney

p.s - I think you have a *little* ways to go for your 1,000,000 comment karma... just a little ways.  That's ok having over 1,000,000 link karma without being hated here by many like Gallow... is pretty cool!##**CONFETTI**

Yes - in this sub these statistics are seperated for each 1000 numbers counted - so you are only listed once in this particular table!

Edit: Sorry I was wrong both your counts were in this 1000 - one of your counts didn't "count" because it was posted to late (happens to the best of us, some of these counters are really fast!)

So you are officially at 3 counts in this sub now... on the [list](https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=10000)

You are probably on a whole lot of lists LOL
 This is so funny - typo-city btw - you are crazy so is rs!!!

This has been one of the fun and funniest days ever in this sub!!Well I thought /u/superduckman 's guildings were pretty funny:


https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3rtrs3/547k_counting_thread/cwre5v7?context=3



and I thought *everyone* summing /u/rschaosid and my meltdown because he wasn't here was pretty funny:

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3rx49u/550k_counting_thread/cwsb6xs?context=3

Don't know to many funny and eventful things to list in the past 24 hours!!

I'm gonna have to buy stock in confetti!!**EVENTFUL DAY**

For those who missed it - I'll post a few links to a few of the events of the day.

Also congrats to Evo - for making the TOP 50 counters!

##**UPDATE**

To witness one of the biggest snipes in /r/counting history - preventing atom from regaining his throne - check this out 

[Maniac - lives up to his claim to fame as #1 sniper here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3rz7ki/552k_counting_thread/cwsnqxa)

it's all good - atom took it like a champ amazing sportsmanship like conduct!! and blue really deserves to bask in the glory of top spot for more then just a few hours after how hard he worked for it I think - so it all worked out!

Now back to your regularly scheduled counting!!

**HUG**

Whitney

awww  atom!! You are still by far the top counter here by a few... ie: over **30,000** counts!!! 

I think blue's accomplishment is awesome - of course!

But you still stand out here in *soooooooooo* many ways!  I could list at least 10 ways you stand out amongst 7,800+ counters -  without having to even think about it!

##**CONGRATS**

but bad-bad-bad time for a snipe!!!!


It's all good - you have a right to fight to live up to your claim to fame here as #1 sniper.. and boy-oh-boy did you just secure that spot! LOL


##**HUG**

guess Maniac wants to live up to his fame here - just like you do... glad you aren't screaming bloody murder right now...
Well - from where I am sitting - that was the harshest snipe ever here - glad you are taking it so well!!!

I mean you can relate at least - as far as enjoying being on top and he certainly just secured his spot as TOP sniper! 

I had a whole special congrats thing all cut and pasted and ready to go!!

Save it for later!


Glad you are not stressing about this - as far as time wasted - I don't think so, didn't you have fun and wasn't that intense? Not really wasted!!

**HUG**

 Awwww!

You are too!!553,014

I've never gotten them all in with one counter before - this will be a first. (ie never done 10 counts in a row before)|

Someone else is here though - judging from your upvotes when I'd forgotten to do them (ironic that I forget to upvote after my 52432432412 upvotes here LOL)

553,026553,028

It's funny - the way this count is working right now - I just have to look at *your* number to know my count (ie currently 7)553,030

Ya EVO loves coincidences!!

Happy counting zotc!  

and your post was so *original*

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/search?q=two+kinds+of+people&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

Only gives a hundred + results.

But of course you are the only one who's ever thought of this phrase!

Examples going all the way 3 years back... amazing that you think you are the one who invented this phrase LOL.

"Reddit, what's the best way to finish the statement: There are two kinds of people in the world.."

"Reddit, what's the Truest version of "There are two kinds of people in this world...""

"There are two kinds of people in this world... (what are they?)"



ack - the snipes the past few days have been tough ones - going light on the confetti!!

5 and 6 

some (I think most) copy the first 5 digits and paste those 555,43  (then they add the last digit)

some copy all 6 digits and delete the ones that need to be changed.  I don't understand this method and how it's faster but apparently for a couple here (rs) it is

- it's pretty rough to try and get #'s in while they are doing a 'run' (between them they've counted over 80,000 times so they are damn fast)

They'll be done soon - you can either keep trying or wait for them to finish in about 15 minutes.  At least you got one number in ... ruining rs getting a perfect 500 counts! Well people try often - it's part of the 'game' here - chances of you succeeding though (against atom)... only if it's a total fluke! Could happen though!

You ask how they are so fast - take a look at this list and note the top two name and their total # of counts - can't believe you managed to get a number in that was in time!

I believe this is the first time I've ever seen you move up a level here LOL! 
(Hard to move up from #1!)

At least you may have a new appreciation for this particular #1 - since it's no longer just a given! /u/rschaosid - if you aren't gone already can you put up the participation chart so our /u/CoStCo19  can see his moment of fame - sniping a # from *you*? 

**HUG**

rs saw my message - so the chart should be up soon I think!

Congrats again for managing to get a # in with the two top counters doing a run together - no small feet!ahhhh looks like you didn't spoil rs's perfect 500 /u/Costsco19 - the speed they were counting I'd assumed they were trying for a perfect 500 each. Which is why they weren't letting you get a # in edgewise.  

Still pretty cool you managed to get a # in there!
Yup figured that out by the chart :)  I was not here for the whole k - I thought you were trying for a perfect 500.  I think perfect 500's are pretty cool but hopefully you and others will consider not trying for those (and speed records) on back to back k's for the sake of everyone else here.

Looks like /u/Xeam is gonna need to make a 2nd set of family pics!

aaaaaaaaaand I'm counting!

Howdy Farty or should I say  "side thread sniper" - will you ever live it down!!

Wow - anyone realize there have been more than **30** gold handed out in this sub in the past 30 days?  Used to be just a karma machine - now it's a gilding machine as well - thanks in large part to /u/rschaosid 's generosity! I've enjoyed handing my fair share as well - I like to do 'funny' ones! (I also like to gild people who have depression issues elsewhere on Reddit)

Oh - and there have been several who added their TIDBITs to the TIDBIT thread this week - check them out if you get a chance! (and add yours if you'd like to and haven't yet)

Edit: ::::TWIDDLING THUMBS::::: someeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeebody count with me!!!!557,281

Howdy user - doing great - you?

 Yup rs has gilded me at least ~~three~~ four times!

~~557,288~~

You guys are counting too fast for me to keep up - I'll do the rest of my counts later!

user:

I don't understand most of the non-main threads - I'm gifted in some things - but very very very bad at math (probably 3rd grade level math understanding here)

Also - I want to move up the chart a bit - soooooo using them here to help me do that.

I love that new battle-thread though - too funny to watch rs and others go nuts there!!

Love the sheep thread too - so once I am at a point where I can't really move up the chart (after TOP 300) - I'll probably use some on the sheep thread.

rs:

Howdy rs - were your ears burning?I think stats for a few of the other threads would be great - discussion should be had as to which ones would best fit having stats.

##**UNCLE!!** 

Stttttttooooooooooooopppp gilding me /u/rschaosid!!!! I have enough gold for a lifetime now! (thanks *again* of course) 
Someone took you quite literally!Yup! Love it!! (I have credited you for it a few times - if you haven't seen them)

Don't know how many will see this - but it'd be fun for all those recently gilded to drop in to /r/lounge for the New Member monday mixer:

https://www.reddit.com/r/lounge/comments/3s4cs0/the_lounges_monday_new_member_mixer/557,374

I know - cracking up here - I was so busy trying to disguise my unique writting style that I forgot to hit anon button LOL557,383

I say my anon gild attempt was an *epic fail* :)557,**444**

My first trips!! Not much but hey at least it's *something*

Dang - almost got my first **420** in!

Yup - looks like I'll hit the TOP 500 today (or tommorow?) I'll be happy with that!!  

My goal is TOP 300 though.

Edit: You know I've been working on getting these 10 counts in for an hour now!!!557,462

Gonna have to change my flair now that I've gotten my first significant #!!557,464

thanks - to the *exclusive* trips club here I come!! hehe

557,467

aaaaaaaaaaaand I'm done! 

Whew - this 10 counts took forever!!

Now I wait - to see if I made the TOP 500!


for all those who have gold  drop in /r/lounge New member mixer sometime if you get a chance:

[New members](https://www.reddit.com/r/lounge/comments/3s4cs0/the_lounges_monday_new_member_mixer/)He's only got one count in the stats so it looks like his counts were normally too late anyways - in cases like that it's kinda good to delete them isn't it?Howdy! 420 is *very* popular around these parts!

You should see the [420 thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3c4hin/420k_counting_thread_420_count_it/)!

You might as well gear up for an attempted snipe though... can't hurt to try.

Thought for sure atom was gonna nab this one!Well I made a confetti replicator out of the bit of confetti Pixel gave me the other day... so I am stockpiling it.

I'll call someone from /r/pitchforkemporium /u/PitchforkEmporium  can you help us out?

We need some heavy duty pitchforks here!

Edit: I don't know exactly how it works to summon someone with pitchforks - see them out in the wilds all the time.  Maybe they don't drop into the smaller subs. Perhaps we just have to wait... atom - simple yet elegant

"just letting you know I was here.... and didn't even \*try to snipe the k"&gt; we've just signed a year long lease together.

*that* explains it.

for a glimps into what your future holds see /r/deadbedrooms

rs... do you have some sort of **problem** with dots??? if so... wanna take this /r/outside???Well I don't recommend you try counting the dot's in my profile... could take a few years LOL.tbh - the #'s all jumbled into one - is really unpleasant to read but I live with it sigh.Is that the number of dot's in my profile? More than even I suspected...I never realized just how much I use them until some dude questioned me about it a few months ago :) ##**,**OMG! I think this is the first time I've been downvoted in this sub... even Bucky didn't downvote *me*!

rs - thwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwappppppp!!You guys realize if james shows up we are gonna be in big trouble...

edit: no idea how this comment ended up here... hmmm.
he's not a fan of us flooding the screen with chit-chat instead of counting :)My BF - stopped by a few minutes ago for a drive-by-kiss

pretty sweet eh? :)pssssssssssssst speaking of james....Nope wasn't me - if you check the thread - I was busy trying to calm Xeam down elsewhere... that comment puzzled me when I saw it later.

I *was* going to say WinRar but then I realized WinRar has probably already been said.  So I won't say WinRar because I don't want to be redundant.  

I'll have to think of something else besides WinRar... brbMistake???

You guys were counting so fast - I couldn't even upvote as fast as you were counting LOL.

Howdy! 

Thank you for stopping in!

One of regulars has been bad. Very.Bad.

I think this moment has passed, but I'm sure he's not done with his antics...

So if you could pick out a pitchfork that would be fitting for a group of counters (yes... counters...) it would be much appreciated!

**HUG**

WhitneySoooooooooooooo in all the hype of atom retaking the throne... you slip into #2 assists unnoticed eh?

KingCaspian happened to mention it tonight - had to retrace everything to find out when you made this big move!

So here's a bit of fanfair - a bit late - but better then never!!

think I've done a broad enough time frame to keep them from bunching up... I can't say for sure but I think with the broad brush I've painted as to when to post, there won't be too many occasions where two or more are done at the same time... 

I don't know - this is my first prank ever - and first experience in my life of trying to do something with people in all kinds of different timezones, into a time zone that isn't even mine LOL. I've learned more about time zones in the past 48 hours then the entire rest of my life combined!

I think it'll be fine if once in a while there are two or three at about the same time... 

He's going to figure it out... the goal is just for him to not be "100% sure" it's a prank until most that have wanted to be a part of this have been able to do at least one of their requests (hopefully their second one later)

As far as the ones done after 11-12 EST - it's basically just a matter of minutes before any doubt he had that something is up - is gone - soooooooooooooo :)


There are several people who do some of the stat stuff in the sub - but rs is the one who does the most 'on the fly' stats - when someone requests some stat in the sub. 

See the Hall of Gold on the sidebar - several of his latest ones have gotten gilded.

:)BTW /r/counting has gone eerily silent since I sent all these reminders... 5 posts in an hour - during what's usually a busy part of the day 5-8 pm in the USA :)

Odd! Wonder if people are busy trying to figure out their request options - or catching up on this sub... or if it's just a huge coincidence LOLUh oh - rs better watch out - looks like we have a budding stat-man in our midst!!607,276

aaaaaaaaaaand I add a count!!

#**Inb4 stat requests are queued into 2019:**

/u/rschaosid can I get a stat where 

counts &gt; 274 

counts &lt; 2932 *and* 

no more than 3 gets

how many times have they been sniped?


I know you are busy so take your time getting back to me!

p.s. miss you all - looking forward to my full time return as part time cheerleader early next year!

Looks like we created ~~a monster!!~~ monsters!!!

/u/rschaosid forgive them, they know not what they do. Oh and while you are reading this can I get a stat on...

atom - part of the game plan is for him to know in the end which were legit stat requests and which were the non legit - ie those  after 2:00 pm EST - so I think it's all good in the end LOL :)

**HUG**


#**610,358**

Thank you!!

Ain't that cute... don't know how much he had to be creative to come up with that chart... 

But yup no matter how silly that chart is - it is cool to be on one with you big guys LOL - tied with bluesolid and nitrome - even if it is a bit stretching the obscure - that's still not to shabby hehehe :)

It's not like I'd ever be able to be on one of the TOP charts without having to create some obscure random reason for it :)

But ya he posted "my" leader board - shortly after yours so that was fun :)


I still can NOT believe you got THAT many 1 second replies ! Pretty damn impressive - I would love to see a run of a k between you and rs - you'd probably blow the record out of the water!I see that - I was frozen in time 1 count away from 400 before I left.. :) 

I will be in the TOP 300 at some point after I come back full time (as part time cheerleader) That will be cool.  I don't really have any desire to reach the TOP 200 though - I'm gonna be happy with TOP 300 :)

But you on the other hand - you've been frozen in time just a few hours away from the really exclusive and impressive 20,000 k club! Been waiting an waiting  and waiting.... for you to get there LOL.

a bit slow perhaps but hey *somebody* had to attempt to snipe you!I was still faster than that one guy who won with a 10 minute k!! :)

Had a ton of fun watching you two and your 1s replies!

Nite you crazy crazy speed demons!!!

**HUG**

I'm gonna have to check my profile... I have a feeling he may be stealing some of my 2,900+ ellipses he counted in my profile once... :)##**Congrats!!**

Your first k in over 60? k's from what I can tell... you had this one coming I think!

Tried to snipe it but I was a tad late ... LOL :)613,024

We are actually getting close to the drome but I got bumped to odds

No biggy though... not really that concerned about a drome 613,247613,249613,253

So it looks like I am finally done with EMBED and trying to report you - now I just keep trying to give you gold LOL613,255613,257

Oh I'm glad I'm on odds - will get another **69** LOL613,263613,267

Three in one night! This must be my lucky # :)613,271613,273

I think perhaps I'll be the **69** sniper here when I come back.. pop in like Pixel does for the drome's :)613,275

Yup!613,277

Looks like I'm finally done trying to give you gold - got that like 5 numbers in a row :)613,279613,281613,283

How about we wrap this up one before the drome - on the off chance pixel will be the first to find it there?613,285613,295613,297

ug... now I'm back to trying to report you LOL613,299613,301

I've never viewed a drome from 'this' angle before :)613,315


aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand it's a wrap!!

Awesome you were the one who helped me get the TIDBITS thread started and helped me with my first "run" here. :)

I'm gonna go back and see if I beat my 7 seconds at all.

It's been an eventful run... moved to the TOP 300, doubled my total # of counts here, tried to report you about 10 times, tried to give you gold about 8, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand got 3 **69**'s!! :)

Thanks a lot hun!!

**HUG**




EDIT: Ironic that this run has left me 10 short of TOP 200 (which I didn't even aspire too!)613,317




I just did a RUN! LOLThank You :) 

Nitrome used a years worth of patience up in one night I'm thinking though LOL.

Anyhow back to the PM world &amp; my computer problems - for lil ole' Whitney - this has been a blast!615,372

Howdy everyone!

Thanks /u/rschaosid  for the HoC update!!!

mfw - I need just **4** counts to hit TOP 200!!

I'm jealous you to get to meet "IRL" - I've met over 100 of my online friends live over the years and it's always fun. Esp. when you are close like you two are! :)

Now to see if I can get these 4 counts in LOL.615,391

Howdy Moo - I'm about to hit the **Big leagues** TOP 200!! :)

EDIT: I deleted that post because Pixel's was first (on my screen anyhow) Now I'm not sure if it counts or not.  So I'll just do 6 to be sure LOL.615,393

Thank you pixel... I should have waited a bit before deleting it - I will if that happens again. 

**HUG**

1 more count and I am one of  you guys!! :)615,396

##**Woohoo!!**

Wondering if I should use some of pixel's confetti on myself hehehe.

##**\u2600\u2665\u2600TOP 200!!\u2600\u2665\u2600**

Now since rs just updated the HoC an hour or so ago  - I'm gonna have to learn some major patience! (maybe I can dl photoshop and photoshop me in at 199! LOL.

Everyone take care!

From your fellow - TOP 200'er!!

**HUG**

Whitney

EDIT: Yup /u/anothershittyalt but when it's updated I'll be 199 :) (or at least if I think so)rs +10  XP.I'm thinkin' 89 mods is just not enough, besides it's an ODD number and nobody and I mean *nobody* likes ODD numbers...

so... I could put us back on EVENs if only you were to MOD me :)

Thank you! 

This place really needed 1 more mod! 

I'll try and do my share of the heavy-duty-moddy-type-stuff!

:)I am thinkin' I need a flair! 

Who do I sell my soul to - to get a flair?uh oh...

this could be serious!

yes I want you to hit-me-with-a-flair!! :)

Oh boy... I'm going to have to recruit some help on this one... I'm pretty much clueless on how to do that BUT I have some pretty savvy friends!

In the meantime perhaps you can peek at my profile to help you think of a fitting flair for me - it's a bit of an odd profile I think!

I'm off now to work on this quest! It's ok - I got my 'crew' helping me now :)

I'll pick the one I think is funniest and post it here :)

Ok - I've looked at those I was linked to and I like this one the best... hopefully you will too!

EDIT: sorry I'm not sure how to post it here I guess.  If you google the following you should be able to find it.  (If not I'll try a different one but this one is soooo cute!!)

Google: Top 5 Funny kid Videos! 

it'll be the first link :)The above link is working now (I think?)

Twiddlin' thumbs.Today is the **6 month anniversary** of the day/night I brought **642++ users here** to the yard!!

Was just going through my history and tags for all those people, and I'm kinda proud of myself for over 400 of those on the Hall of Counters 10,000 list counted here as a direct result of my posts in an AskReddit question.  I think that's pretty cool.  

[The original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/38lohe/what_hobby_instantly_makes_any_stranger_1000x/crw1caj)

river aka /u/rideride notes the influx of visitors - 

rideride

390,171 

Thanks. And damn, 210 people online on this sub. It's usually like 9 lol.


sooooooooooooo  I learned how to make a screenshot and grabbed this one:

http://imgur.com/gDlFUVB

I was sooooooooo exited to show him that - I think I showed it to all those I had met here via the WHY?!?! thread a month or so earlier LOL.


Several have done  counting here. So while I might not have contributed much to the count myself, maybe I have vicariously through them.  I think the most famous (or would that be infamous?) would be Bucky_Barnes1 - it's nice to see him back (as counter45).  He got the 390,000 GET his first day here and was hooked! 

Bucky...

Anyhow just can't believe it's only been 6 months, that feels like a year+ ago!

I &lt;3 all ya'all!!

**HUG**

nobreadsticks recognizes me from my orignal posts here in the WHY?!?!?! thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/38c21i/388k_counting_thread/crwawjh?context=10000

EDIT:  I think the funniest comment in that AskReddit post replies in that AskReddit thread was this one:


fredemu 

The craziest part of that subreddit is that there's this whole culture built around it. There are leader boards for people that have managed to get the ...999 numbers (which end threads). There are some people have 20+ of these. They practice different methods of counting (like counting by primes, or backwards, or with letters instead of numbers, and so on).
Basically, there are people that view this thing regularly and enjoy posting numbers. **There are local celebrities (like the guy who has 60 999s)**

Wonder who that local celebrity might have been - who here had 60 999's 6 months ago I wonder? :)##**\u272b\u2665,\u2605\u2665\u25d5\u273f CONGRATS!! river!!\u272b\u2665,\u2605\u2665\u25d5\u273f**

Can't believe you GOT that! 
A free count in the main thread!!

It's been over 7 months - you are due for a count!

Thanks!

I have a slightly odd profile I think but hopefully you'll think of something fitting :)

Slightly Odd will do! It's fitting!!

Your first k!!!!618,103

Welcome - 14 karma in 1 1/2 years? 

You're burnin' down the house with all that sweet karma!!

Welcome back purple you'll note your name is still shining on the sidebar over there ----&gt;^^^61

whew!
LOL!!! I missed this comment in the WALL of comments on my screen about this - this made me smile - was feeling a bit down &amp; very confused... but now I can't stop smiling - lets keep these two side comments... just for the humor!! :)

EDIT: if anyone happens to see this from the Hall of Gold - I made an error - insanity ensued. I had **5** "continue this threads" on my screen ack!

So I deleted all my ever more confused  replies... then I found shiz priceless comment here - so keeping this because it's amazing how 8 little words can change an entire atmosphere in seconds!#CONGRATS!! 

on your first k - if you get a chance add it to your flair 

and note your name posted over there ---&gt; 



Saw your struggle count after count to get one in - you managed to get one of the best ones in LOL

So this is fascinating - you came in once over a year ago and counted ONE time... then come back a over a year later - curious what made you remember this sub?

Here's your first count long before most of us had ever heard of this sub :)


[288,451](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/2hrvg4/288k_counting_thread/ckxze8g)619,179

Sorry RoomPooper  it's #**OVER** between us!!!!

No upvote - no wedding day!!619,183

#OTHER FAMILY???

You've NEVER told me about another family have you!!!619,185

I hope my brothers don't find out about this they are #**VERY** overprotective of me!!619,187

How long were you planning to KEEP all this from me????619,200

Sorry but I'm too devastated to keep counting... you should have told me SOONER!!

GOODBYE!!! 


I'm just going to sit back and enjoy my 9 ks!! 

Perhaps I'll go for a 10th!


I looked up the definition of **selflessness** in the dictionary and here's what I found:

adjective:  acting with less concern for yourself than for the success of the joint activity

adjective: Fascinating recent first k stats from some of our very happy counters:

EDIT: One tragedy in all of this is poor /u/idunnowhy9000 he'd went 149 k's participated in without a get...that streak is over now at the rate he was going he may have been nipping at Moon's heals by spring.

Next thing you know username and dude are gonna fall off the leader board of the most k's participated in without a get.  Looks like Moonflower's reign will be secure at #1 forever :)I really appreciate you trying to take some of the load off of rs hun... 

this stat idea of his was brilliant and has always been one of my favorites :)

Hopefully you can work out the kinks and rs won't have us pestering him anymore for this awesome stat he was giving us! 

Thank you for the time you've put into figuring this out for us :)

Good luck with working out the the pesky issues!

~~My 5th **69**!~~

Welcome back /u/torncolours - congrats on the gold!!I failed 2nd grade math! 

TY for the flair edit info tip - got it back to proudly display my 9ks!!!That's awesome - 100,000 counting karma!

That means you have an AVERAGE of 4 upvotes per count! 

Considering how many of those 25,000's were runs with just 1 other person counting (1ish upvote and normally 1 from me till past 4-5 weeks) that's a whole lot of upvotes on your non-runs!!

EDIT: patting self on the back for being responible for perhaps ~10% of those upvotesrs + 10 XP&gt; 380k was 4-5 months 

370 k was 6 months ago... :) 

I just posted my 250k anniversary 

that was *the* thread soooo I have insider info on that thread LOL.

(prior to that I was just a lurker/mystery upvoter)Don't know how many will see this but if you bookmark the TIDBITs index you can see at a glance for anyone who's posted their TIDBITs - what # they started at (as well as being just one click away from their TIDBITs)


#[TIDBIT INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cwk5d40)

Just noticed my new flair! 

First flair I've ever had outside my main sub!

It's fitting! 

Thanks!I'm just behind you at 2,947 /r/counting karma and I don't really even count here LOL.

Guess all of my congrats over the past 6 months have paid off :)#*.*!!

&gt; I guess now it's time to go for 200K Counting Karma :P

I'll be helping you get there. 

Out of curiosity I just did a sort by TOP on your profile... pre that 10,000k in 48 hours of late - there are only a handful or two of your counts here that I didn't upvote in the past 7+ months :)

1001 0100 0000 0000

is this right?

#WooHoo!

My first "real" GET in this sub!

Thank you!

Now I have to figure out how to do a thread here - be patient it may take me a bit to get it right.

(can someone please PM me what the next GET here is so I can post it in the thread title as they did for this one?)Ok hang tight this is a first for me making a counting thread here - I have to figure out how it's done and so on. I'll get it up soon! 

This will be sooooooo cool seeing MY name and flair on the "new comments" page every time I view it for a while. Hehehe :)

Can you check that out and make sure I did everything right please?

TYWell I would love to but I have no idea what that # would be - gonna try for a few minutes to figure out this on my own - if you don't see it up in 5 minutes... please whisper the # for me LOL.1001 0100 0000 0000

I figured it out myself! :)

Don't feel too bad for counter45 - he really can live without getting 50% of all k's here recently. LOL 

2 GETS and 2 GOLD in 2 DAYS ... doesn't seem like he's really suffering too bad.

Great to see you back - if you look at the # of newbies getting k's lately - you'll see the big guns &amp;  snipers are going out of their way lately to NOT snipe peoples first ks.  

So times have changed since you were last here!

**HUG**

|um???

WHAT???

Don't snipe the k's from now on manaic - just do like EVO used to do and out muscle everyone with your 100X faster internet and thousands more practice counts than the rest of us.

EVO I know you are relatively new here but the big guys - ESPECIALLY Maniac_34 have gone OUT of their way lately to NOT snipe peoples first k's here. So many have gotten the thrill of their first k's because of the selflessness of all these guys - so don't bash on them! 

 Check the Hall of Fame or the last time any of them have gotten a k!!!! 


**HUG**

Yes I know you've been gone alot lately - but it's been quite some time since ANYONE's first k has been sniped or anyone has muscled in in the 900's on evens.

They are being very very selfless - so I wanted to defend them.

Thanks for being such a sport

There's more to life here than getting 50% of all k's recently - it's sweet for you to defend Bucky aka Counter45 but I think Maniac has a right to live up to his claim to fame here as world class sniper instead of just giving Bucky 50% of all k's of late :)


You remember when you were the 1 exception in over 50 ks to get a first k here? 
that WASN'T a **2** second reply time?

Check this stat!!! Clearly times have changed.. one of these guys got the GET with a **12** second reply with 3 of the big guns there AT the time. A FUCKING MAZING

Pretty much after me leaving cause I couldn't even get 1 single count in - in over 10,000 counts... (amongst other reasons) things have changed around here and it's all because of those at the top putting all the rest of us before themselves and what's best for them here for a while now!

Check these GET reply times - wow!

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3ve78a/free_talk_friday_14/cxpyd4m

EDIT: I'm just saying Maniac_34 has a right to at least partake in his claim to fame when he's been so selfless here for quite some time.  
It's ok I'm glad you brought this to light - these guys have done all this selflessness - without even taking any credit for it... so it feels good to let everyone know just how amazing and awesome these guys have been lately.... for the sake of the other 80% of us.

Not only can we all count here again - people left and right have been able to have the excitement of their first get, been able to start their very own thread in the MAIN THREAD,  add a GET to their flairs.. be able to see their name shining on the sidebar and be able to have their names in the Hall of Fame and on and on.  

They've all done so much for us - if they wanna snipe each other and others with a few k's when they happen to be up there in the evens towards a get... then I say GAME ON - they should at least be able to still get some of their needs met to here, until we run out of those without their first k's - we are getting there!!

Yes I realize you've been pretty much gone since this really started... you've been out of "the loop" cause you haven't even tried for a k in a long time so no reason to bring you "in on it" 

:)

Moo + 10 XPWell this is my XP system - my call LOL. 
rs - these are AWESOME - thank you!

would it be at all possible for you to do this for the 388 &amp; 389 threads if I provide you links?

Those two are my first and one of my main claims to fame here 

**642** users here now!!

We'll be see just how many new counters I brought to the yard. I'll bet they both have around 200ish new counters in them.

Here is a link to the 388 thread when they all started joining...

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/38c21i/388k_counting_thread/

EDIT: Just been scrolling through the "new comments" page - holy hell - I'm gonna have to start a WHOLE NEW save category just for all these! Sooooooooooo friggen cool to see so many old names and first times for so many of these counters!!!!

"That's not how it works, that's not how *any* of this works" 

(where'd I get THAT from)

Nope. XP only works here for 1st time for each level of achievement."That's not how it works, that's not how *any* of this works" 

(where'd I get THAT from)

Nope. Greedy Greedy Greedy!!Awesome!! Thank you!

Do you have an instant, easy way to tell me how many of those are new? (if not I'll be happy to 

count them one by one)

Looking for the 389 thread now...

EDIT: Thank you - I have a hard time adding up # of new counters for some reason (eyesite I think)

66 new counters in one k not to shabby - luckily there were plenty of regulars around to help them learn the ropes.  I think the next thread had quite a few more first time counters, but I never went through all 111 "continue this thread"s on that k.

It's sort of fun to see my first claim to fame here being posted out like this!!! I mean few even know about this "642 counters here" thing (except perhaps those who've seen the www.sidethreaddocs.com website that I made.)
 &gt; You brought so many people to the 389k thread that the chart for 389k is over 10,000 characters--too big to fit in a comment........

&gt; I hope you're happy LOL

#YES, I'm HAPPY!!

I've always loved my first claim to fame here - but this is the first time I've seen any of it displayed other than my "continue this thread" for 111 times to see all the new counters.

I'm betting that thread is the only one you've tried to count the contributors to that wouldn't fit in a comment.  I know there's at least one other though when this sub was featured on the BBB as one of the 5 strangest communities on the Internet!!!

Hey bucky! 

I know you are busy counting - but your first count here EVER was just posted in a participation chart 

(it's now in the Hall of Gold on the sidebar if you want to get a cute blast from the past)
I just posted the story about this in the FTF thread (it was the 6th month anniversary of this event)

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3ve78a/free_talk_friday_14/cxoxerdThis is interesting - I'm gonna have to investigate and find out what was going on between 410, 411 and 412... and why the huge influx of users - these weren't because of a mention in /bestof... or a major milestone.

I'll post the answer here when I figure it out.

I'm soooo loving all these charts.

I made a new category "RS CHARTS" and have saved them all so if anyone ever needs to peek at one again they can ask me.

I'll likely post a link to each of these somewhere on the Sheep Saga sight so it's handy for all (or maybe in the TIDBITS thread since so many have that bookmarked)

Whit4You is my original account (been using it for years on the interent) 

I switched to this alt (incog-ish) one to be slightly less stalk-able when I had a RL stalker online.another one to investigate - something going on here...

(I'm glad you started adding # of new counters - makes things so much easier to learn the history of this sub's count...) 

p.s. thank you rs!! you are exceptional! 

Note:

This one stands out with so many counters because it was bestof'd and a major milestone 400k.

p.s. thank you rs - you are extraordinary!Note:

First one I've seen that didn't involve a significant run that had not ONE single new counter.

p.s. thank you rs - you are unparalleled!
Note:

/u/throwthrowawaytime was just 8 counts away from a perfect 500.

I'll investigate this and see if he was trying for a 500 (started from first count) and someone stepped in (I'll put em on our *list* if thats the case) 

Or if he just happened to do alot of counting in the thread.

p.s. thank you /u/rschaosid when we write the book on the history of this sub - we'll have to credit you on every page.  I could write a book on how much can be gleaned from these charts!!!

p.s. thank you rs - you are outstanding

(I wonder which is gonna happen first - rs running out of k's to give the stats on - or me running out of adjectives to use in my thanks!! time to break out the thesaurus!
Note:

442 - 443 - 444 - 445

Relfect what happens with back-to-back (to back-to-back) runs.  Just **one** new counter was able to get a count in in over 4,000 counts. 

an interesting history of the sub tidbit

the next time this happened I threw my first "fit" ever online coining the term that spawned a subreddit /r/onlyproscounting

[back-to-back-to-back runs happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3oy2pp/509k_counting_thread/cw1j50n)

EDIT: for anyone not "in the know" back-to-back-to-back runs are now a very rare exception.

p.s. thank you rs - you are remarkable!Note:

/u/smarvin6689 makes his debut count here with 171 counts!!!

currently in the TOP 80 of all time.

p.s. thank you rs - you are phenomenal!Between this k and the one you can't display cause it broke your stat thingy hehe...

[389k Contribution chart by rs\u2122] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rschaosid/wiki/counting_participation_chart_389k)

Just off hand I've noticed I brought 

#\#35 counter /u/counting45 (aka Bucky_Barnes1)

and the 

#\#43 counter /u/AlexandrGrothendieck

to the yard. (I've always known about them of course - just never saw it on display like this... one of those who joined that day also got the 400,000 milestone!! /u/ikodn - I was giving him the tips and tricks behind the scenes to try and go for the biggest get here in a long time and he got it!!!)

perhaps I might add 5000+ vicarious counts to my 270 counts here or not LOL:) 

 

Note:

Another thread to investigate - clearly something happened here - 38 new counters in this thread and 58 in the previous one 437k.

Wonder what event caused this spike in the /r/counting matrix.

p.s. thank you rs - you are A-NUMBER-1!

Note:

Whatever event - happening for threads 435-436 and 437k appears to have brought

number 36 counter /u/throwthrowawaytime

to the yard.

throwaway - do you remember what brought you here? would save me some time having to investigate if it was the reason you joined.

p.s. thank you rs - you are absolutely exceptional!thanks - this doesn't help my investigation there are over 100 new counters during this 3 k time frame so obviously something happened - not a milestone, not a /bestof.... I'll add this to my to do list.

But thanks for that info - it's great to know what brought some of our top counters of all time here to the yard! 

Also interesting to note when someone came for the karma but stayed long after they had plenty of it - ie got hooked :) 

**HUG**

Ok so whatever this event was that I'll be finding out about... didn't bring you to the yard - you just happened to switch your Reddit username that day!

you were already a somewhat regular with 500 counts under your belt before this.
Well 100+ new actual counters means a hell of a lot here for a 24+ hour period... so something had to happen to cause this. If it was word of the karma potential here - it had to be mentioned in at the TOP of a Front Page post like mine was. Or some other event (like the BBC and Mashable arcticles for  example) 

This is the third major influx that I'll have to investigate and find out who/what brought them all here.

Check to see if you hit yo milestones here today!

oh and if you want to be totally amazed - check out the https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/

for the past few hours - somebody's been a very very busy boy!!!

EDIT: I just love how whenever people find out about the Hall of Counters being updated the sub goes dead silent for a while everyone checks their status and those they are curious about's status's LOL. Moo + 10 XPThank you hun!! 

The side thread fanatics have been dying for side thread stats for a while now... it's nice to see you taking some of the load off of rs here!!


this is one of the first side threads contribution charts I've seen where

/u/a-username-for-me

isn't at the top of! :)

Note:

and here we find 

# /u/skizfrenik_syco

making his debut

he just hit the TOP 50 of all time today!!

p.s. thank you rs!! you are unrivaled 

there are 76 of these presented to use today - I'm definiately gonna have to break out the thesaurus I'm already running out of adjectives with like 25 of them!!!
Thank you hun!!

At this rate we might have to give you a cut of rs's salary!!!!Thanks again hun!

How hard would it be for you to add the *denotes new counter to these charts?

It's really awesome to see when someone first joined in on these threads.

I will see to it that your salary is doubled if you add this feature!!!622 174

I make note of Hall of Counters by rs\u2122 update - 1 count in 30+ minutes...

I hope you'll at least drop in for the **999,000** thread.  

That is going to be a day to be here!

p.s. Thanks AGAIN rs!! You are unbelievable! I'm working on a plan to DOUBLE your salary!!Note:

Here we have 

# /u/SuperDuckMan 's 

first dipping his toes in the side threads...

He made it to the TOP 100 counters before taking a haitus for school and such.

If you'd like a good laugh - check this out... a mini-gold train on this sweet newbie:

["I love this sub"](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3rtrs3/547k_counting_thread/cwrdz2w)

---

also of note is 

/u/skizfrenik_syco dipping his toes in yet another side thread... are there any side threads left that he hasn't joined? 

I think he should be dubbed Side Thread Captain\u2122

Thank you hun - these side thread lovers must really be happy now!

boy when 

/u/TheNitromeFan decides to join a side thread he goes all out! #3 counter his first time! 

I noticed both /u/silverlava and /u/Syrrim both made their Alphanumerics (base 36) debute at this time as well. 

pssssst don't let rs know we are giving you a cut of his lucrative stat man salary! 

p.s. before you get to far into this how hard would it be to denote who got the GET for each one of these? Like bolding the GET winners name? or using another thingy-ma-jigger like the astericks? 

(if it's too hard don't worry about it for now - I imagine these side thread peeps would much rather see as many of these charts as they can rather than you humoring people like me who want even more details for each - you can get to this added info at a later date)Note:

The first significant statistical major anomaly in a side thread  **16** new participants to this Participation Chart. Far and away more than any other one of these charts to date.

I'd love to investigate this as I will the glitches to the Main Thread matrix... but I don't know enough to figure it out.

My first guess was this was during the insane back-to-back-to-back runs that culminated with a more-or-less a **10,000** count run.  Causing most to flock in droves to the side threads for a while... but this one was long before that.

And the few other ideas I had led nowhere as well.

So if anyone is interested in figuring out why this major anomaly occured - I'd be interested in knowing the answer.

/u/dudebroshitpants

/u/a-username-for-me

any idea? was this just suddenly THE side thread to count in? or perhaps the first time ya'all started using those 3 username mentions to entice people to the side threads or? 

all the other contribution charts he's listed for the side threads have 0 to ~4 new counters... this one has 16... sooooo something's up with this puppy! :)


---

p.s. We've been talking to the head of /r/counting's a-counting and we've decided to double your cut of rs's lucrative salary!! 20%!!! Whew! 
#OH

#NO

#YOU

#DIDN'T!


::::: taking a break from these stat chart studies to make the soon to be needed RIP Graphic for you! ::::::Thanks for your feedback...

yes it is an anomaly - a major one. 

when there is a really sharp spike in the data there's some reason behind it that can be traced back to some event/situation/change etc. 

There are several in the Main Thread that I've found so far, one of those sharp spike anomalies was courtesy of Whit4You... the others I'm going to find out what caused them.

This is the only one I've found in the side threads... so if none of you can figure out what triggered this. Or aren't interested in why.. perhaps one day when I'm done with the incredible amount of information and data to be gleened from the 76+ charts our stat-hero just posted for the Main Thread... 

I'll see if I can figure out this glitch-in-the-side-thread matrix as well.  The only thing I know for sure is it wasn't when I brought the **652**++ users to the yard, this was a few months later, not a /bestof or major milestone influx... 7 of those new counters appear to be new to the sub as well... but there was absolutely NO influx of newbies to the Main thread at that time 

(something you can tell easily by noting # of comments to a given Main Thread none of the main threads at this time had an influx of newbies -ie they are ~1020 comments total. )

If I keep thinking about this perhaps I can solve it even with knowing next to nothing about the side threads outside the sheep and throwaway's.

If I figure this for ya'all do I get a raise?? The cost of all these special unique CONGRATS of late are sky-rocketing!!

^^^10Note:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand here's our /bestof mention for the **500,000** major milestone.

who brought countless visitors to the yard

two of note 

/u/DrYoshiyahu - loved, loved, loved Yoshi! 

I'd love to see him come back, he was awesome and a great asset to this place. 

He'd managed to get over 2,500 counts in - in just a few short weeks... assists coming out his ears, and a few ks.

He was a casuality of  the brief k's at all cost that ensued for a while - now a thing of the past - I may try and have him give us another shot. He loved it here!


this /bestof also brought

/u/Smartstocks to this crazy place... he managed to get in over 1,000 counts in! He's still around and active though he seems to want to count in -'s - so we need a minus side thread for him!!! :)

There's a whole lot more to this threads story that I will explore and share later for those interested.




---

p.s. I'm not even cutting and pasting these 41,387 thank you's!! 

Thank you! You are unbelievable! 

I know you are just trying to get me to say UNCLE - enough Participation Charts by rs\u2122.  It's NOT gonna happen!Note:

I'm just going to make a quick statement on this k and be done with it for good. :)

this experience brought out the sea of flairs:


#DON'T RUN THE 599k

by those who learned quite a bit from running this one. 

And those who participated in this and others - saw to it the next major milestone had **66** contributors, and could have had **266** should they have wanted to add their count.

So this thread in the end - turned into something very positive for all future major milestones. :)

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand that's a wrap.^^shhhhGood idea, that's the first thing I checked.

It wasn't around any major milestones here - no /bestof's, and no major influx via a FP post in AskReddit (there would have been a huge influx to the main thread with ~1050-1100 comments) another thing that you can tell when there is a glitch in the Main Thread matrix is when there is a significant # of upvotes to the thread itself.

For example out of the last 620 threads all have anywhere from ~12-~30 upvotes over the life of the thread depending on if hit was a run or a really slow thread.

Threads like the 

200k - **400**+ upvotes

another quick indicator of significant milestones, or mentions (like the BBC and Mashable articles - and my FP post etc) is to look at the UPVOTES on the GET - most have 6-12 upvotes.  Whenever anything sigficant happens you'll find 30-300 upvotes on the GET.

that's why it's puzzling me so much, where all other threads he's done so far have usually 0 newbies, and max of 5 newbies... this one has 16. 

anyhow - I've got to get busy making an index of the 120+ or so Participation Charts by rs\u2122 that he's blanketed the "new comments" page with over the past 30+ hours....
because the minute he does a run... they'll be next to impossible to find in his profile or the sub itself.  And I'd like everyone to be able to see the info on their first thread, their most significant thread, and any/all other burning questions they may have about this insane count to infinity that we are all on! :)

If anyone figures out why this one is such a major glitch in the side thread matrix please let me know via MSG because I may not see it posted here. 

If none of you are interested in solving one of the bigger mysteries of the side threads... I'll revisit this and try and figure it out when I'm done with the huge task ahead of me with these 120++ charts he's given us!

**HUG**

Whitney-7314

Howdy!

From what I can tell - you've loved counting BACKWORDS lately!! :)

Don't think anyone will see us here in this old thread... soooo let's do this! First to 5 counts WINS the prize!


by the way - you may not believe this but I actually got a SIDE THREAD GET!!

binary (whatever the heck that is LOL) but I've got my claim to fame in the Side Thread Hall of Fame and forever my name on one of the Threads here - pretty spiffy - see my flair!)

/u/smartstocks if you don't hurry I might have to start double counting and get my poor self BANNED!-7312

check that

pssst you've counted over 1,000 times just in the Main thread here - I don't think you need me to show you how! LOL-7310

THWAP!!!!!!!!!

Hang tight and I will teach you HOW to count RFLMAO.....

typing.......

ok so the KEY is to add a NUMBER to your comment - since we are counting backword your number 

where you typed "I'm lost"

#-7313 

(see that's ONE less than my number - have I lost you yet...)

lemme know if you need me to show you how to EDIT a post and "check that" missing number :)

Says someone who's counted 90% less than you just in the main thread....


you appear to be trying to play that TUG of war game - this is me and you counting BACKWARDS since it appears to be your favorite hobby lately... first to count 5 numbers WINS the grand prize!

lemme know if you need me to teach you what your -7313 above THIS number should be - I'm all for helping "newbies" :)-7308

YOU GOT ONE RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

WoooHooo!!!

do I need to call in atom to check-yo-above incorrect #'s :)

#HINT-

your next number is ONE LESS than mine - if you need to grab your calculator for this - feel free I can wait.

I sure hope you are just flipping me shit - I mean if you are not - you need to slow down on that bottle!!!!

Ok looks like we don't need atom - you are starting to get the hang of counting!!! :) 

Good thing it only took you ~1030+ times to get this down!I think I should GILD this - you picked up on how to subtract by one really quick!! 

You my man are a genius!!

You did it! 

:)

Thanks - this was a blast - now go back to addition I don't think you are quite ready yet for this subtraction thingy....

**HUG**

WhitneyWhew - I'm glad we weren't counting to -7300 - this could have fried your brain!

#THWAP!! 

Silly silly man!/u/SmartStocks

saving this for the history books :)

Happy counting you crazy crazy man... :)
psssst check this out 

he learned to subract!!!!Sooo anytime anyone checks out one of the MOST significant threads of all time here - they may come across this little counting session... :)

That'll be fun! 

p.s. look me up when you've got this subtraction thingy down pat and we'll do 100 counts!! :)
It's fitting you had your first count in this thread - and now you've learned how to subtract in this same thread almost 2 months later!

This thread will be in the 

Thread Participation Chart Index soon - so keep an eye out for it... your first count ever is right here :)

**HUG**


Whitney.can you link /u/torncolours to the last thread so he can see how this works - he seems interested ... I'm so scared of this mathy stuff I'm getting hives just posting this here!!##CONGRATS!!!!

This is the most BIZARRE GET I've *ever* seen here like NOBODY wanted EVENS! 

LOL!

P.S. if anyone wants to see the struggle to find ANYONE who wanted on evens it starts here and continues up to around 950ish LOL. I've seen around 300 run ups to a k never seen anything like this... 
[EVENS??](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3vvufk/622k_counting_thread/cxs8sg0)Sorry Shoe - they were all trying to help you get this k but apparently you didn't want it?


:)

ok sorry - I've never even read one of these threads before... I just click that little upvote arrow and move on.

I am sure they'd love to have you join this thread! 

(a great place to be for when the main thread is doing a "run' - ie those crazy 2-3 second reply guys!)

Anyhow - I'm running from this thread before I catch something!! 

p.s. I got my first GET here ever yesterday!! :)

Happy counting hun! :)
Well if I had realized nobody would step up and try for this k - I might have tried for it..

since *nobody* seemed interested in it my **12** second reply time would have taken me far.

but then I don't have a burning desire for a k here of my own anytime soon.

I'm just waiting for username and dudebro to get theirs - :)

glad you got this though - we all really appreciate you - see my most recent gilded comment (er Whit4You actually)

LOL

EDIT:  Tip for anyone popping in to see this get 

Next time you are in the upper 900's and *nobody* wants it - try a username mention for /u/a-username-for-me or ~~/u/dudebroshitpants~~ - ~~they both~~  she would love to have ~~their~~ her first k :)beat with 2 sec? 

how many 2 second GET attempts have you had or do you know?LOL thanks!

That was a mistype :)

idunno was actually the FIRST in this group of these getting their k's with a **9** second k :)

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3vvufk/622k_counting_thread/cxrektv

thanks for being the King Mistake Pointer-Outer

btw I got a kick out of that sweet newbie trying to correct you the other day :)

I tipped him off you had a few more counts then us 

to the tune of

**60,000+**

LOLI don't blame you this thread isn't for everyone!! 

I haven't the first clue what-the-hell they are doing :)

Have you tried the sheep thread?

it's got a whole website dedicated to it (I made it)

www.sidethreaddocs.com

anyhow 

have a great night hun! :)

If you get a minute scroll back to mid (I think) ~~900's~~ and watch them all trying NOT to be on even's - oddest run up to a k I've seen here :)

actually the struggle to find someone to take evens began even before the 900's LOL :)

[EVENS??](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3vvufk/622k_counting_thread/cxs8sg0)

Manaic!! 

Check out the last GET - since they couldn't find *anyone* who wanted on evens for this get... they battled it out both with **2** second replies... you could have HAD this one!! 2 seconds - slow pokes!! :)

LOLI spent HOURS yesterday saving all 120+ charts he posted so I can make an INDEX for them for 2 click access to any K - your first, significant ones, any all info you'd like to see.

Check his profile if you haven't seen them - he's amazing! 

I'm pretty sure box is the only one who's gotten a 1 second k (possibly I could be wrong though but I seem to remember him posting a chart with  only box's name on it)

p.s did you see I got an ACTUAL GET? (side thread one)Oh yup sorry I remember that - it's been a really long night for me - I had to save all those threads he made before there was a run in the main thread or him doing a run (either of those would have made those 120+ charts really hard to access. 

So my brain is fried from working like 12 hours on that - that GET and your message about the HoST seem like weeks ago now :)

Oh and I'm about to add 3 more k's to my flair... got my notepad++ fired up again!&gt; i want a bot that just removes the numbers and leaves the text in order

Howdy hun... :) 

I pretty much read everything posted here when I get around to it (unless they've done a run or two and I can't scroll back that far)

anyhow - I noticed you are interested in a stat (one I've been wanting for a long time)

I don't know if you've met him yet but

/u/rschaosid is the Stat Man here - so if you'd like a stat done you should use the format I just did to "summon" him.  

However he's queued queued queued queued stats for a while now... see /r/countingprank Prank rs -  for some of the reasons why LOL.

We also have a up and coming stat man who's been doing some great things here lately working with rs's ideas and helping make them happen for the side threads.


Anyhow so if you make a request to /u/idunnowhy9000 if he can do it for you (all of us) he will probably be able to get to it soon!

Wow - I can't believe it took me this long to see my GET in the HoST - I don't know what that # next to my name means

(I did a screenshot.. I like my name being at the bottom instead of in the middle somewhere LOL)

Thanks for adding me :)

And thanks for ALL the work you do here!! :)

Noticed your stats in the Hall of Gold 

BTW have you noticed there are over 60 GILDINGS there in the past month?

&gt; ooooooooh- I see a scandal!

That's not the only one around these parts... check out this comment by Moo at 620,317

EDIT: checking now for a prank whit sub....2972 sheep counting 3240 words...our statman has come through for us all over 120+ charts in under 48 hours!!I haven't yet figured out where to put this index for Main Thread Participation by rs so I am putting them here for now.

I will be sure to provide a link to whereever they end up permanently if they do move.

I've got all of the charts posted by rs of late over 140 of them, as well as those by idunno - saving all side thread and other charts as well for someone who wants to do something with those...  after spending countless hours working on the sheep saga website with only one idle [here] mention ever in the sub... I'm not going to work on indexing all those stats .... but I do have them all saved if someone would like to index and/or anaylise them...

edits - 29Howdy guys!!

This and all the rest - will be easily found forever in an INDEX I am working on.

Smarvin I haven't seen you in what seems like forever! 

Were you here for the big **500,000** 

That was epic! :)

be sure and add a count while you are here!! 
Please clarify for us blondes types - does that mean they've told you what their favorite numbers are - or does this mean the ones they've gotten the most of?Oh well that number should be 43597 so it's off by 5709.

If you are confused here's the link to explain why: 

[43597](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3vblg5/610k_counting_thread/cxmi5bg)

I mean since it's by **my** name it should be a number significant to me dontcha-think? :)

That's my theory anyways :)

---

I've lost track now of how many gildings I've gotten here - someone is actually gild-stalking my Whit4You name (3 gildings in that name and I don't even USE it!!) LOL

(I've just realized I basically use the Hall of Gold as my personal BookMarks folder LOL)Howdy - now I am profile stalking you!

Was curious what your last # was in this sub... have you seen the website I made for these sheep counters? You will have to download the TEXT version on the site to see your counts here - it doesn't start on the webite till 2,000

www.sidethreaddocs.com

please check it out I worked very hard on it :)

**HUG**
Well you could always set some ^^^^boundries

You know like dropping in once a week for a "run" or something :)

You are just 2-3 runs away from the TOP 50 of all time 

(everyone sees the names up there all the time - so why not LOL)Well if I'd noticed Dude's comment before the chart I would have figured that out... I didn't see it via the route I took to get to this stat.You realize you've created a MONSTER right??? **Everyone** is gonna want to know what their most counted # is!!Two thousand, nine hundred, seventy nine sheep - counting the RIGHT way :)The spirit of counting sheepdom is to let everyone count the way *they* want here - unless you want to go back to the one who created this thread's original intent as I just did :)

He was here recently :)

He was a bit disappointed at how people just type a couple digits 

I have a screenshot of his reaction to the website LOL
Two thousand, nine hundred and eighty sheep finding that so profound!

&gt; by the effortless posts

??? I am so confused - you could have nothing BUT fun with this if you wanted to as I am with him now...

what's the difference between sayinng


sheep sleeping

and 

sheep

should all "effortless" counts be banned? 

if so the there are several hundred in the first 400 that need to be removed... 

ok that's my two cents - I can use my creativity to work with

2XXX SHEEP

try it!!while you are playing dictator - why don't you pull a bucky and downvote all the posts you don't like - like he did with those using spaces instead of commas.

I really like you but I just don't get what you are trying to do - you could have had all kinds of fun responding to him 
..

anyhow I'm deleting all my posts here.. cause they may or may not fit with what you want here.

I thought this thread was about fun not some strict rules 

EDIT: I'm leaving this up because I feel it'd be disiningeous - unfair to shiz if I delete MY harsh post...and his remains.

I just popped in here to say hello to smarvin one of the original counters here (along with throwthrow)Well I think it's actually kind of really mean spirited to tell throwthrow his counts should not COUNT - do you guys even know him?Well I think it's actually kind of really mean spirited to tell throwthrow his counts should not COUNT - do you guys even know him?

If you guys want to inforce the original intent of this thread then you should go back and edit **all** of your posts so the fit with the intent of the author of this thread.  Just like people stick with the intent shiz intended in HIS thread.

If you aren't even going to go with the intent of the original owner then why impose your person what *you* think should be allowed and not?

I could think of at least 200 out of the last 2000 posts here that were low to no effort... yet you guys single HIM out? He's a great guy!I'm sorry but I came here to have a little fun with ThrowThrow's responses and instead of playing along with me... =========== HERE ARE YOUR FIRST 10 COUNTS

don't be so lazy and spell the words like you used to LOLIt's all good - here's a link to the website where I put this whole story into a readable format - you might be interested in checking it out.

I figured sooner or later someone would mention it here... 

www.sidethreaddocs.com 

you'll have to download the text doc to see the counts you made from the beginning - prior to this thread :)

Take care hun

/u/skizfrenik_syco

here is the orignal intended format... if you don't want to go with what the originator of this thread  intended... and want to start enforcing some new rules... please ask a mod to make the decision - they are the ones who have the right to make/change rules in a pre-existing thread.

Take care hun!
I know hun - :)

That's why I got so defensive for you!!syco's point was that you guys should decide if throwthrow's counts should "count" that's a mods call not his.

I have always respected those who started these threads and joined from the beginning like he did..

anyhow 

I'm NOT sorry for defending throwthrow - he's been counting here since the thread was created... he deserves a little respect in my opinion.

MODS = the ones who make new rule changes to long term ongoing threads. I don't agree with you being the ones to decide if his counts should "count" suddenly. 
two thousand nine hundred seventy nine sheep giving throwthrow a big hug :) 

Shiz you are a great guy... please just relax and enjoy yourself... and let others enjoy themselves as well 

**HUG**

WhitneyI'm just trying to show you this - dictator may have been too harsh but I felt you were being really harsh with him.

anyhow - take care... I've always really liked you... still do. &gt; Can we say this doesn't count? /u/zotc[1]  ...what're your thoughts?
&gt; E: I'm saying I don't think it should count since he's obviously not truly participating. Go ahead and downvote, but this thread is for making stories of what the sheep are doing, or saying what you're doing. Not just saying sheep.

Let's just let this go - let the mods decide if anything needs to change here ok.

"Can't we all just get along" :)

Nite all!&gt;Can you please put effort into this thread if you're going to participate? Like include what the sheep are doing. It's the spirit of the sheepdom.

&gt;can we say this doesn't count? /u/zotc ...what're your thoughts?

----

I'm not sorry for defending throwthrow - shiz is a bit of a powder keg and he knows that... if I was the "last straw" I'm not taking the entire blame for his choices. 

I could have been a little nicer but I was offended at the treatment of one of the orignal counters here - imagine if someone said the ABOVE ABOUT atom or Z3F in the main thread?

anyhow - I'm letting the mods handle this as should have happened from moment one.

nite zotcum I hope those are manly &lt;3's :)zotc - shiz seems to want to put **all** the blame on me for his decision to take a break (leave or whatever)

I have spent more time then you could **ever** imagine trying to make this sub better for all of you guys... that includes shiz and he knows that.

He was harsh - I was harsh... from moment one we should have both taken a deep breath and called in a mod. 

I'm sorry he upset me and I'm sorry I upset him.

I care a great deal for all of you guys and I hope you know that ... take a look at this - do you think this happened just out of the blue?

anyhow - please don't blame me completely - I feel I may have been the last straw somehow because I defend people... but I know his decision was not 100% because of me... his flair reflects me caring about him and helping him create one of the best flairs in this sub.  There's alot behind the story there.

anyhow please read this... this reflects how much I have tried to help all of you guys... this didn't happen by magic...

That's not what I was saying at all... at that time *nobody* wanted on evens they'd been trying to find someone who wanted evens since the late 800s!! ... it was very bizarre.. I can't imagine that ever happening again that's the first time in over 300k's that I've seen the likes of that. :)

Doubt they'll ever need to use that little tip but I will reword it...LOL


idunnowhy9000	375k-584k	**140+** k's participated in without a get


Sorry for assuming you might like a k here - you know what they say about assuming :)

anyhow as far as that thread I was referring to you just "had to be there" - there was nobody around who wanted this they were like struggling to get on ODDS. and so on. It was just basically an inside joke. The chances of that ever happening again .01% :)

I've been racking my brain trying to figure out how I was under the impression you might like your first k here... and then it hit me... the HALL OF GOLD! I check that puppy probably 8 times a week....

to quote someone we both know.... 

this sound familiar??

#&gt;It'd be nice to get a K.

#&gt;Been here for over 100 of them, and don't think I've ever been past the 900 mark.

#It's a shame only the superfast get the Ks.

NITE HUN**


Where I find ALL of what I regard to be important or signficant stats - the Hall of Gold over there -------&gt;  - :)

That's why your post was melted into my brain I've probably seen it ~20 times.

They are almost ALL there.3001

three thousand and one sheep over the fence - counting one to see my name in the stats

^^^I ^^^HAVE ^^^NO ^^^SHAMEWell alllllllllllrighty then-  if we are gonna get this specialized - what is the first thread that we *both* counted in? 

QUE that one up! :)##CONGRATS!!!

Just two thousand, nine hundred and ninety counts in the making of this GET. 

Congrats on the gold to - you are LONG overdue!!I totally don't get this - that post I made (with the huge bold letters quoting someone we both know)

shows up on my profile, and there is nothing to indicate it's been removed or anything...but I absolutely can NOT find it anywhere here...

so here's a link since anyone who reads this later willl be clueless as to what you are responding too ...

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3vvufk/622k_counting_thread/cxsljjlI have my own claim to fame on one of this TOP COUNTER CHARTS!! 

I'm tied with blue and nitrome!!!!!!!!

wanna see it? (it like most of them is in the HoG but I'll give you a handy link so you don't have to scroll through)

edit: don't worry I took you OFF the ^^^pending list :) Nobody's gonna shed a tear that makes one more down... just one known...to go! :)Here's my claim to fame on one of the TOP COUNTERS list.. :) read the comments under - kinda funny.

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3vblg5/610k_counting_thread/cxmi5bgWell if you are going for that one stat you mentioned earlier we should **both** edit our post - or you won't stand a chance.Note: 

The first thread ever accessed via my soon to be infamous INDEX.

/u/rschaosid sorry I don't plan to page you on these unless it's really important (I'll let you read these notes at your leisure as you have been)

but I'm really confused - this was /bestof'd and stayed up all day and there's not ONE new counter? did you forget to add the astricks for them or?


I am facing a major crisis though... if I don't get back to these notes until I get all these threads entered... how the HELL am I supposed to remember all 25-30 adjectives I already used so I don't duplicate them HELP!!!!!!!! :)
Well the person who got that k - was a newbie who'd only been here a few hours - he'd been counting since the 700's he was just so slow that the last 20 or so count he kept being to late... he didn't "snipe" that k - he was counting just slightly too slow.... there was no way for him to somehow know he was supposed to stop at the 998... 

they said he sniped that but how is someone who doesn't even know what a GET is - and had been trying to get his counts in... a sniper.

anyhow username is now the **only** person pending... chances of her NOT getting a k this week... only if she does not even try for one LOL.

I have to get busy working on the INDEX of all of rs's Contribution charts - 

[INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cxsffh0)

but if you have a few minutes - please read some of the following post it goes a LONG way to explaining what's been going on here lately..



https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3vvufk/622k_counting_thread/cxrektv

good luck on your goals (I highly suggest you put the beating moon as last priority though... just my 2 cents - there are several other that would be great to have like beating Iduuno's record) Good I'm glad it's last priority cause if you-know-who ever gets wind of it... you might as well wrap that idea up.  just like rs ever overtaking atom... he's making progress... but if he ever gets close.. that's pretty much as far as he'll ever get.. no way atom will ever let someone else be #1 of all time in counts here as long as he's still a part of this sub...

:)You know something funny... we've both been here for so long and this is **by** far our longest conversation ever.

I know so many so well here and visa versa but I spend 90% of my time helping newbies behind the scenes... you were never a newbie to me.... soooo basically I've read 90% of your post for the past 6+ months... but you probably barely even know me.

I started the TIDBITs thread which spawned the FTF - so that''s my claim to fame here :)

you posted your tidbits in august have you seen what's become of it?? Petty cool..


https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cwk5d40
Thank you hun!! you are awesome!

I'm on this one! WooHoo!! :)

I don't know if you saw my earlier mention of a request...

is there *any* way you could possibly denote in some what who got the GET for these charts.. like bold the person who got the GET - or use one of those thing-a-ma-jiggers like the astericks to denote it??

It would really really be helpful for me and the INDEX I am making for all your charts...

have you seen it yet - I just now got started but I have all of your charts and rs' charts saved for it..



https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cxsffh0#CONGRATS!!!

Sheesh usual I can rattle stats off on one of you big-guns without thinking.... but yours are so rare lately... I don't even know - I'd guess this is your second k in 30+ gets? :)

I can't believe nobody tried to snipe this!! :)

Manaic_34 you are SLACKING - :) Congrats on the assist - they are hard to come by lately!! :)

I'm glad you got your first k though that's great did you see my flair :)

You know you could have tried to snipe Moo - I don't think he'd have minded :) 

anytime you see someone with a lot of k's in their flair - give it a try.... only if you can at least do 4 second replies though.... if one of these guys is going for the k- you'd never beat them with a 5 second reply LOL :)

Noting you didn't try for this k... just a tidbit...

**HUG**

P.S. your first day ever here is now up as the first post ever in the soon to be ultimate guide to rs &amp; idunno stats for the Main thread...


https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cxsffh0dudebroshitpants[9] - 451,330

that's one of the best thing about my TIDBIT index... I can see at a glance someones first #

anyhow I'm gonna peek in on the sub and then get to work on this index of these charts keep an eye on it!

**HUG**

It was great finally actually having a convo with you after all this time!

**HUG**

WhitneyWell I know you read my last GILDED comment in the Hall of Fame... Manaic is probably catching up the past couple weeks on the rest of life LOL... I'm waiting till he's back in full force... (though I think he and box have both sworn off sniping peoples first k's for good (with possible exceptions or errors of course)

but I'm thinking... all other counters beware - he's got some snipe-catching-up to do soon :) If you do this you will make me soooo happy and it will help me so much with the INDEX I am working on for you guys charts to be handy dandy for everyone with just 2 clicks to see any chart you've made.

I have every chart you've ever posted here saved... :) dude 

/u/counting45 

will you to please let me squeeze in a count at 624,169?

I can't get better than a 10 second reply so unless you both stop counting one time - I am hopeless.... I'd like that # if possible... 

thanks :)

Thanks hun.... by the way in case I haven't mentioned whenever possible please edit these charts you've posted - rather than make a NEW one if you add up a new feature or whatever... cause once I save them - then anytime they are updated or edited those reflect as well


you are so great - I'm more impressed with you every day!624,206

assuming you both stopped to let me get a count in thanks.... I can get my 69 some other time

happy counting you too

good luck on this k counting45 - please don't stress though if the sniper man snipes you

**HUG**

Oh are we gonna have a 2nd 850-950 where nobody wants on evens - we just did that earlier it was the most bizarre thing i've ever seen...

there's no reason you can't try for the k's when their aren't anybody without thier first k's in the mid 800s + ... but if getting sniped stresses you out to much then they aren't that worth it there's so many other things about this count that can be fun and fullfiling.. :)

I'm gonna keep tabs on this counts progress.. if we really end up twice in the history of this sub with nobody wanting evens in the mid late 900's .... I'll go for it if there's nobody counting evens in the 990s - the only way I'll get this k though is if literally nobody tries... most of the time I have 12 second replies LOL.

I really have no burning desire for a k anytime int he near future I'd MUCH rather be on the exclusive sniped by Manaic club...

so 

/u/maniac_34 if you are around - keep an eye on this thread in the late 900's if I'm on evens.... give me a 4 second head start and go for the snipe!! :)&gt;  Plus if I can spend time helping some of the new counters obtain GETs that seems worth it as well

THIS - a million times this - :)

This is gonna be your tag line anytime I reference you in the INDEX :)

Thanks hun... you are back to the bucky I used to &lt;3 so much :)Yup trying to make a comment (not a count) but you guys are going so fast I have time I'll ge the comment in LOLbucky - if you'd like to keep tabs on your progress 

here's the last stat I had on you

45	/u/Bucky_Barnes1	1,802

33	/u/counting45	2,799

so since your return you've already moved from the TOP 50  

to the TOP 40... 

by the end of this run (273 counts req) you'll be in the 

#TOP 30 of ALL TIME

that's big...big enough you might get rs to update the hall of counters quicker.. summon him if you get a chance and ask him to do so after this thread (sometimes he will now and then he's just too busy(



I'm gonna keep tabs on this counts progress.. if we really end up twice in the history of this sub with nobody wanting evens in the mid late 900's .... I'll go for it if there's nobody counting evens in the 990s - the only way I'll get this k though is if literally nobody tries... most of the time I have 12 second replies LOL.

I really have no burning desire for a k anytime int he near future I'd MUCH rather be on the exclusive sniped by Manaic club...

so 

/u/maniac_34 if you are around - keep an eye on this thread in the late 900's if I'm on evens.... give me a 4 second head start and go for the snipe!! :)bucky - the only real problem with running 

are back-to-back runs.... 

and back-to-back-back runs - well the first fit I've thrown in my life online was over an 1,800 counts where not one other person could get a count in.....

but as long as they aren't back to back there isn't any real problem with a run (just let the other person know they can come back in X amounts minutes and things will be easier.

also being added to the 500 count club is cool so it's fair to try for one of those once in a while.

but I honestly do not thing you have at all tried to hog too much of the counting here... you are gaining your counts without hurting any of us little guys so thats good :)

I agree with you there.

I'm convinced that business will be one currently involved in looking for innovative uses for the material GRAPHENE. The possiblities for this material are beyond our wildest imagination right now.

Worlds first trillionaire will be someone who invests in GRAPHENE.  Mark my words.(repost from late last night)

Don't know how many of you will see this - but I just have to say ya'all are

##**AWESOME**

As most of you know I said I hoped you wouldn't go out of your way to get to the 500,000
yesterday (Saturday) - not only did you not go out of your way to get there.  You went way out of your way to *not* get there.  It was soooooooooooooooo sweet (and kinda funny how far people went) So sweet that ya'all still care about the old timers &amp; wanted to give them a chance to see this!

Since most of you don't see all that happens here - I'll give a few examples.  Several times yesterday there were 12-14 people here, and not *one* was counting in the main thread - several times there were many actively counting here but not one was counting in the main thread. In addition to that there were several here keeping side threads active and busy to intice others to join those thread and destract folks from the main thread. At the height of the 500,000 hype &amp; one of the biggest events in /r/counting history - twice yesterday there was an hour between counts!

I saw several other little ways people were working to keep things slow... you guys are amazing!
It kept reminding me of a NASCAR race with 12 pace cars holding the drivers back LOL.

8 of the 15ish old active counters have responded to my message re the 500,000 - a few of the others may not be interested, a few may end up missing it who would be and that's ok - don't think there's a way to have even all those who are current full time counters to all be here at once.

At any rate - thank you all, you are soooooo sweet!! I am thinking.. GAME ON - let the active counting resume. Psssssttttttt... rschaosid time to end your hiatus - thanks for your help with this hun!

Thank you!

**HUGS TO ALL OF YOU**

Whitneycongrats!

(even though I still have no idea how this dang count works!)

FYI: You have got to be the *laziest* thanker on the planet!!

&gt; A beer, probably.

It's a million bucks, go crazy, buy a whole 6 pack!&gt; BUNS

Damn! I wanted to GET this one... I won 'best BUNS on the beach' contest in Jamaica once!REPORT /u/bluesolid for comma abuse!!!Wiggle...

just checkin' out my new flair :)This table is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to complex for the layman...Too funny RS!!

I *think* I can understand that table!

&gt; going to sleep then school, please don't pass 500k guys

At the rate the counts been going today - I estimate 500k at November, 1st. (2019) Damn - you currently have **420** comment karma!!!

NOBODY UPVOTE SOS!!!

Kidding!&gt; Just turned in an atrocious paper and that still made me laugh. Thanks Whitney.

Aww your welcome hun! Glad you got that paper done and out of the way!

Waiting for this 500k has blown my "rules of how many hours online per day/week" completely out of the water!! Justifying it because this is a once in a lifetime event soooooooo... otherwise I'd have to stay offline for a month to make up for this LOL.

Seriously though - I haven't quite figured out why things are almost at a dead stop still - so many times there were 22-26 people here and no-one counting (at least not in the main thread).  Just not quite sure what to make of all this. LOL

I keep wondering if it's like "I don't want anyone to miss this ... so I'm not gonna count" being said by everyone? Just don't know what's going on - most hours there's like 5ish counts to the thread. Odd, Odd, Odd. 

Anyhow - hopefully we make the big 500,000 before 2019!!!  

&gt; I should be walking again in a few weeks!

Awesome!!

No one quite realizes just how long 3 months is - until you've spent it with a cast on one leg.  For me it was 6 months, because I was obsessed with nightclubs and dancing at the time, so I went out several times and danced in my cast... making my 3 times fractured knee cap swell up inside the cast.  As I think I mentioned, they ended up having to put me in a new cast at the end of the first cast.  The 2nd one they put on me was sooooooooooooo tight that I couldn't even squeeze the well known (you know!) coat hanger inside to scratch it.  It was that tight!  Trying to get from the couch to the bathroom in that 2nd cast hurt so bad... I had a scar for almost a decade from the 2nd cast as it rubbed against my ankle. (needless to say I had to go 3 months without dancing at that point!)

I should share the story as to how I ended up with that broken kneecap - haven't shared that story in years... it's a very interesting story perhaps I'll share it in the next FTF!!

rschaosid **[HIATUS OVER]**

finally!!!  

aaaaaaaaaaaand now my ETA for the 499k thread goes from 2019 to ~~20:19~~ minutes LOL! 

Well since you are both off to sleep - I am too.  Crossing fingers the 499k thread won't be done by morn... Night all!!


Thanks RS, still love, love, love these participation charts!!!

No new counters this thread or did you not denote them?

See you in the morn - crossing fingers that the 499k thread won't be over by the time we wake up!##**499,077**

WOOHOO!!

Hard to squeeze one in here LOL!

I made it!! 

Part of the big 500,000 final stretch!  

3+ years in the making...

EDIT: /u/zhige - yup, I'm the sub's cheerleader, not an active counter.  I explain why in the [TIDBITs](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3icvvd/counting_by_members_participating_in_the_quest/cufa4se) thread.  But I've been waiting weeks now to participate in this final countdown!! I'm sooooo stoked that we'll be hitting the big **500,000** today!

EDIT 2: Thanks for the gold /u/zhige!!!&gt; Same, well at least I got 499,992.

I noticed you got gold for that 499,992!!!

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/gilded/&gt; Haha, I really like your flair. Not sure if it's new, but I've just noticed.

Thank you! 

Yup it's new!!! I liked being referred to as the sub's cheerleader so decided to make it my flair since last night!Well if yesterday was any indication - you could have missed school today for nothing. 

I keep thinking to myself though - about them racing through that... even if they had taken the whole day to count that k. Likely someone would have missed it.

With so many counters here, I don't think there's any way to really plan it out so nobody misses it.

But I think when we get to the 1,000,000 I might make a schedule where everyone (who's been actively counting in the past month) can list when they *can't* be here... see if it's possible to find a time where everyone can be here for it.

Because 500k is big... but 1,000,000 - I don't think anyone will want to miss it.

So we can see if we can find a time when everyone can be here (it's possible).

I know what you mean - I had to sleep last night but woke up like 4 times to check to make sure they hadn't started racing to the 500k and I'd miss it.  Was really hard to sleep! 

There's a ton of time - I'll work out a plan like I mentioned so nobody has to feel this way for the 1,000,000. Unsure if we can do it but I think it's possible...kinda like company vacation schedules work.What about me????

&lt;pout&gt;Awwwwww 

~~#\#HugMorraell~~

#\#HugMooraell&gt; 499 789

Congrats!!! You were the only new counter who was able to get a working # in the chaos that was the race to 500,000!!

Your name will be forever in the record books in the 499,000 thread!

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3om8oo/500k_counting_thread/cvyjsqm?context=3##**CONGRATS**

I was expecting it to be you from the start!

You should change your flair now to World Class sniper.

You probably have the **1,000,000** typed in for the snipe eh?

##**WELCOME VISITORS!!**

this count to infinity started on June 10th 2012 and has been ongoing now for over 3 years, with over 7,000 counters. 

Here's a link to where it all started if you are interested...

I was working on fixing that link to the actual start of the count as you were typing that LOL.

They even have a chart named after ~~HIS VICTIMS~~ him!

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3atms9/hall_of_other_5k_counting_threads/csjq9f8Well this participation chart is gonna be *huge* want to be a part of it! 

They've been counting to infinity - not quite there yet but the big **500,000** is finally here after over three years of counting.  This count started on June 10th 2012!##**CONGRATS**

Your first assist!  You should add it to your flair!

**HUG**

Pssssssssst - We got one hooked I think folks!!!!Thanks RS!

Looks like 29 new counters in this thread!!

Wow!No bots allows if that's what you are asking.  Many here have counted thousands of times so they have their techniques down pat.   It's pretty hectic here today as you can imagine.  Most the time it's not so hard to get a count-in-edge-wise.

You can learn the techniques from the TIDBITS thread if you are interested.

Also - there's actually a thread counting throwaway accounts.  You should check that one out sometime :)

##CONGRATS!

Was expecting Maniac to pop up.  He must be sleeping now LOL.

&gt; 520,000

##**CONGRATS!!**

Wow you are on quite a roll here!  

There are some people who wait weeks or longer for their first GET or ASSIST. (I'll ask in the Free Talk Friday thread tommorow about how long most people took to get their first GET etc)

Keep up the good work!

**HUG**

WhitneyZ3F is a legend in /r/counting for typing *the* biggest milestone in /r/counting history - the first # ever in this quest for infinity 

##**&gt;  1** &lt;##

Nothing can compare to that - though I think **1,000,000** will be a close second.

As far as the first palidrome GET - a GET is "a number that marks a milestone"

While 0-9 are palindromic numbers and a and I are palidromes - since the number 1 and letters a and I are typed perhaps a trillion times per day - I wouldn't consider them "milestone"" palidromes ie GETs.  

Since he obviously doesn't care about GETs here - I'm just rambling here... 

The word palidrome comes from Greek pal\u00edndromos "recurring" and is defined as 

"A palindromic number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed."

So since 11 isn't typed a trillion times a day and fits the "recurring" and "digits" - personally I'd consider it the first milestone palidrome GET.  


We are about 3 1/2 years late on this discussion - your comment just made me think of how insane Aibohphobic people would be if every time they saw an *a* or an *I* in a sentence they felt fear LOL.  


Anyhow as far as daggoneit is concerned - his claim to fame here isn't his one of a thousand palidromes. But being the one and only person who's counted the number 
##**&gt; 2** 

I think it's great that he's still dropping in!



Now I've got to go over to /r/countingcirclejerk and see if I've upvoted all your counts - I think I've got most of them by now.  Figure I'll stay with you till 1,000.

Have a great day hun!

**HUG**

Whitney##**&gt; 999**##

Woooooooohooooooo!!!

Nice assist!

You are on your own from here... me and my upvotes are heading back to /r/counting.

P.S. I posted something to ~~your sub~~ a few weeks ago - don't know if you ever saw it. My mistake it's /r/nobreadsticks - I am blonde you know!

Take care hun!

**HUG**

Whitney - over and out.

Ooops sorry - it's been a while - it's /r/nobreadsticks

I still get you two mixed up now and then... it's been a couple weeks so I got confused!

&gt; 521,000

##**CONGRATS!!**##

I thought you were saving up your GET quota for the big **1,000,000** 


Or did you just want to GET a new record - because I think you have one.

**Most # of threads participated in.. without a GET.**

RS will have to check to see if this is accurate - he knows everything!&gt; I don't know about any more detailed stats though. :)

Well I'm pretty sure you'll have a record here for this!

/u/rschaosid was able to pull a stat last week showing how many different threads a given user counted in... so I know he can figure this out.

RS what I'm hoping you can do sometime when you have time... is see how many threads zhige posted in between:

[408k](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3akck1/408k_counting_thread/csf4c67?context=3) 

and 

[520k](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3ppzon/520k_counting_thread/cw9buex?context=3)

We should be able to make that the record - unless someone else thinks they have a higher #... I doubt it though, that's 112 threads between gets for a regular here!

Anyhow - if it's too hard don't worry about it... I am just a *record* fanantic. Always have been since...  kindergarten LOL.

**HUG**

Whitney
&gt; so just hang on for a few days

##**WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!**##

That's not how this works - that's not how any of this works...


Don't ya know - as our Stat-man you need to be on call 24/7!

We need our stats and we need them **now**

You realize I'm going to have to put Bon Jovi's Patience on Auto-repeat for days...

---

Said woman take it slow, and it'll work itself out fine

All we need is just a little patience

Said sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine

All we need is just a little patience (Patience)

That'll help but I'm gonna have to call my doc and see if she can prescribe me some Patience Pills - they do have those don't they?

FYI - we'll be docking your pay for a month for this!!

**HUG**

DontCareICanWait






What are you trying to do to me?!?!

/u/NoBreadsticks - I don't know if you really remember it - but you were the first person I ever had a one-on-one convo with in /r/counting - during my WHY?!?!? Theories thread.  

We had a little side convo going without counting and I was worried it wasn't in the spirit of the sub to not be counting... you assured me it was ok.

While I know both of you and who you are... like you are getting to know me. 

It's impossible to mix your personalities up - I mean I've lived in Ohio myself for one thing.  

But the reason I've often mixed up your names is because of that first conversation...

I don't know if you realize it or not but the two of you were "tag teaming" the conversation in that thread... it was pretty hard to keep up with who was who - it was a bit crazy for me!! 

It's like one of you would count a few #'s and make your comments and then the other would... [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/35ge26/just_why/cr4oh7o)

and you were both talking about the same things soooooo I couldn't figure out who was who... 

The other thing is the two of two were just one person apart on the TOP 600 thread when I joined so that also made it harder to differentiate your screennames!

I mean I know you both now - and your personalities etc... but I do get your names mixed up sometime when I am scrolling through the days comments. Until one of you says something that makes me go *oh* ok!  Like you and Ohio or your "QUOTA" - and of course Pixel is one of a kind!!

I'm normally pretty good with remembering people by their screennames - I mean I knew all **400** roomies in my room by name.  But I wasn't taking 9-kinds-of-meds back then, that's part of it :)

I'm really surprised that me using two different screennames here didn't seem to cause any confusion at all, even newbies have known from the start - odd.  Maybe it's my unusual typing style LOL.

Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo anyhow Remove the Removed from your name - so I don't go insane!!!

**HUG**

##**ACK!?!?!?!!**##

Jeez you guys could really confuse people if you were both doing this LOL

Oh - this reminds me of a really funny story - hope you have a minute.

In my room that I've mentioned - there were about 10 gals who "lived there" - were there for hours a day.  Anyhow one day someone came in with the name GIRL llll  - well the small L and the  big I were the exact same then.   So we all used various combinations of I's and L's - so when the guys came in there were like 8 of us with identical looking names.

It was one of the funniest days ever in CharterMember... poor guys!!!

So anyhow - I think I like you better in your "reg" name... before I go cray-cray!

**HUG**

WhitAnd now we talk, talk, talk!  

I think this FTF idea was one of the best things to happen to this sub!

Lots happening around this sub lately - two major events this week:

##**/u/rschaosid breaks into the TOP TEN for most GETs**##

CONGRATS RS!!!

##**/u/zhige breaks dry spell**##

After 112 k's without a GET - a GET at last!

CONGRATS

Now for a tip

Whenever I'm typing a message in one of these comment boxes - it's hard to edit it etc, I just learned this week that you can drag the bottom right corner of any comment box and make it as big as you want.  I can currently see this entire comment!

Ok - I tend to be too verbose - so I'll stop for now even though I have a ton more to share...

Also I love the saying:

Don't put it *down* - put it *away*Let's not talk about "inside jokes"

Let's talk about:

##**RAMPART!!**##Worked alone at a convenience store:

Paying the homeless guy a few bucks and free coffee from our coffee pot - for helping me with various duties I didn't like.

Hold my white privilege, I'm going in.Sorry OP but:

Every account on Reddit is a bot except youWhen you tell them you are not very orgasmic - and they say - "You just haven't been with the right man yet"The History Channel...

Used to be one of the best channels on TV - now it's basically just reruns of pawn shop reality shows."She's our ~~angle~~ angel sent from heaven"

Back when computers were pretty new - I went to do some volunteer work at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

I was there for about an hour, watching them manually type in their entire address one letter &amp; number at a time.  

And then type in various bits of information again and again over several documents.

I asked her if I could use the computer for a bit.

Over the next half hour I made about a dozen macros for their word processing program.

I then showed her how she could spend 2 seconds to input their entire address.

And another 2 seconds to input those various paragraphs of information in the text.

So she runs into the break room and they all watch her do these macros...

One of them said "She's our angel sent from heaven"

Made my whole month!

 You are right there!

Here's an awesome place to get documentaries:

http://dl.filmiha.com/Movies/Documentary/I've been waiting for Rick to call a buddy of his - who's an expert on experts.Boy you have that one right!

15 years ago minimum wage, entry level jobs were a dime-a-dozen.

Now there are 30 people competing for even the lowest level jobs...

It's one of the things I'm most thankful for - that I started out when getting a entry level job was a one day affair.&gt; I think Pawn Stars is ok as a light history show

Oh I loved Pawn Stars when I binge watched through the seasons, it was fascinating. But once you've seen them then they are pretty worthless except for the new episodes once a week.

I also liked Hardcore Pawn when they were new, except it really irritated me how much they tried to drastically undercut an items pawn value and screw over the custormers.  I also felt like 81.5% of the customers were acting out roles to be on TV.

 &gt; what's wrong with that? 


What's wrong is they are saying *they* know your body better than you know you do.  They are saying that you haven't explored everything with someone else. 

They are putting even more pressure on you - which makes it just that much harder.  

Men need to accept that every person is different, and for some women having orgasms is impossible, or rare.  

That's what leads women to start faking it - because the man won't just let her enjoy it - he is focused on trying to make her have an orgasm rather than just allowing her to enjoy the feeling for it's own sake.

When a man says (and I've heard this many times) "You just haven't been with the right man" - this makes you feel like he's saying you don't know what you are taking about when it comes to your own body and every sexual experience you've ever had.

If men would just accept that for some women - it's not all about the orgasm - it's about enjoying the experience. 

All but a couple of my best sexual experiences - were without an orgasm.  Some of us don't need one - and do not want to feel pressured to have one.  And do not want to have to fake one to baby his ego.

I could go on...

&gt; "Did you cum?"

God I **hate** that f'n question!  Never had a man ask me that *twice*!&gt; "Maybe I'll be the lucky one who works out for you!"

That's a completely different statement than "You just haven't been with the right guy"

The two are not comparable at all.

&gt; insist they have nothing to offer you?

Letting them know not to expect me to have an orgasm - is not in any way suggesting they have nothing to offer. Not at all. Men believing that an orgasm is the most important thing they can offer - is sometimes the problem.

For many (most?) men - their orgasm is the #1 goal and most would not be satisfied without having one.  But for some women the orgasm is far from the most important part and it's good for them to learn this.

Men are pretty much raised now to believe that giving a woman an orgasm is vital, and it makes them a manly-man to give them one.   So unfortunately they don't learn that for some women it's not a regular occurance, unfortunately so many woman have to fake orgasm to save their mans ego, or to end the pressure they feel under to have one... that men just don't understand that some (many) women do *not* have an orgasm every time they have sexual relations with a man.

Basically any man who's' had numerous partners - who thinks "No woman has ever faked it with me" - just doesn't understand the reality of the female anatomy and the lengths it takes for some women to have an orgasm.

When a man says "You just haven't been with the right man" - he's telling you right off that he believes he's "better' or more skilled than the others.  This means he's not going to be as accepting if you don't have an orgasm and will just look at it as a reason to try harder to prove he's the man.

I really don't know why you say that letting a man know you rarely orgasm is insisting he has nothing to offer. 
g
All but a couple of my best sexual experiences did *not* involve me having an orgasm. 

Hope this helps you understand why that statement implies he isn't willing to accept the *fact* that my orgasms will be rare and it's going to lead to pressure - which will lead to even fewer orgasms. Which will lead too....

Sorry - I'm not meaning to sound like I am trying to be rude to you.

As you can imagine this has been an issue for me   my entire life - so ya it's a touchy issue.

When I say 'manly man' - it's because there are alot of men who think giving a woman an orgasm makes them better than someone who can't. They think they are more of a man... that's how they act anyhow.  

I don't think there's anything wrong with being a manly man, I'm attracted to them... I just don't like the fact that some men will not accept the fact that some women are different and instead add pressure and stress and sometimes ruin a great sexual experience because they don't get that not all women can have orgasms everytime - or even most of the time.

For someone like me who can go a year without an orgasm - it is absolutely necessary to tell them this right off the bat.  It's important for them to know this information because so many women fake it that some men think all women have orgasms every time they have sex!  

The last thing I want to do going into our first sexual experience is for him to think *he* is doing something wrong - he needs to know "right off the bat" - before hand that it isn't him - it's me.

I also need to know before I become sexually intimate with a man that he's going to be able to talk about this and learn about it and so on.  Some men are so hard headed that they aren't willing to accept reality, or learn how things really are for me.  

There are many women who can *not* have an orgasm from intercourse - but so many men learn from porn and women who fake "simultaneous" orgasms that they just don't know any better.  

I had issues with this with every relationship until I got to the point where their idea "you just haven't been with the right man" - could be countered with reality and facts. 

My last two relationships were great because their was no expectation or pressure for me to have one - which in turn allowed me to enjoy myself and not think about them... making them much easier to happen here and there.

Anyhow - sorry if I sound like I am bashing men - I'm not. Most the men I know in this world personally - are awesome!

 &gt; Isn't a lot of orgasms phychological?

Yup can't speak for others but for me that's defiantly a big part of it.  The more they *try* to make it happen one the less likely it is to happen.  The more pressure to have one - the harder it is to have one.   I don't think I've ever had one when I was feeling pressured to have one, or when the guy was trying to *make* it happen etc.   Eventually I was able to find a man who was totally fine with me not having them, and wasn't expecting, hoping or trying to make one happen... that's when I was able to finally have one now and then (not that it matters to me - but it does make the guys day no matter how much he pretends he's find with you not having them LOL)

Society would be so much better if women were honest (even in some huge blind study) about how often they fake them...  

I can't count the # of times I've heard a man say "I've never been with a woman who's faked an orgasm" - it's no wonder things are screwed up - it's very rare to find a women who's *never* faked an orgasm for one reason or another!


There's a whole lot of mental aspects of an orgasm for some of us women - not so much for the majority of men.

&gt; Be they increased communication, foreplay, other stimulation methods, innovative positions etc?

I like your post!  I would think though that a man who says "You just haven't been with the right man" - isn't looking to promising as to any experience with "increased communication"

but the rest of that sentence is spot on!

With lots of experimenting with foreplay, other methods, innovation etc - I think it's possible for all but the most extreme cases for a woman to be able to achieve an orgasm sometimes.

My original statement though - is about a specific sentence, one I've heard a dozen times personally and know many other women who've heard it their whole lives.  It's the kind of man who isn't aware many (most) women don't have orgasms via intercourse, who have been lead to believe all women can have an orgasm every time they have sex.  Believe no women has ever faked it with them, and they've been successful with all women at all times. It's not really their fault they believe this way either - it's what the movies, porn, and some of the women they've been with have lead them to believe.  So they think *they* know what they are doing and they are going to *prove* it to you and they won't stop until you have an orgasm which leads the woman to fake them, which leads them further into their believe that *they* can achieve something that no other man has ever been able to do.



I've literally said this exact same paragraph word for word!&gt;**I've** recently realized that **I** start a lot of sentences with "I" when **I** really shouldn't.

hmmmm

I really think you should adjust that goal to age 40. 

30 is really not very realistic unless you were born with a silver spoon. Not impossible, just extremely hard to achieve.

If you make the goal 40. You can achieve that goal! Not guaranteed but likely!

Think about it.

&gt; one day things will get better.

It can happen!! It happened for me. Life was about as bad as it can get for a decade for me... I am now at a point where I want to live, and am happy to be alive.  And I'm able to find some joy, and fun in life.  

If it happened for me - it can happen for you too!

GOOD LUCK

**HUG**I spent several years in your shoes - I *had* to live because of other people.  Every second of every day I wanted to not have to live anymore.

I just want you to know that it's possible that one day things will turn around and you will actually want to live and feel good about being alive.  

You may find some joy, even happiness in your life.  


It happened for me - it *can* happen for you too!  

Just put in the back of your head that there is the possibility that you won't have to live miserable forever.  Because it's True. 

**HUG**

&gt;  I'll take it to mind.

Ok then how about a compromise 

"If I am *well* on my way at 30 - I'll give myself till 40 - if not I bail."

How's that - I hope you'll go for that - because I believe in you too. 

Good luck with your future!! 

P.S. message me at 29 and lemme know how you are doing!

**HUG**

Whitney&gt; I know that it's possible to be happy, and I know I'll get there someday.

You are right! I was in your shoes for years - and I can say for me I am now glad to be alive, and am able to find some enjoyment in life on almost a daily basis!

If it happened for me - it can happen for you too!

Good luck hun!

**HUG**

Whitney&gt; overcome with despair and a desire for death

I've been there, boy have I been there! I'm glad you didn't succeed in killing yourself.  Take that as a sign or a new chance at life.  I spent so long in dispair and desperately not wanting to have to live... and now years later I actually want to live, and am able to find some joy in life almost every day of the week.

It got better for me - and it can for you too!

Try to find a way to bring a little fun or happiness into your days whenever you have the energy to do so... it'll help make things more bearable until they get better.

**HUG**

Whitney**YES!!**

Awesome! Now I can stop worrying about you - because I know you'll be well on your way at 30 (if not all the way there)

Whew - you have no idea how good *I* feel right now!!

You are welcome!

I look forward to hearing from you then.

**HUG**

WhitneyYour story with just a few changes - is almost identical to mine.  It may not seem like it now - but I want you to know there is a possibility that one day you will actually want to be alive, and will be able to find some joy / fun in you life on a regular basis.  My life was just as totally and completely ruined as yours is and it's happened for me.  It could for you too... so that's something to look forward to.  

Knowing one day you may not have to feel like you do now - 24/7.  

I wrote this saying at the darkest point in my depression - put it onn my bathroom mirror and proceeded to ignore it for months.  But one day I just said decided to take a tiny, tiny step... and then the next day.  Now I have a life, occasional joy - some fun... and actually want to live.

Consider putting this on your mirror and ignore it for as long as you need to....

Whitney&gt; Make as many people as happy as I possibly can.

One thing I've done to make some people happy (it's time consuming though)

In AskReddit - I'll do a sort by TOP - past month and look for a huge comment thread (like 15,000 or 20,000 comments)

Then I'll sort by new and look for comments to respond to.  To give advice, let them know someone is interested in their comment.  Give them feedback on their comment etc. 

You have to do some thinking as far as which thread to choose - for example one of the ones I did was "Lurkers why do you lurk" - I felt I could help some of them become an active part of the community.  

I responded to about 150 of them over several days and over 30 ended up becoming active posters and being happier because of that.

If you like this idea - and need a helping hand to find a thread to choose - msg me!

Another way I like to make people happy is to gild a worthy post - for someone who's never had gold here before.  It's $4.00 a pop unless you buy a 12 pack  at $2.00 a pop... but it's pretty cool to make someones day (and in some cases whole week) for a few bucks!

**HUG**

WhitneyYou're welcome!


Glad you are willing to get some professional help - it doesn't work for everyone but it does for many! 

**HUG**

Whitney

P.S. I know sometimes it's hard to find the energy to even get out of bed... but when possible try to do something that you enjoy - that makes you feel a bit better each day. 

        I don't know you so can't possibly give you suggestions - but I'll say this - one thing I find a little joy in - is clicking on gilded at the top of a subs menu.  It's pretty hard not to find something funny there, something inspiring there, something interesting there. Some of the gildings are soooo funny!

Anyhow - take care - good luck with your CBT &amp; your post grad!!

&gt; Changing the world.

I know that feeling.  One thing I hope you've thought about - you don't actually have to directly change the world to make a difference.  Someone you've touched - or impacted can be the one to make the change or because of your impact on them, they can touch someone else who will make a significant impact on society.

I used to think I could change the world - now I realize just how many lives I've touched in my life and how it ripples out from there.

So think of yourself like the a pebble skipped on the water - notice how it ripples out in all directions.  That's you and your potential impact!

Good luck!

**HUG**

Whitney&gt; I don't want to disappoint them all by suicide.

You wouldn't just disappoint them - you'd devastate them.  Imagine how the one who's the last to talk to you will feel - forever - wondering if they said the wrong thing and caused it... wondering forever if they could have said something different.

As hard as it is right now - living is the best option for the above reason and many more. (You have 7 vital organs that can save lives one day - but you end their chance of living then by giving up now) 

Anyhow - as someone who was in your shoes and desparately did not want to have to continue to live my life.... I want you to know it can get better.

It has gotten better for me and I now *want* to live - and find joy and/or fun most days of the week. If it happened for me - it can happen for you too!

**HUG**

Whitney&gt; I have all these memories that do not stop. I'll keep trying. Best.

Boy do I know this - absolutely devastatingly unbearable. It basically undescribable and only someone going through it would have even the slightest clue as to how desperate you want it to stop.  That's why so many turn to drugs of course... I put a tiny-tiny-tiny dent in it with booze for a few years... but it didn't *really* help... I just did it in hopes it would help.

I have no idea if it will happen for you - but after many years the memories and the devastation that destroyed my entire life, my future, my dreams, goals, plans - *everything... has lessoned now. 

For a few years I started going an hour here and there without the anguish - and then a few years later I'd realize I'd went a whole day without it.  

Now - the good days always outweigh the bad - hopefully you'll get here too. If it happened for me - it's possible it will for you right!

For right now you should allow yourself to be however you need to be. 

I like the saying:

**It's ok to not be ok**

Allow yourself however much time you need - you'll have a 'better day' in time and then "better days" and then living won't be so painful. 

You said:

&gt; She made me feel like I mattered, made me feel loved, appreciated, needed... She accepted my flaws and helped me work around them and my depression... I was happy.

You do realize you can feel this way again - not next week, or next month - possibly not even next year.  But you absolutely can find that again. If you found it once, there's *no* reason you can't find it again.

I've lost *the* love of my life twice... and now I've been in a new even better relationship for 10 years.  Although I was devastated when I lost "the best thing that's ever happened to me" - I'm so glad now that it happened. If it hadn't I wouldn't be with the man I am with now - who's amazing!

You need to flush those pills now - because people can act totally irrationally when a wave of pain/depression gets too unbearable.  If you need them for medical reasons - leave a weeks dosage handy and store the rest offsite (gym or bus locker etc)  

As painful as it is right now - and as much as *every fucking thing* probably reminds you of her or being alone etc - if you think about it... hundreds of millions of people have went through something like you are and have made it through it.

Please, please, please take your time before looking for someone new - rebound relationships are next to impossible to work - if they are started while your wounds are still fresh.

Whenever possible keep your mind as busy as you can - doing an activity that really keeps your mind busy.  Reading a really fascinating book for example. 

So anyhow to wrap this up - please realize that everything you had with her... you can have again with someone else and it may even be better! 

Whenever you are feeling really really down - it's good to have someone to talk to - here's a link to a site I've used a number of times... please bookmark it.

https://www.7cupsoftea.com/

**HUG**

You will make it through this!!!

Whitney&gt; so if I do anything terrible to myself it won't hurt them as much.

Sorry but you are fooling yourself there - it wouldn't matter if my son or brother moved to Antartica - it'd still be devastating if I lost him.  I'd always feel horrible that I said the wrong thing - the last time we talked.  What if something I said pushed him over the edge.  What if I didn't let him know how much I loved him.  Why didn't I say this, or that. It'd be so hard to not think about this every day for months - years.

Every time anyone mentioned suicide on the news or on a tv show... I'd feel that pain again.  So many things would remind me of him.... and remind me that if I had just done this - or said that... maybe he'd still be here.

As if that isn't enough to make you think you should try hard to make it through this horrible time in your life....

You have 7 vital organs that can save 7 other people one day... so if you decide to bail - you are making the decision for them as well.  Isn't it worth doing all you can to hang in there till things get better?


There's more reasons for you to continue to live then the guilt trip I'm laying on you thick.

I've been in your shoes - and I want you to know that I now *want* to live, and have some joy and fun in my life.

If it happened for me - it can happen for you!

So please don't give up on life because one day you may be a happy person with a nice life!

**HUG**

Whitney
Aww you are welcome. 

&gt; some random stranger on the internet 

Oh I'm not a stranger - I've been stalking you - by the way you are out of milk!!

(hehe just kidding)



By the way if you are *average* that means you are better than a few **billion** people! That's not to shabby!

I do care that you not take the easy way out for your family and friends sake - but especially for your sake.... because I know first hand from my own personal experience that your life can get better.  If it happened for me - it can for you!

I have no idea how long it will take - a year? 3 years? but I do know there's a chance that one day you will be happy to be alive, and will have joy and fun in your life.

Till then....

Be good - or be *damn* good at it!

Here's a link for times when you need to talk to someone... they are awesome - please bookmark it!

Whitney&gt; I don't know what kind of pain I'd cause them.

It'd definately cause a *lot* of pain - it'd still be devastating. I'd always feel horrible that I said the wrong thing - the last time we talked. What if something I said pushed him over the edge. What if I didn't let him know how much I loved him. Why didn't I say this, or that. It'd be so hard to not think about this every day for months - years.

Every time anyone mentioned suicide on the news or on a tv show... I'd feel that pain again. So many things would remind me of him.... and remind me that if I had just done this - or said that... maybe he'd still be here.

You have no idea how much guilt they'd feel and how many times things would remind them of this - constantly for a long time a then frequently for years after.

I will tell you this though - I felt as you do at one time - but I now actually want to live, and have some joy and fun in my life.  It happened for me - it *can* happen for you too!!

Good luck with your future hun!

**HUG**

Whitney

&gt;I am living the same life teenagers were living 20 years ago

What?!?!?!

You apparently have no idea how drastically things have changed since 20-25 years ago!

Have you even heard of a phonebooth?? The used to be every 5 or so blocks throughout every area of every city in the USA.  Do you think they magically sent their money to the phone company every week? Repaired themselves? Installed themselves?  Cleaned themselves? 

Just in this one tiny little aspect of daily life 20+ years ago - every city had to have employees to for each of these positions.  Now multiply that by thousands of other now gone positions, the automation ie requiring less employees - of most that are left... 

Another example - before the days of automated telephones - *every* one of those positions now answered by a machine used to require a person.



I could list at least a thousand minimum wage jobs that were available 20 years ago that are no longer available to "your generation"

How can you possibly say you know what it was like to be a teenager 20 years ago? If you were even born you'd have been in diapers - not delivering for a diaper service!

Times have changed drastically since 25 years ago - back then a 30 year old competing for the same jobs as teenagers was practically unheard of.

Back then we had in every town and suburb:

Photo development store employees

Video rental employees

Camera repairmen

Phone repairman

Phone installers
 
TV repairman

Dialup internet installers

Drivein theature employees

Phonebooth toll collectors

Phonebooth repairmen

Tax preparation prior to tax software.


and on and on and on - there were hundreds and hundreds of positions requiring thousands of workers that no longer exsist.

Before grocery scanners - it took way more employees in every store.

Before automation - it took way more hours to stock stores.

Before ATMs it took way more bank tellers.

There are 10's of thousands of things that required employees to make by hand that are now made completely by machines - with 1 employee on the entire floor - verses 40 in the old days...multiply that by 10's of thousands of products.

I could list thousands of jobs that no longer exist that required a shitload of employees each because things were not so automated then and totally not automated for all the decades before.

On top of that something else that's drastically different for your generation than all the ones before it - a drastic increase in the # of adults taking the minimum wage jobs as second jobs.  And a drastic increase in the # of women taking those jobs that were stay at home mom's in all prior generations.

Anyhow - when you suggest it hasn't changed drastically - you are implying that it should be as easy now to find a job as it was 25 years ago. That's just not the case - not in your wildest imagination - hell your kids will have to view a phonebooth in a museum!!

Have a good week!!

Think about the 1000's of positions no longer available for each aspect of our economy now.
I was just flippin' you shit - I knew that!IKNEWYOUKNEWIKNEW

&gt; You know you can masturbate during the day right?

**NO - NO - NONONO!!**

Do not try this at home - it has been known to cause blindness in mice - haven't you heard of the three blind mice?  Well now you know what caused it!

Howdy hun!!! 

I've now listened to Patience 6,336 times and counting... I hope my response the other day cracked you up!


FYI - I am *somebody* now... I had TOP COMMENT in a decent size thread on AskReddit!! Didn't think that'd ever happen!

So anyhow - that's just crazy that you've counted 27,000 times in 11 days don't ya think?

Wow!

Just so you know - people are still learning about your amazing good dead a month later!

You are awesome!

##**CONGRATS**##

You should thank yo-mamma!!What was so funny about that rice thread - were all the people trying to figure out why-the-fuck the thread had 10,000+ upvotes.  They spent hours reading the thread trying to figure it out. 

It was so funny reading all those responses from people not being able to figure it out.  Laughed so hard reading those responses my tummy hurt and like everyone else I upvoted the post. 

As someone who's done alot of gilding in this sub - I would be really bummed if you remove the Hall of Gold - sure you can get to it via the gilded at the top, but now many think to do that? Especially in a sub like this.  But with it being on the sidebar - people think to check it.

It'll bum me out if it's removed - unless there's a real shortage of space on the sidebar - warranting a change for something that's been there for so long.  It's certainly not the reason I give out gold here, but it is an added benefit - knowing people will see the gildings.

Just my 2 cents.

WhitneyHere's a pretty fun thread to check out if you are still bored:

In other news - /r/counting has reached 8,000 subscribers!  

I'm also shocked as to how fast ya'all have been counting the past couple weeks - over **30,000** counts the past two weeks - wow!  

**HUG**

Whitney

P.S. Please keep the Hall of Gold&gt; .

I disagree!I'm disagreeing with your:

.You do know I'm just being silly don't you??TTTTTTTTTHHHWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!I can't believe I've been reading his name wrong   for over 6 months now (He was one of the first people to ever converse with me here)

I always thought it was riverride - like the old video game... now I have to readjust my thinking - maybe I have everyones name wrong!Well you could have corrected me then silly! Ya, I've always seen your name like that, now that I see it this way, I don't even get how I could have seen it 1,000 times and never noticed!  Just the way our minds work... kind of like 



Now is the time

for all good men

to come to the the

aid of their country.
Just checked that old WHY!?! thread - you are right:

I like your theories, keep making more.

Thank you riverride!&gt; how much does it take for you Whit?

Well until the past two weeks with the extreme increase in counting - it normally takes about an hour using RES to scroll through the past 3 or 4 hours and upvote all the counts done here for all the threads.  But that's because I read all the comments from bottom up (ie the dicussions)

Over the months when I've missed being here for a day or two and had to start from the beginning of a thread (in these cases I just do the main thread) and had to hit the "continue this thread" every 9 counts for 1000 counts - I'd say it takes approximately 30 minutes.  But I rarely have to do it that way.
I read really fast too, but frequently there will be more than one conversations going on in various threads.  When that's the case I have to do quite a bit of back and forth scrolling like as I'm scrolling up from the bottom reading and voting someone will say:

#BlameRS

then I'll have to scroll back to see why they are saying that... match up the thread they said that in with the last few comments in that thread.

This can be time consuming.   But up until the past two weeks it was about an hour in the morning and an hour or so in the evening.  

I've missed alot of upvoting and comments the past two weeks with over **30,000** counts being done and me being a bit busy with "real life"' as well.

VISITORS FROM /r/bestof  

If you get a chance - do a count here for the history books of this epic count... while you are here!!


/u/bluesolid - this truly is **karma** at it's best with your two epic gets in two days after all you've done / sacrificed for the little guys here :)

/u/KingCaspianX - we are thinking of you - sorry you missed this - you are here in spirit anyhow! **HUG**
Let's prank rs...

I've made this sub private so rs will not be able to see any of the comments made in this sub via seeing them in your profile... so you can plot and plan and help each other come up with funny/odd/obscure stat requests in this sub.... 


What I am thinking of... is semi-flooding gradually over a day.... rs with username mentions requesting ever more obscure and odd type stat requests... I think it would be really funny.

So - here's the plan.

It's going to take me several days to message enough people to make it funny enough... so I am thinking we do this on **Tuesday** starting at your time on Tuesday moring and growing more frequent and odd over the day.

(so those who can only be here on the weekend and those who can only be here on weekdays can join in on this idea.)


So between now and then - please think of a legitamate stat you'd be interested in seeing - but hopefully something odd or obscure or strange... (if it's just a regular type reques that's ok...) If you want to do an ood or obscure one and can't think of one - msg me and I'll try and help you come up with something funny/strange.

Ok so the plan is - so he doesn't suspect this is a conspiracy... they get inceasingly odd / strange as the day goes on.

So if you post your 

601,346

/u/rschaosid[1]  is there any way to...


BLXU

/u/rschaosid[1]  could we get stats on...


the later in the day you post it - I think the more odd - strange or obscure it should be...

I mean the reason for this is because if he gets 6 totally silly odd posts at once he'll catch on right away but if they increasingly get odder he won't be sure it's a collaborated effort to prank him as fast.


So if you post yours early in the morning - perhaps make it more of something someone would likely request stats on..

later in the morning a bit more 'out there' or strange - odd type stat request...

and if he hasn't caught on yet... at noon or later - some really out there and obscure ones would be really good.

and if he hasn't figured it out by afternoon - some really really funny/odd ones like

can I get a stat on the number of odd number counts I've done on even days that are done on days that start with a T

really funny odd ones so he'll finally catch on later in the afternoon.

We should have a few posting some of the more of the normal-ish legitmate ones you'd actually like to see - so you can do one of those in the morning and one of the really odd obscure ones after noon-ish.

So to clarify starting Tuesday am - your time:

**EARLY MORNING:**

One each - normal-ish type request (something you really would like to konw)


**NOON-ISH**

One each - oddish/obscure/silly one that you do want to know 

**AFTERNOON-ISH**

Any/all requests the more silly/odd/randome the better -  at least somewhat related to the sub and your threads - no holds barred by now - he'll catch on pretty quick if he hasn't by now LOL.


---
EDIT: We are still working on how best to "roll this out" - when this should start. 

I suggest the "morning-ish" start in rs's time zone - meaning starting around 7:00 EST and ending around 11:00 EST. 

Then the noon-ish type stat request start at around 11:00 EST to 2:00 EST. 

After 2:00 EST = the oddest/silliest/strangest sub related stat requests begin...


You can check here for latest updates prior to Tuesday. [updates](https://www.reddit.com/r/CountingPrank/comments/3ujtzf/please_check_this_thread_before_tuesday_for_any/)
Howdy!! I'm busy working on adding people who can view this sub - perhaps you can think of some funny examples

No no no this has to be a big secret!!/u/a-username-for-me

/u/KingCaspianX

/u/NoBreadsticksYes!! You are here! I think this will be really hilarious - especially if he doesn't catch on till noonish when they start getting more strange!!

Looks like we have ~~3~~ 7 in so far... that's why I want to make this for Tuesday - so everyone who wants in on this prank... can be :)

I still have  some people to add to the list though -:)Well I don't know - because I figured my text box one would be lost for anyone who doesn't sort by "old"

/u/silverlava

/u/dudebroshitpants

/u/davidjl123Yes!!! Good idea - or make yours slightly MORE complex... than the first request was...LOL!!!

P.S. its good to see my convoluted post was well understood - ie the time of day for the semi-normal - odd - really odd.

I wasn't sure that was clear enough since I tend to ramble a bit - seems you got it so likely everyone will!That's a good one... one of the early morning type ones as it's more of a normal legit one... hopefully you can thing of a noonish-early afternoon odd/funny/silly one to go with that one :)&gt; Which user counts solely in the main thread and has the most counts?

I really like this one!!  I want to know this one now LOL can't wait till tuesday!I like the Maniac one!  (woodchuck naaa he'd catch on too easily if it's not at all about the sub and it's stats I think)

I also would love to know how many side threads there are - and hope one day there will be a list of all those who've counted in them..

LOL soooo tempted to write a very verbose post in regards to your above comment about me being long-winded... I so would but I'm sort of trying to keep up here.

I was thinking some would really like this prank but wasn't expecting such a great early reception to the idea!

I am still not even done approving/ inviting yet and it sounds like we already have enough to make this happen!

WooHoo!!

I so hope he doesn't catch on right away - it'd be funny to see some of the noon-ish - early after noon bizarre ones start to roll in.The sub is private - only those who are approved submitters can see the posts here - or see the posts via viewing someones profile...

Sign on another name and you should notice you can't see any of my posts here (or yours for that matter)

That's supposed to be how it works anyhow - I know you can't see my posts in the GilderGild in my profile...Love the most "349s" for a noon-ish type one!!!

the palidrome assist one is hiliarious - it's more of a noon-ish type one but I dunno it's wayyy  too funny to not be done soooooo maybe a morning one.No you can't see any posts in a private sub unless you are an approved submitter./u/-WPD-

/u/sbb618

/u/idunnowhy9000Well looks like you are not going to have a problem coming up with ideas.... I do think each person should ask no more than one in the morn - and one in the noon-ish or afternoon... or he'll catch on to fast if he gets like 10 people asking 5 questions in the first few hours. :)

Like I've mentioned - never pulled off a prank like this before soooooo just thinking of how best to do it without him catching on before several people have got to join in the prank..

so I'm thinking one request in the morning per prankster - then as the day goes on the number of requests and oddness of them increases... 

in the end - I think I'll be listing all the funny noonish-afternoon type silly/odd/obscure ones to the

www.sidethreaddocs.com so people can see them later :)

That's a great one!! (be sure he does this one after the hubbub is over - /r/trees would love to see this stat)  if you do it at noon-ish or afternoon - you should perhaps add "and how many counts contain the # 420 in it (including all the 420,XXX counts)

Just thinkin'  I like this one!! :)&gt; Who has counted the most sevens?

That's a great afternoon-ish type one! Very funny :)Um - nope - think he'd figure out the prank the *second* a Q like that is asked LOL :)

I'm hoping he starts out suspecting a little... then more.. then he has little doubt...then he KNOWS he's being pranked. 

(hopeing that's how it'll turn out anyhow...)I'm sorry hun - I don't think there is anyway possible to schedule it so every person who can possibly be here can be... like the 499,000 thread etc.

I'll be sure and do all I can to make it so those who miss it can see how it plays out.
(kinda like how I posted the sheep saga... I can post the rising prank and how he responds and so on as the prank progresses for those not here to read when they are able too)



Perhaps if there are only a few of you who can't be here we can find someone else to post your clever - silly obscure stat you'd like to see asked (I think I can make this happen)


Maybe you won't be missing out at all - this is my first major prank in my life and without being too controlling in how it plays out  - he may figure it out in the first 40 minutes that morn.  

If the requests / queries etc aren't done gradually and increasing over time it won't take him long to go from thinking - this is alot of requests to - somethings going on here.  LOL :) 

If it happens to turn out awesome, hilarious and something you and a few others would really have enjoyed seeing - I'll take the time to make sure you aren't totally left out with a play-by-play type story line.

Ok 

**HUG**



Oh!!! I've got mine... (wasn't sure if I'd post one or not since I am on hiatus - but I want to play a part in this lol)
I think mine is a noon-ish type stat... not too far out there that he'd know immediately that something is up.

601,XXX

/u/rschaosid [1] can I get a stat on how many stat requests you've completed?


 &gt;some sort of global time

Great point!!

We are still working on how best to "roll this out" - when this should start. 

I suggest the "morning-ish" start in rs's time zone - meaning starting around 7:00ish EST and ending around 11:00 EST. 

Then the noon-ish type stat request start at around 11:00ish EST to 1:00 EST. 

Then after 1:00ish EST the really silly/odd/eccentric requests begin.


please upvote this if you see it so I know some/most know to start in the same time zone rather than your own timezone. TY

**HUG**

the TL;DR:

rs can't see this sub or the convo's here - including in your profile.

Tuesday morning EST - ask rs for an interesting stat that you'd really like to know the statistics on.

Tueseday noon or later EST ask rs for a sillier/more obscure / odd statistic relating to the sub in some way.
&gt; UTC

It looks like UTC is 5 hours ahead of EST.  

So I think 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm UTC would be the same as 8:00 am to 9:00 am EST.

I'm honestly clueless as to time zones, have never travelled so have never had to learn that.

If my guess as to the conversion above is wrong - I'll have an update in the final update for this prank plan before Tuesday morn here:

[UPDATES](https://www.reddit.com/r/CountingPrank/comments/3ujtzf/please_check_this_thread_before_tuesday_for_any/)

Thanks!

re: TIMEZONES

I've looked into how to best syncronize this prank.. from what I can tell the UTC clock

http://www.worldtimeserver.com/current_time_in_UTC.aspx

Will be at 1:00 pm or 2:00 pm when this prank should start ie 8:00 am - 9:00 am EST?

If this is incorrect can someone please share details on how to tell when "early morning" - "noonish" and "afternoon" is EST based on the UTC clock?

Morning ish will be 1-2 pm on the UTC clock

Noon ish - will be 3-4 pm on the UTC clock

and afternoon ish will be 5-6 pm on the UTC clock


If you are unable to undersand this it's fine... for this prank to best work, the more spread out the requests are the better.  So if a few are too early  or a bit late... that's a good thing! :)

Awesome!

I will have to think if we need to tweak the plan since rs is now aware (or at least suspects) that there is a plan in the air to prank him.

I think we should still do it for sure... keep an eye out on the UPDATE thread before tuesday to see if we have to change it a bit now that he may be looking for a prank 

EVO &lt;3 - it's ok! :)We don't know for sure exactly what he saw &amp; didn't see or if he "got it" -  the deletions were happening pretty fast-  so perhaps the cover isn't blown. 

If he tries to figure it out by checking peoples profiles he will see NOTHING - nothing said in this sub shows up in our profiles.

So anyhow - he knows somegthing is going on but this close to christmas - he's likely to suspect it's something to do with a present for him. 

That would be my first thought.
For anyone OUT Of the loop about this convo...

A mention of the "prank rs sub" was mentioned and quickly deleted in /r/counting's main thread

someone responded to that then quickly deleted and so it went

rs was there and said shhhh

ie he saw all these deleted messages and knew something was up

this prank was not messed up because he now suspects it has something to do with Christmas - so he won't be hyper aware to suspsect something on Tuesday.

So it's all good

(that post / delete / post delete/ post delete thing was so funny though)

RIPGeorgeHarrison says he may have some screenshots - hopefully he can post them here if he figures out how LOL

Right - the UTC time is 5 hours ahead of EST.  
So the 'morning" - posts, the ones where you ask something you really do want to know - would be at 1:00 to 2:00 ish post time based on the UTC time.

But as I mentioned elsewhere - if someone (like me) doesn't really understand time zones all that well it's ok.  The longer this rolls out the better I think.. so if a few post theirs early or late - it's not gonna be a problem.

Howdy hun!  See my post to "river" in the UPDATE thread above.  And yes please post your "silly/odd/obscure" one there and I'll see if I can get someone to post it for you - so you can be a little part of this.  I wish you didn't miss the big events!!

**HUG**

EDIT: lol just realize you are posting in the UPDATES thread - see my response to rideride about missing it please

The reason behind the time zone strategy.... starting out slowly in the morn and increasing through out the day... is so he doesn't catch on in just an hour because of 6-9 really odd/obscure/silly requests.


I don't think he'd catch on with just two odd requests done earlier...  

So why don't you and Caspian both play your part in this - by posting yours as late as you can Monday night... 

I think it would be best if you two do "noon-ish" type ones... ie: not completely off the wall... 

odd/silly/obscure but yet something you would actually like an answer too.

(part of my goal here with the earlier ones, is for him not to waste his time - if he actually does work up the stats)

So before you two hit the sack on Monday night please pop in and add your prank rs contributions.

/u/kingcaspianx please read this msg :)

Those will work! Not toooo off the wall that he'd know something amiss!

Actually I'm soooooooooooo happy that happened - it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in /r/counting :)

rs popping up with 

shhhhh 

was priceless!! 

I think he was thrown off enough though - with the mention of "best not to ask too many questions around christmas time"


The final planning thread is already in effect:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CountingPrank/comments/3ujtzf/please_check_this_thread_before_tuesday_for_any/

This!!

(putting this part before the post I did earlier below)

I think you may be off by a day on when to post your stat question... if you don't see this comment before posting yours - it's no biggy... no harm done if he gets an obscure stat request a day early)

I now return you to your regularly scheduled comment:


Wait a second - this is SUNDAY are you saying it's Monday night in your timezone??

confused!!

EDIT: Tuesday morning is like a long ways away from now LOL - you should do yours around this time tommorow night.

To be honest - I really know nothing about timezones (except for EST being 3 hours ahead and the further east you go the further ahead they are...)

but I think perhaps I've confused you (sorry) - the prank starts on Tuesday morning (EST) tommorow will be Monday morning (EST) sooooooo if you post it now it'll be like waaaaaaaaay to early - like over 30 hours to earlier than it starts :)

**HUG**

WhitneyExactly! :)

Since you and /u/TheNitromeFan will miss it if don't post yours a little early - approx 24 hours or later is where you fit in! 


Your ears must have been burning I was just reading this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/35ge26/just_why/

You were the first person in this sub to ever talk to me :)  

/u/Maniac_34

/u/skizfrenik_syco

/u/zotcWhile I love your enthuiasm - I'm hoping everyone posts just a morning-ish type and a noon-issh time or early afternoon time.

/# 17 would be perfect for a late afternoon one :)

Oh and your #4 - I'm almost positive if you did the stat for anyone who's counted more than 100 times - I'd win that one :)

anyhow looks like you've give anyone wondering what to ask, plenty to think about!

Howdy hun!

I like your main counts to side thread counts one - sounds like a good "morning" one.  

Just to make sure Moo's 501 questions didn't throw you off... the idea I had was each person ask two questions... (so it's not a totally disruptive prank to the sub or to rs) 

So with that being your morning one - you just need one other a "silly/odd/obscure one - that you want an answer to for a noonish type one.

Or a completely off the wall afternoonish type one - like moo's #17.

By the way I'm sure I was there for you and Moo's first convo... back then I read *every* convo in the sub.. with just a couple exceptions (back to back runs since the last time I'd been there)

# UPDATE 1 - 2 - 3


# UPDATE 1

Please make sure if you post a morning stat / data request it's something you really do want to know.   

(so he's not wasting his time doing the ones he happens to do)

by the time we get to the noon-ish ones - it's unlikely he'd be caught up with older requests - to be doing them and thus wasting his time. :)

##**UPDATE 2**

This should start on TUESDAY for the USA.

Sorry if I confused anyone - I guess I'm one of those 'murkins they talk about who thinks the world revolves around the USA.  

Anyhow - if some of you thought I mean Tuesday for those on the other side of the world - I apologize. 

Currently in the USA it is 1 AM on Monday morning... so the time frame to start rolling out the prank is over 24 hours from this post.  (32-34 hours to be specific)

Anyhow sorry for any confusion, learning as we go LOL


# UPDATE 3

The idea is for each person to post one morning type request &amp; one noonish and/or afternoon type one. 

(not all 9-12 of you posting 10+ requests each - totally flooding /r/counting like that would probably get ME banned for being behind it LOL) 

Hopefully most of the requests will be included with an actual count in your prefered threads  - so it won't be any more disruptive then the **420** thread count was :)

Anyhow - stay tuned for any last minute updates :)
Yup #17 is awesome, no doubt if he hasn't realized for sure it's a prank on him - one or two like that in the early afternoon will leave him with **no** doubt LOL&gt;

^^^sneaking ^^^outExactly... from the moment I first started to think about this plan... I've always seen it as the more spread out the better (within reason of course) - because at first he'll start to wonder a bit, then start to think somethings going on, and then realize it's a prank (when the early afternoon really odd/silly ones roll in)

The idea was similiar to the 599 thread... want as many as possilbe who want to be a part of this to be... if all of them were to come in at once than only those who happened to be here at that time would get to partake and get to see the results first hand :)

&gt; What is this sub?

Hi again - sorry been offline since my last post.

This is /r/counting... where people count! Yes we realize this is bizarre, the sub was even mentioned by the BBC as one of the internet's most bizarre communities.


We are on a quest to count to infinity.  The count has been ongoing for over 3 1/2 years now, and just reached a major milestone... 

check this out if you have a chance (pretty fun and funny) **[500,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3olp9s/499k_counting_thread/cvyer7c?sort=top)**

So the reason I summoned you:

This sub keeps track when people GET significant numbers - like each 1,000 (k) - there's a chart showing who has the most k's and trying to GET one of those can be quite competitive.

It's not uncommon for peope to try and snipe (steal) a k from someone who's been counting for an hour to GET that k.   Someone has even made a name for himself sniping k's.

Now in order to GET a k (580,000 for example) - somebody has to be benevolent and assist them. Count the 579,999 instead of trying for the k themselves. 

We have a [hall of fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/wiki/hall_of_999s) that recognizes those who are benevolent and go for the assist... it's not really tradition here for someone to *snipe* an assist.

However in this case - after someone having counted for quite some time to do an assist - /u/rschaosid snuck in and *sniped* the assist.  Slowing the afore mentioned counters dreams of being in the TOP 10 for assists down.


This was bad, bad, bad - hence the summons of you so we could use a pitchfork on his butt!

Sorry if this makes little sense - the sub is quite heavy with it's own 'inside' jargon.

At any rate - if you could leave us with a handy dandy pitchfork - it'd be much appreciated!

Oh and of course if you have time, count at least once so you too can be in the [history books](https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=10000) -just make sure you are inb4 we hit infinity!
Oh of course!555,510

aaaaaaaaaaand I'm counting!!

Time to get my *count* on!

FYI - I'm finally in the TOP 500! Wooohooo! 

Let's save the fanfare till I hit my goal of TOP 300 though!

For anyone who hasn't seen it - I added some info about the fun goings on here the past few days to the FTF thread.

After the sub went crazy the last time he was banned, I'm guessing he won't have to worry about getting banned again :)

We &lt;3 /u/rschaosid This has been a pretty bizarre week too - don't recall having a week as eventful as this ever before - I did a write up about it in the FTF.  (might have been a few before my time though)You would fit right in at /r/counting - drop in sometime!/r/conspiracyno

--removedpixelWoohoo!! You made it! 

Welcome to the sub 99999999999999999999999999999999999989!!

edit: guys please slow down a minute so he can get a # in that 'counts' :)  I invited him here - thought his name was soooooo fitting for this sub!Can you try counting again - your count was a bit too slow.  I think they've slowed down so you can try again!

Ya they were racing (going really fast) so your # came after someone else counted it.  I asked them to slow down so can you try again?

Here's a link

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/3sfmba/561k_counting_thread/cwwtv78561,326

There you go - that one worked! Your name is so fitting to this sub - I wanted you in the history books!

Whitney

p.s. one day our count *will* match your username!First rule of the Me\*a's - you don't talk about the Me\*a's :)

You got in! Now you are *on a list* - I imagine you are on a *lot* of lists LOL.

Our count should match your username at some point... eta: ~~2099.~~ 31 billion centuries.If you didn't COUNT so much - you wouldn't have to update it so much. So no. 

#\#BlameRS^^Dream^crusherThis post reminds me of one of the most awesome websites on the net.  Check it out sometime when you have some free time. I guarantee you it's worth the visit.

Thanks guys for slowing down for our visitor - he got ~~two~~ three in! He might be hooked!!

I'm off to bingo in a few - will finish my counting later!

**HUG**

WhitneyWell I'm about to fix that blue... hang tight.

(I don't get to see the flairs for the eternity or decade clubs because I'm not in those ones)

557,444 is special because it's TRIPLETS!!

I mean if you don't count the 1,000 counts each   in the 111k,222k,333k,444k,555k threads... so minus those 5,000 trips...it's a pretty exclusive club! Not *everyone* can get Trips!!! hehe

I'm just being silly.. it's my very first number of *any* kind of significance so... it's in my flair!

Edit: I believe the eternity club is for those who've made the front page, and the decade club is for those over 10,000 karma but I may be wrong.You are welcome!

In case you didn't know once you are in the Me\*a's its for life.I think you are supposed to wait up to 24 hours... if you don't get a notification by then.. try messaging the moderators. (I think I did that and got 'spoken too' for not waiting... LOL)It's gonna be a while before I get to 10k - my other name was getting pretty close before I stopped using it as much.

Oh well I can wait... or post a few brilliant early comments in AskReddit (that's how I got my most of my karma on my other account)Well I don't think you have to worry about karma too much, you are approaching 50,000!! 

I am just happy to have over 2,000 - before that I felt a bit out of place in some of the subs I am in.##**CONGRATS!!**

So that's how you can copy some spiffy alt codes used etc.  Saw one with two drinking glasses earlier I wanted but didn't know how to 'get' them.

Thanks!!

Things are going slow enough now - I'll try and get my other 8 counts in.

Howdy Smartsocks!562,205

Won twice at bingo again -woohoo!~~######562,207~~

Being so creative with my count!

Edit: To slow - down low!Kinda fun watching two relative newbies running a thread for once... at this rate SuperDuckMan you'll be in the TOP 100 counters over there ------&gt;

Don't know how much you've counted since it was last updated.

At last update you needed 207... so likely you'll get there via this thread. Unless a few of the speed demons break in on this count fest!

Being in the TOP 100 HoC is pretty spiffy though! Good luck!Usually sometime after each k - it just depends on when rs gets around to it... but he updated it halfway through a k once upon my begging... so I could see me in the TOP 500 LOL.  

He'll probably kill me now for suggesting beggging works!!!562,373

Howdy mmooner!562,379

Where did /u/superduckman disappear too - was rooting for him to get into the TOP 100 tonight!!

mmooner - don't get the reference...

:::::twiddling thumbs::::: it's been 9 minutes!!

 Do I have to flash a little xxx to get someone to count with me??
562,381

finally!!

howdy blue!562,383

Howdy! Trying to get my 10 in at 7 now I think!

This competition for #1 gets is making this sub really interesting this week!562,385

good luck! - I noticed Maniac is pretty much staying out of this after his big snipe on Atom's attempt to get back on top the other night

one more...562,388

Hopefully so - I'm just really happy to see you both displaying such good sportsmanship in such a heated competition! That makes me very happy!

Ok - done for the day... one step closer to TOP 300!

**HUG**

Whitney

Edit: Wooops - sounds like I'm playing favorites with my "Hopefully so" - I just think it'd be spiffy if you could enjoy at least a full 24 hours on TOP... ya know :) I &lt;3 both of you!  

Welcome back SuperDuckMan!Awesome - I really, really like this club...because it gives credit to those who step aside and let others (especially newbies) get the k's.

I've *always* been a really big fan of benevolent people!

(and no blue - this doesn't apply to you right now - if I were in your shoes right now - there's no chance of me taking the 999!!) 

Perhaps we can find a way to get this count incorporated elsewhere... I mean I have no idea how I even ended up here. 

Perhaps where the sniped by maniac stat is kept? 

&gt; I'm still number one

Hey well at least you are number one in something here - after 3 1/2 years and over 7,800 counters it's not so easy to be #1 at something in this sub LOL.

Someday - I'll be #1 at -  the slowest to TOP 100!! This is cute - we have FLAIRS actually counting themselves!!!!

444,444

555,555

at least you got a little consolation prize for your troubles - matching 8's on two charts LOL.poor /u/rschaosid he gets paged 30 times a day now I think LOL. 

I just hope nobody saw me mentioning earlier that begging works with him! He'll never get any hw done then!Spiffy#!!

WTG!

I think this is the most snipe attempts since the 500,000!!  

Looks like you were the fastest on the draw!  
Looks like you are getting rusty!! Looking back at these counts - I think it's funny only 1 upvoter...but 7 here for the snipe - looks like everyone was trying to use the stealth method!My x boyfriend had one of those - he got an operation at about 35 years old.  Would it be possible for you to post an update of the big hall of counters soon? /u/superduckman is hoping to hit the TOP 100 - we are anxious to see how close he is now.He gave it such a high class name too:

#"the letter counting thing"I'm hoping you could update the:

https://www.counting.acorn.pw/stats/hall?of=counters&amp;thread=main&amp;places=10000

So we can see how close he is - he was needing 207 when the last update was done.Your welcome - figured I'd do the beggin' for ya.  You are exactly 49 counts away good luck!

Thanks rs for doing that for us!Ok don't know how many will see this but I have to share something funny that just happened.

I have "Dont" and "Count" on my tab bar at the top of the screen right.... 

Don't - displays my profile and all my recent posts...

Count - displays the current comments on the sub's page.

So I'm half watching a TV show and half paying attention to this...

so I click the "count" button and I see this wall of my posts... and I freak out thinking nobodies been counting so I've flooded the page with my posts

(turns out I hit the "Don't" button instead so that's why it was a wall of my posts"

My reaction was pretty funny anyhow...Amazing all three of your gildings have come from this sub!
rs is gild crazy!! I actually had to blackmail him to get him to *stop* gilding me LOL. Too funny!

Edit: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!!!!! gilded *again* - he's crazy, crazy, crazy!!!
rs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

thwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwaapppppppppp!!

are we gonna have to have a gilding war???

^^^thank_you_AGAINLOL - Can't seem to get him to stop - he's actually following me around Reddit gilding me (you can't see some of them because they are in private subs)

Looks like this is going to turn into a gilding war and we'll both go broke! I mean this is really fun and very funny but man oh man - I have *enough* gold!!Well 1st - you gild me everywhere not just here!! and second there have been like 40 gildings in the past month here, so I hadn't noticed a pattern.

Soooooooooooooo guess I'll have to avoid using the G word here or we will have to have a g* war until you say uncle :)Good!! After I was done freaking out - I got a big laugh out of it too.  

Almost as funny as my epic anonymous g* fail (cant say the g word anymore) did you see that? It was priceless LOL.You can make another account and use it to gild - but I think Reddit frowns upon using two names in the same sub (I am pretty sure it's against the rules - otherwise people would fly up the Me\*a lounges in hours.

Like I said - I think it could get you banned. Think about it - if it were in the rules to do that, almost everyone would be in the top Me\*a's by nowMany of those in Me\*a 1 are Level V gilders and above so it's unlikely they are to cheap to spend 2 bucks or 4 bucks.

I don't know - I just wouldn't want to chance a ban. If you aren't supposed to vote on your own comments - why are you allowed to gild them. 

Anyhow - I don't know much about this topic - but since my brief shadow-ban the other night - I'm too paranoid to do anything that might get me banned from Reddit.

Reddit admin knows literally everything about your account and your alts - including PMs and voting history etc. I learned a whole lot during the 8 hours I was shadowbanned the other day.

Talk about freaking out for *nothing* - it was a glitch... took them 8 hours to tell me that while I frantically tried to figure out what I'd done wrong and how to resolve it. Sheesh!rs - when you get some free time could you do me a favor? I think you could do this in 1/10th the time it'd take me to find them.

Could you find the say top 10 or 15 most commented k threads NOT including the first ever and the 100,200,300,400, and 500 k's themselves. I say not the huge get ones because of course those will have a ton of chit-chat.

In other words - Z mentioned earlier about there being 60 extra comments in the thread - (this is because we were chatting so much)

and I remembered that's how I first got to know everyone here (only a few even knew I existed at the time from the THEORIES thread) 

I read through older threads with alot more than the required 1,000 counts.  Like those with 1,030ish and up) this is where you find the intresting side convos.

So it'd be cool to have a list of the top 15ish - threads above say 1,020 comments.

Am I making sense? if this would be too hard I can do it the old fashioned way.Xeam!! 

I'll message you ok :) It's heavy duty top secret stuff we don't want the N\*A to find out about or we'll be on a list!

Edit - if anyone else is reading this and would like to know wtf we are talking about just message me.Thank you - I knew you could find them in 1 1/10th the time - I have no problem finding threads via the HoF - have done it a thousand times LOL.

Yes I'd die for that feature - ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooo much!!!!  I'd do a 100x gold for that if I could possibly afford it LOL.BTW - I love, love, love being the cause of an actual glitch in the counting-matrix!  

One of those top 15 is because of *me* personally!! Woohoo!

To the tune of **642 users here now**

(I actually have a screenshot of that - my first screenshot ever - had to learn how to use imgur after 2 years on Reddit - just so I could show it off to the few who knew me here at the time!)
 

I imagine you are really busy but if you'd like to see when people here started to really get to know their mysterious upvoter - it's at the beginning of that thread and the resulting chaos of 642 visitors at once LOL.

They were all so well behaved it was shocking!

Edit: Here's where they started to recognize me (from the THEORIES thread I'd made about a month before) 


Whit4You
 
that's what I wanted to know - about a month ago I asked that same Q - see my history about a month ago for comments re this...


NoBreadsticks

HEY! ITS YOU!

and so it went from there... I was still pretty much an unknown here by many though - that weren't here that night  - until the TIDBITS thread.

(I don't know if anyone here's interested at all in seeing this thread I'm referring to but if you do here's a link:)

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/38c21i/388k_counting_thread/
the **TL;DR** - from rs 

"She posted /r/counting[1] in an AskReddit thread about weird hobbies. It blew up and brought a ton of people here for a while."

Well - most people hate it when their smaller threads get s'mentioned in AskReddit with their over 9m readers.

... and I casually mentioned this sub in a small obscure little AskReddit thread - which then proceeded to BLOW up and hit the front page for the rest of the night.  

This sub went from it's normal "15 users" to "90 users" and continue to climb with each refresh... I was totally stressing.

Thinking you know having this huge influx would cause chaos... and it'd be my fault. 

But it was really really shocking, it was obvious they were all reading the rules and totally behaving. I was like "whew" "whew" "whew' - and THEN - the numbers kept climbing... 

This was pretty exciting for me - you know having hundreds and hundreds of people acting because of something I'd said.

So I spent the rest of the night trying to help and guide them and give them tips and so on... several went on to become regulars... the most infamous (and coolest at the time) was BuckyBarnes... I imagine you've heard of him by now or you will anyhow LOL.

---


Edit: you happened to join us during the last influx from a smaller AskReddit question recently I believe...there was 150ish max this time. Not to shabby but not my big "642 users here" (patting self on back!!)


Since you are kind of new to Reddit I'd just like to explain - 642 means 642 here *at that moment* people come and go - so to have that many here at ONCE means a whole lot of people came that night and the next morn not just those 642 at that moment.

P.S. at least to my eyes your the most infamous of this new influx - with your **4** *count em* **4** gildings and your quick rise to TOP 100!It's fitting that the one flooding him with g***'s will be the one assisting him to his TOP 100 count.

He needed 49 counts at the start of this k... so he should be there anytime now!!

Maybe you can do a second midway update like you did for me! TOP 100 is pretty damn cool out of 7,800+ counters! 

(and 3 1/2 years!)Whitney's bright idea for people to start chewing on:

I think sometime soon there should be a discussion about what side threads would be good to keep stats on and what sort of stats for them as a whole and them individually.

Like for example - I think it'd be a trainwreck to keep stats on palidromes for the side threads as a whole. Because of the 10's of thousands of palidromes in the palidrome threads.


another example would be keeping stats on most counted and so on for the Throwaway's thread because it requires so much more than say "BOYC" - they find the throwaway, look into it's post history, compile an intersting synopsis of it and so on.

So in threads like that - that require thinking or ?  - it'd be nice to see TOP 50 counters or something.

Just a few examples... I don't know that much about the side threads so I have no idea... 


I just think it'd be great for folks to start thinking about what stats they'd like to see for the side threads and them as a whole. And what sort of "Hall of Fame items would be good for them"

I'll repost this in the FTF thread - just wanted to share it while it was on my mind.

/u/a-username-for-me - you are *the* Side Thread Queen - so we definately neeed your feedback and ideas! Start brainstormin' if you have some free time!I guess it didn't hurt for him to try - it's certainly not *his* fault eh hem - that he thinks g* rains non stop from this sub!!Yup I agree but should any of them be excluded? 

I mean for example I love, love, love /u/skizfrenik_syco battle threads - and they seem like a major hit.  But those threads (and are there others like it?)  would really really skew the data

I mean they were just typing

hundreds of times in a row... seems odd to me total number of counts to include those split second hundreds of times counting... compared to all the rest.

I don't know - just my thoughts on that thread and if there are / have been others like it.  

Maybe I'm totally wrong and counting is counting... 

I'm all for some stats *for* that thread though - it's an awesome and people have a blast. I can think of quite a few fun stats that would be easy to compile about that thread "longest progress freeze" for example.


I don't know - my thoughts on this might be wrong - excluding a certain thread because it's not - counting as 'much' as the rest.  Just throwing that out there.  If we exclude that - then maybe others would want other threads excluded... hmmm

Edit: Just thought perhaps that thread (and any like it?) could be included in an *overall* count of the entire sub.  And it and (others like it?) could be excluded if need be from Side Thread stats.\^5 at least someone can get rs to *stop* giving them g* - I'm not having much luck with that!

Have you reached your 49 counts yet?? - I'm dying to see one of our newbies hit the TOP 100!!Ug - we gotta know!! You can't make us wait till Friday!! 

We can repost this whole convo to the FTF thread (I've done it a few times before LOL)Exactly!!! 

/u/Xeam - deliver!!No - &lt;3 him - I don't want to do that to him... besides I'm trying to get him to STOP - not give me more!!! 

Look at my stats - I will probably NEVER run out of g* at this point - so why, why, why give me more. I know he does it to be fun and funny and sweet but I keep saying UNCLE!  

At least I've learned not to say g* - that seems to be helping LOL.

&gt; but they would definitely have a place in other stats.

I totally agree with that - if others agree that a few thread types might not fit well with overall side thread stats.  We can certainly accomodate them with some stats of their own.  


After all those 'battle threads" seem to be really alot of fun for many here (and total-stress-for-a-few lol) - so I wouldn't want to see them and others like them feeling like they don't matter here or what-ever they might thing if they were totally excluded from all stats!

I don't even know really - I may be overthinking this... perhaps it will never be hundreds of posts a minute again like it was in its first few days, in which case including it wouldn't skew the stats.

**NOTE:** the rest of this post has to do with stats/records/clubs for the side threads here - if this doesn't interest you then you'll be wasting your time to read any further! - happy counting to those exiting stage right at this time!!


##**I will make a TL;DR for this comment for the FTF thread - so read on if you don't want to wait for that!**

---



I'm just thinking out loud here giving people who might see this food for thought for the FTF discussion that folks will hopefully have.

We all have to keep in mind /u/rschaosid and all the awesome  others who help with stats here's time and effort involved with various types of stats.  The time-effort vs. the reward - and # of people who want a given stat.  

Some wouldn't take him more than an hour to create - some could take many hours... so the ones that'd take many hours should be ones that many people would really like to have... right? It has whole alot to do with a stats ability to be automated right rs?

I'm a huge huge fan of #1's and "TOP X" type stats... have been since I was like 5 years old in kindergarten LOL. I had to be #1 at something!! and had to be in the TOP 3 of something always. LOL.

Never really outgrew that. Judging from the intense competition for #1 in k's and those enjoying it - I'm not alone in liking #1 type stats!


So here's another idea - anyone reading this - who knows *anything* about programming and scripting etc... would be really useful in helping to discuss the difficulty of the various types of stats we think of.  I think rs knows some of you with prior experience - but perhaps a few of you haven't really mentioned previous programming/scripting knowledge? 

hopefuly a few of you have taken classes in this area and can give good feedback about the time-difficulty vs the benefits of various suggested stats?

I could go on forever about this topic - it's been fascinating me since my very first visit here... so I'm throwing these ideas out there for all of you who actually *do* the side threads etc to consider.

Good ideas for stats surrounding:

#####EXCLUSIVE type clubs/stats -  

like "sniped by Maniac = exclusive club here" 

and 

"10k count club = exclusive (and very impressive!!) club here"

so you get the idea any type of stats on the side threads that are exclusive, special etc would be great.

#####TOP 10 (and/or TOP 100 etc) stats/clubs.

Who doesn't like seeing their name at the top of something... especially a 3 1/2 year old project with over 7k particpants!  

So it'd be great to try and think of a few TOP 10 stats for the side threads as a *whole* and individual ones as well.

I think paying specially attention to those that would allow more than just those who already dominate the TOP 10 everywhere else to be a part of? So for examples ones that can be achieved by (more on this later - I think it matters)

Example - TOP 50 counters in the side threads. 

#####RECORD BREAKERS 

Who doesn't like breaking records?? So it'd be great to think of a few record breaking type stats for the side threads as a whole and individually perhaps. 

#####SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS

Like the stat made for us with the 111,111 and 123,456 etc...

It'd be nice to have a list of significant achievements for some of the side threads I think. Beyond just the rarer final GET per thread.

Examples would be the epic 

Farty's - smoke a **BOWL**  420 count it!

I just thought of one idea - a stat / list of those who came up with the idea for long running (to be determined by??) side threads!!  It's next to impossible to figure out who originally came up with one now.  I just learned tonight who started the letters thread I've been watching for 6+ months - he's here and counting woohoo!! see the future list for the scoop! Can we discuss this idea in the FTF.

Ok I could literally go on for hours but I think I've given everyone enough food for thought - I'll be reposting this in the FTF thread so hopefully I've given some of you a few brain sparks to get the Side Tread Stats ball rolling - but we all know who's *the* queen of the side threads so hopefully she'll take this ball and run with it!!

P.S. sorry rs - hopefully you won't be too overwhelmed with work after this!! it's your time - pick and choose which ones are most worth the time vs reward with a-username's &amp; others help :)

**HUG**

Whitney##&gt; doesn't create a sudden burst of overwhelming competition

Boom! 

##&gt;It would be a shame if some of them just went the way of the main thread 

Wow! Some stats could for sure lead them toward the negative aspects of the main thread.


Wow - all of this statement is profound!! I'm going to post it before my post in the FTF thread because I think it's *very* important.

And something for those who spend alot of time in them to really consider.  

I mean - perhaps that should be one of the #1 considerations in making these stats etc... addressing your very important concerns.

because you are spot on about the stats/records/ and competition having some real negatives in the main thread - *especially* when we have an influx of newbies every month or so and they have no idea that there's a speed count going on and give up and leave forever. Or they are so excited to get their first k and boom! And when they go for back to back runs etc meaning all but the fastest counters may not even be able to get a count in that day.. among other negative aspects of a place that some come to for total zen like activities.

so I think those who spend a great deal of time there should all be involved inconsidering the pro's and con's of any/all stats to be implimented.

I think your points are **so important** - I want everyone to read them first... so I'll wait till you are here and post my comment after yours in the FTF thread - if you aren't here I'll post it for you ok? 


I'd sort of forgot that some folks avoid the main thread and all it's ramifications for reasons... we don't want to do anything to take that away from them!! 


So hopefully ya'all wont mind my food for thought comments - but I hope those who are really active in the side threads (and especially those who mostly / only post to them) will have final say on any ideas / suggestions made. 

Thanks for saying this before I posted this on Friday - I honestly had *not* thought about these concerns you mentioned at all - I was focusing on *types* of stats etc... not the overall impact, perhaps some major impact depending on type of stats etc.

Edit: I'll make one suggestion I've thought of just now in regards to your post - I think it'd be pretty important to implement any stats/records etc slowly one by one - stretched out over time to see how they are working out for *all* those who count in the side threads. 

I do like the idea of the List of those who've created a long running side thread (can't see that effecting anything but possibly more side threads ideas being created?) - anyone agree/disagree?


(If I had a say in this whole stats idea - I'd say *any* changes in regards to stats/records/topX's etc for the side threads - should be *unanimous* among those who count regularly in the side threads that's the ~~most~~ only fair way to handle this) 

**HUG**

Whitney
Perhaps you missed my *meltdown* re the negative aspects of the main thread a few weeks ago.  I think it's the first *fit* I've thrown in at least a decade! They even named a subreddit after it LOL. 

 So I totally know where you are coming from and think that's why your points and your post is so important... my ideas and suggestions should be read with *your* important points and concerns in their minds at the time!


&gt;Especially about slowly implementing the stats.


Good - because I think slow implimentation is almost critical considering your points and others we may not have thought of - until after they are starting to be rolled out.  

You are so awesome!! 

&gt;I didn't consider it that much of a meltdown


Well I am a peacemaker by blood/nurture/nature - I pretty much live and breath kindness/compassion/caring - treating others as I'd want them to treat my child - at all times -  etc... 

So trust me when I said something harsh and obviously directed at specific individuals *in public* - it's was definately a meltdown!!! 

But - my point(s) were absolutely  valid... I just could have taken a 5,289,713 mile walk - to cool off and say what I had to say a little nicer, calmer, less in-your-face way - or of course in PMs as would have been more appropriate! 

It left an impact on me because it's just not "me" 


I don't really regret it though - I think it was important to defend the newbies and slower / mobile counters here - since they weren't standing up for themselves during hours upon hours on end of *not* being able to join in at all.

Runs are part of the fun/games here and something some love to do - that's great! But back-to-back runs, in my opinion should be the rare exceptions and with the 2nd run watching closely for others who might want to join in.  When they are back to back like that - that's around 2 1/1 hours where anyone who comes in during that time new/slow/on mobile are shit out of luck.   Alot of people can only count at certain times - and so if they've waited over an hour and a new run starts - they are out of luck for the day.

But the biggest reason for my public meltdown - is because these *thousands* of counts back to back - and hours on end of runs - was during a huge influx of newbies - (it was in the days after the 500k when it'd been mentioned in /r/bestof)

Anyhow - those I was throwing a fit over - are awesome people - caught up a bit and not thinking of everything... 

Luckily I reworded my rant/fit enough times that in the end they don't hate me now :)


anyhow my final word on this - since I brought this up again:

If I had *my* way - there wouldn't be any runs when we have an influx of newbies (40+) for many-many reasons - to many to even list. And back-to-back runs - I just can't see any time those would really be a good idea.  (of course there's exceptions to everything)

Anyhow - for those who felt I was talking about them in that rant (and for those who are right about that) - 

I should have addressed my concerns in PM's before I let the anger build up so much - 

My concerns were valid - but I am sorry for not voicing them in PMs - the right way for me to have handled it!

**HUG**

WHitneyWow - holy cow! 

Why in the world did 6 people try and snipe this poor guys k??  I know why you would at this time - but everyone else? Very strange! 




If I have enough time - I'll have to figure out why so many tried for this particular k - usually insignificant k's have 2 or 3 snipe attempts at most.!!! and this was all 'regulars' except one - interesting.

By the way - don't know if you got a screenshot during your (sigh-short) reign as #1 - because you went to bed pretty quick.

I got a screenshot for you... just in case atom never lets you get *ahead* again... you were the first to 42 so per the rules - #1. 

Here's a link for you to grab it.

I mean nothing compares to /u/xeams pic of you on the throne!! But this shot isn't to shabby!

Well I don't know what to tell you - everyone counting in that thread - are free to do whatever they want as they aren't breaking the set forth rules of that particular thread.  (or of the sub or Reddit itself of course)

I mean this is/was your baby -you created a monster - that's why I call it the "battle thread"   

If you don't enjoy it (or enjoy the intensity, or the built in stress/frustration etc) - then there's no point in you counting there. But how anyone else wants to count in it is up to them.  If they want to run back and forth between 200-0-200-0 with someone else while they have nobody 'battling' them - then that's perfectly within the rules of that thread.

If someone like rs - wants to block any progress until he's pulling out his hair and gives in before he jumps off a bridge  - or they give up and try again when he's not there blocking their progress.  Then that's fine too.

That's one of the beauties of your thread and what makes it unique here - it's basically give-in - or give-up!

Basically people are free to count up, or down, as many times as they want - until they give up or the person counting the other direction does. It's a battle zone that should be fun (in one way or another - fun to see how frustrated you can get in a simple game?)

I'm not sure how many times you sat back and actually *watched* your thread in action (refreshing the comments every few minutes or so for 30-40 minutes) but I have several times and couldn't stop laughing... after 120 counts, those counting *UP* had managed to gain from 6 to 10.  It's pretty funny seeing people so determined!!! And it's always fun to see just how long someone will try and stop them (for what??) 



And why? (It's the same reason I wonder why they've counted in the main thread over 500,000 times)

Anyhow - this whole counting 'battle' - was your idea.  So at least bookmark this sub and drop in at some point and see if it's still alive and well down the road.

In the meantime - there are dozens of other 'side threads' - you can try out. Or count in the main thread when they aren't doing some speed run!

Anyhow - I'm glad you started that new counting idea - it's been good for so many laughs!! Hopefully the battle goes on!

If you'd like - I can msg you the next time I happen to see a fun/funny intense battle going on in that thread and you can watch it for a while and see how funny it is :)




**HUG**

Well I'm trying to share with you (as someone who's been here for 6+ months) that this sub is what each person wants to make it for themselves. Within the rules of the sub/Reddit and each threads basic counting rules.

For you it kills the purpose for those who manage to count from 0 to 200 without any 'battle' - but for them, that's what they want and what they enjoy and it's well within the rules of the thread. 

I mean I don't bother to even watch that thread the few times it goes totally uninterrupted what's the point?  But as long as they are enjoying themselves then it shouldn't be a problem.  One aspect of this sub - and few if any of the long timers really care about karma (and they certainly don't need anymore with the 40-80,000 they already have LOL) but one benefit for some here is it's basically a magical-karma-carpet-ride.  So it's pretty spiffy for two people doing those easy counts that you say kills the purpose... that they are generating karma like crazy while they do their zen counting. 

See - I think for just about *everyone* here there is something they'd like to see done "there way" - the way they think it should be done. (like some of us struggle with the speed counters - unless they are going for a 500 count attempt - when they don't slow down for the rest of us who can't possible do 2-3 second responses) but it's totally within the rules here - and that's something *they* enjoy - speed counting.  So while we all hope they don't totally hog things with back to back runs (which takes over 2 hours) - they are free to do so it's not against the rules here. 


The purpose of your thread - should be those involved in the count  - enjoying themselves - and getting what they want out of it.  For some (most?) it's the 'battles' - for some it's sneaking in and teaming up with someone to get through the count before they are caught by someone who wants to switch things up.  

To you - and me - it's boring to watch 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 etc - but perhaps it's a bit of an adrenelin rush / exciting -  for them to see how far they can get before being stopped!  It really doesn't hurt anyone if they don't get caught because nobody wants to battle them (or are busy elsewhere at the time) - so they count up to 200 and are happy they didn't get 'caught' - in the meantime they are likely racking up 1-3 karma points every few seconds. Not too shabby!  

Soooooooooooo instead of being bothered by those "easy runs" - stop them - or at least spend a bit of time so it's not a total cakewalk for them! 

So here's the thing to remember about this sub  that I learned in my quest to find out WHY?!?!?! they've been counting day in and out - month after month for years.  Many of them over **10,000** times - a few over **20,000** wow!! 

Everyone is here for their own specific reasons (and set of reasons) and they each must benefit in some way (small? big? dunno) from being here or they wouldn't be here.  

Few if any have the exact same way of counting here and goals and agendas.  

If you don't enjoy a particular type of thread (even one you started) there are dozens of others - and of course the main thread which is one of the main reason many are here. 

Of course - if you can't find a thread that you enjoy or fits your reasons for being here, you can always try and think of a new type of count here that does fit your needs.  So for example - if you'd like to start a type of thread similiar to the "battle thread" - with different rules... that wouldn't "kill the purpose" you could always do that.  I really don't know what those rules would be - something along the lines of ??? um I can't think of something off the top of my head that wouldn't be too 'controlling' of others.  But we can think about it sometime if you'd like.

Till then - just be glad so many have really had a blast because of you and your idea! Including me and likely many others who've watched it as it happens! It's like going to a comedy club for free without having to leave the house! 

(just know those who do those 0-200 easy counts are clearly doing it because they want to / enjoy it / want the sweet karma or a combination of things - be happy you gave them a way to get those needs met!!) 

Besides out of the 7,800+ people over 3 1/2 years - how many can say they thought of a *unique* type of counting here? Not that many! (I've suggested recently that they make a list of all the various threads and who came up with the ideas... so you'll be on that list if it's done!)


So when I was new I posted the following - if you'd like to read up on all my THEORIES as to why people count here - it's pretty funny - here's a link:

https://www.reddit.com/r/counting/comments/35ge26/just_why/


So anyhow before you totally give up on *your baby* you should do at least one of the zen 0-200 straight without getting caught's... you might actually enjoy it? Or at least enjoy helping some other counter who is hoping for an 'easy run'! 


**HUG**

Whitney




Oh - I know - just talking this out with you so you don't think negatively about your stroke-of-genius in creating such a hilarious and insane thread!!! I don't know why they enjoy those 'easy runs' - but I really think perhaps it's a bit of a drug/booze-free adrenelin rush to see if they can get there without being caught! I can see that being the case for some.  (or maybe they are just looking for some handy-dandy-quick-karma!!) I noticed a few of them doubled their karma in a few hours in that thread LOL.

Yup that's me (I tend to be pretty verbose)- understand with rare exception - when I am typing something 'here' - it's for the person who I'm talking to's benefit. But also for others to learn / think about this as well for various other times / situations that it applies too.

I need to do more TL;DR's that's for sure!!

Hope you enjoy those THEORIES!!

**HUG**

You are free to do what *you* want - on your computer but excessive shouting has been considered rude in 99% of circles for decades on the internet.

You are free to continue excessive shouting - and I am free to put you on IGNORE. Since I won't see your messsages - PM me sometime if/when you are done SHOUTING nonstop.

Thanks. Well atom explained to us that it's this subs tradition that in the case of a tie in any stat here - the person who got that # first is #1. 




So this photo is not actually a 'tie' - that's why when he managed to get 43 he was considered back to #1. 

In this picture - you were still #1 even though he'd gotten a k and took second place.  

So anyhow - the rules are the rules - atom has been here forever he knows how that works. I didn't actually know this until that night but it makes a whole lot of sense to me!

So anyhow - I do hope you get a chance to spend more time at #1 here since you've worked so hard for it... really a shame you didn't even get to experience it for a day or two!!  But no matter what you have Xeam's *amazing* picture of you on the throne while you were #1 - and this screenshot as well.








I realize you are busy counting - I just wanted to say it's really good you are on odds - you are one *assist* away from moving from **\#7** - to **\#4** most assists ever in 3 1/2 years of counting here that's a pretty spiffy b-day bonus.

Next assist after that and you are sitting pretty at #3! 


So - *everyone* is on notice - 

snipe pixel's assist on his BDAY and *things are gonna happen... not pretty thing!!**

Well then, Happy Birthday /u/Removedpixel 

(from Too_much_Wiskey) and I 2nd it!!
