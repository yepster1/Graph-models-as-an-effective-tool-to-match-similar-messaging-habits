very clean, good job.What about going with skylake? Also added a higher quality psu. The 3tb seagate has a high faliure rate whikle the 2tb is pretty good. I also swapped the 970 for a 390. 

Had to go for an all black setup to stay under budget.

The site was down for a bit but it's been back up for a while now.Then a beautiful black pc will be the focal point once you walk into the room!

And why not use [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) to stream to a file?This would be the optimal build for 1080p. Go Skylake, it's fairly new and only costs a bit more than haswell. Add a H100i so you can get a nice overclock on the 6600k.

Swapped out the 980 for a 390, the 980 is only ~ 10% better than the 390 but cost $200 more so it isn't worth it.

only problem is that a 750ti isn't enough to run newer games at 1080p. It's fine for cs:go, LoL, Dota etc... but on newer games it's going to get 20-30 fps on med to high settings.

Thanks for the info, I'll probably look into the MX browns. I'd easily pay over $100 for this, Great job!It's pretty much perfect for the size, once it's done, maybe make a slightly larger version for a m-atx and SLI / x-fire?

Let me know when the crowdfunding gets set-up, I'll definitely support this.I wouldn't bundle anything with this case except for the bare necessities. It's not going to be your average builder that buys this case. Most people are going to put some silent Noctua fans in this, so you may as well get the initial costs down by not adding case fans unless you get a deal from a manufacturer for some high quality fans. Did you plug in the extra 8 pin in the mobo?hmm looks good for gaming, but the wrist rest configuration looks like it would be uncomfortable while programming for a few hours. Thanks for the input! I was leaning towards RGB k70.

Do you have the Vengeance or just the regular one?

Edit: Ahh nvm i think the Vengeance just includes the wrist rest, right?

I did a few changes.

* Added a better cpu cooler (H100i GTX)
* Slightly quicker ram
* Cheaper 850 evo
* Cheaper 1tb seagate, is there a special reason why you need the Black WD?
* Better case
* Much higher quality psu.
* Windows 7 is much cheaper and you can upgrade to windows 10 fo free.

That would work for a few years.A z97 board is unnecessary for a locked cpu. I changed the MSI 390 to a Nitro, It runs cooler. Also changed the 750w G2 to the 550w.

The 980 cost way to much for what you get.

Since you already have a 770, you won't see a huge improvement. Maybe save up and get a 980ti.looks good but go for a 280x instead.* Personally i think an i5 would be enough for your needs. I also decided to go with Skylake as it just came out and it's only a bit more than Haswell. 

* Added a good cpu cooler so you can get a nice overclock ([Overclocking guide](http://www.overclock.net/t/1570313/skylake-overclocking-guide-with-statistics)) You should consider overclocking, it's easy and it gives you free performance..

* 16gb ddr4

* Don't get the 840 evo, get the 850 instead. It's better and cheaper.

* With that much music it might be good for you to get a 2tb hdd.

* Added one of the best gpu's on the market for gaming. The 980 isn't worth the price at $500. Either get a 980ti or r9 390.

* Just going to let you know that a full tower is huge, so i just swapped it for a cheaper mid tower.

* You didn't have psu in your build so i added a decent one.

Remember I'm coming from some x12's. :p 


I'd like to keep the keyboard/mouse/headphones/mic under $500. Got any suggestions? Will doA 4460 would make it cheaper but not better.A 380 will be able to play it but a 390 will definitely be able to get 60fps on high to max settings at 1080p.I'm pretty sure there's a mounting point at the bottom of the case for a ssd.Good survey, hope you get some positive results.You're kinda in a tough spot, you could get a 390, 4690k/z97 board for 500 or you could go with a 980ti. 

Only problem is that a 980ti paired with a 8320 isn't exactly ideal but you wont have to buy a new gpu for the next 5 years for 1080p gaming

Decisions, decisions...

You could also switch to Skylake if you get a slightly cheaper 1440p monitor.

Just my opinion though. It should be a great looking build.It's more efficient at pushing air. It still operates at near silent levels at 100%.

This [review](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/beQuiet/Dark_Rock_Pro3/7.html) shows that it's quieter than the Phanteks at all fan speeds.Probably better in /r/buildapcsales.even with a new gpu, your pc won't be able to run those games (because of the cpu).

I think that this would be the best/cheapest upgrade for you.

Overclocking is nice, but it won't give a huge boost in gaming, while a 380 to 390 will. A will max out most games at 1080p. I was still able to add a nice case, you could get a cheaper one to get the overall cost below 1k.

I wouldn't get the hybrids, they don't run much cooler than the ACX's. 16gb ram would be nice, but not necessary.

As for storage, i was considering the 2gb Seagate and 500gb 850 evo, but it's hard to tell what op wants. If it's purely a gaming build, i'd go for a larger ssd with 1tb hdd. If he has movies, music etc.. get a larger hdd. really.. a 980?If it was for a 1080p csgo specific build, you chose probably one of the worst bang/buck gpu's out there. You could get a 390 that performs almost as well for $200 cheaper.

He also says that he wants to play newer/future games on max settings.

 Is a 980ti SLI is overkill for 1080p? Yes.

But it will allow for a future 1440p upgrade if op already doesn't have one.Also gave him a build with more horsepower and a 1080p monitor for the same price.Trust me, this will max out most games at 1080p .

A 4690k and 380 will have a hard time  getting 60fps at max setting on newer games.I don't think the extra pci slot will do much, maybe change it to a b85 and get USB 3.0? But if op doesn't mind the smaller monitor, ips is nice to have. 

I've never tested a transcend ssd, so if reviews are good, why not.

I do like the 620W psu, it does allow for an unlocked chip/mobo upgrade in the future while not sacrificing on quality.Good catch, forgot that some people are still using systems with ddr2 lmao.no, just get one 980ti and a 5820k with a x99 motherboard. Then save a bit more to add another 980ti later.Overpriced unless you plan to do a 4 way SLI.Good build, don't forget to get a cpu cooler. You can get a hyper 212 evo for cheap.Yes, you'll be fine lol, just don't overclock on it.Fps wise, not that much. 8GB is preferred for gaming but the 260x is what is most likely holding you back.As much as we like to shit on amd cpu's for gaming, a 4160 isn't better than 9590, better than 8320 in some games, yes but not a 9590.I don't know where you're getting these prices but if you get the parts from different retailers, you can do for cheaper. I also changed some parts. 

I swapped the board for one that accepts ddr4 ram. Don't get a v300, it's one of the worst ssd's out there. Changed the 970 for a better 390. Also added a much better psu.

Take a look at the s340. Changed the psu for a much higher quality GS.

If it's 2013, you can't because of Microsoft click and run bs. 

You might be able to do through the registry but I'm not going to tell you to poke around in it, maybe someone else with some experience knows what to do.

Good luck.When it comes to motherboards, all that counts is features. They don't provide any gaming or modeling 'boosts'. 

A b85 board doesn't support x-fire, or any type of raid configuration, only has 4 sata 6gb's etc... The only reason i would get a b85 over a b81 is if you wanted usb 3.0. 

The h97 that i put in this build doesn't support x-fire (most h97's do) but it does have quite a bit more features than the b85. The board in my build is also cheaper than the older b85 that op chose.Are you overclocking? because that wouldn't be a good thing to do with a stock fan. You might be getting throttled.Like everyone else is saying, you'll need a new system. You can do it for ~ $375 for a G3258/750ti build that's respectable at 1080p, depending on the game.ok, have you tried to set the 970 back to stock and see how it runs?hmm that's weird... any new (beta) driver downloads?Adding to the counter arguments:

* [tom's thread](http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2766987/370-7950.html)

* [UserBenchmark](http://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-R7-370-vs-AMD-HD-7950/m30480vs2160)

* [Overclock.net](http://www.overclock.net/t/502403/graphics-card-ranking)

* [Hardware compare](http://www.hwcompare.com/19611/radeon-hd-7950-vs-radeon-r7-370-4g/)

Try to throw as much as shit at them as you can then demand a better card (280x, 290) for their screw up.

Don't get a 980, it's terribly overpriced, go for a 980ti. You can get a h100i or kraken x61 for ~ $110. You can get a free upgrade to windows 10 as long as you aren't on Vista.. please tell me you aren't on Vista..

Don't worry about bottlenecking a 980ti though, a overclocked 2600k is still very capable.Please stop this madness. It's been [discussed a thousand times](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/search?q=970+vs+390&amp;restrict_sr=on).&gt;Have you read the sidebar and rules? (Please do)
&gt;yes i have

no.

/r/buildapcforme currently have a 970, waiting for the whole dx12 fiasco to sort its self out before i upgrade.same in Canada:/[Windows 7 to 10](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/windows-10-upgrade)

If that doesn't work use, the [media creation tool](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install).Depends on the game. A overclocked g3258/750ti will max out 1080p 60fps on csgo, LoL, Dota etc.. but it'll have a hard time getting 60fps on med. settings on newer games like metal gear solid 5, GTA 5, fallout 4 etc..It's hyper threaded like the i7 but it's locked and it doesn't have an integrated gpu.Well you can kinda change the base clock, you won't get a lot of performance and it's not recommended. The multiplier is locked though.Get a 850w G2 if you wan to SLI.You could go with a Skylake i5 6600k/z170/ddr4 which would cost ~ $425.

You could go with a haswell i5 4690k/z97 which would cost ~ $340.

And if you don't care about overclocking, get a 4460/h97 for ~ $160.

Something like this would be a good budget build.

Let's say you choose something like a 4460/280x, a overclocked 6300/390 would give you better gaming performance. Just something to think about.wow, they're a lot closer in performance than i thought. Would still go with a 390 though :PI actually have a 970 Strix and it's great, i was planning on upgrading to a 980ti but may as well for the whole dx12 thing works itself out before i upgrade. Never know, AMD might take over the high end market as well.  Normally i would agree, but if you plan to go with a SLI/x-fire setup, I'd more comfortable with 8gb Vram instead of 3.5gb. Unless dx12 and Devs. will be able to utilize Vram stacking.  The difference between a 770 and a 390/970 isn't huge and a 980 is a waste of money. I'd save a bit more and get a 980ti. Why not get a cheaper 1440p 27" ips monitor and get a 980ti?

If you have the money, you may as well go skylake, but it's not necessary.

Personally i would just go with a 650w EVGA G2, but if you want a near silent psu, look at the AX760i by Corsair.A 980ti with that monitor would be quite a waste. I'll give you a couple different options:

This would be the ideal high end gaming / music production pc.

Went with an i7 Skylake because it's few yes newer and a it's only  bit more. It overclocks easily to 4.6 - 4.7ghz with a H100i. 16gb ddr4 ram. In your build you didn't add a ssd, do you already have one? I went with a smaller mid tower, don't get a full tower unless you absolutely need it. Changed the monitor to a nice 27" 1440p ips.

This one has a Skylake i5. Since it's mainly a gaming rig, i don't think the extra $100 is worth it for you. Also added a good liquid cooler so you can get a nice overclock.

In your $1700 build you don't have a ssd, so do you already have one? Swapped the 980ti for a 390. If you plan on staying at 1080p, a 980ti is a waste. I added a high quality 650w and a ips monitor.

You avoid the SLI compatibility problems and a overclocked 980ti usually outperforms a 970 SLI.I'd still go with a 4170/b81 for a budget build. You won't see a noticeable performance gain from a 4170 --&gt; 6100.Definitely not as appealing to the eye, but you'll get a nice gpu instead of a budget video card.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-09 08:03 EDT-0400 |Here are some changes to consider. I went with a cheaper case and cheaper psu to add a 250gb ssd and a better wifi adapter. An EVGA G2 is a great psu but at 750w's, it's in an odd spot. 750w is alot for a single gpu (600-650w preferred) and not enough for a x-fire (at least 850w). If you can find a 650 G2 on amazon for ~ \u20ac90, go for that.

Changed the cpu to a 6 core 5820k, it overclocks really well. I went for an all black theme, that's why i went with the dark rock pro and all black mobo.

Since you'll doing a lot of VM work, i put in 32gb ram. 

Decided to go with a 250gb ssd / 1tb hdd setup (My preference). 

Went with a much better 980ti.

Great psu.

The biggest change in this build is probably the monitor. IMO 4k for gaming isn't really ideal because there are not 144hz monitors and you basically need 2-3 980ti's to be able to play games at max settings.

1440p on the other hand is a great resolution, especially for a 980ti. The monitor i chose is a very nice 27" 144hz G-sync.

I'd change the hdd to a better quality 2tb Seagate.

If you go with a 390, use that money saved to get a h100i or kraken x61.

Since you're working with audio, it might be worth it to invest in a nice sound card.yup, good catch.* Step 1: Get a 390 Nitro
 
* Step 2: Overclock said Nitro

* Step 3: Observe the 390 performing similar to a 390xThe card is already 12.1" long, I wouldn't get the one with the back plate unless you have someway to stop it from ~~drooping~~ sagging. Quad core / 8 thread with 16gb ram. I think this would work best for you. I wasn't able to find a price for the 850 evo but it should be around \u20ac100.

Depending on the games you play, a 390 won't hit 144fps in newer games so you're going to need to upgrade to a x-fire or get a new gpu. You motherboard does support x-fire. A better one would be nice, but not necessary. You will need to upgrade to a 750-850w psu for a x-fire though. (Go with a 850w if you intend to upgrade to an unlocked chip). Elections in 10 days :)390/970 's will be trash by the time proper dx12 games are released.

Edit: Trash might be a strong word but they'll have their replacements. ahh ok, that makes sense.I doubt very many people have a H170/B150/locked skylake cpu yet, but we could help you out anyways. What are your questions?5820k --&gt; 6 cores / 12 threads --&gt; overclocks to ~ 4.2-4.5ghz.

6700k --&gt; 4 cores / 8 threads --&gt; overclocks to ~ 4.6- 4.8ghz.Pretty much the same size as the cd player in my car lol.

Well done!well... Lego is like the Mega Blocks to pc parts.You don't need anything crazy for dota, I can make you a $400 pc that can play it on ultra at 1080 lol.Anything but conservative lol.You could make this cheaper by swapping out the ssd for a hdd.

I upgraded from 8 to 8.1 then 10 within a day.I think i need a windows 8 iso because the laptop originally had 8. :/Awesome! I'll keep you posed to see if it worked. Thank youIt worked! Thank you.Should be good for csgo, LoL, Dota2 etc..You can usually get a 4 - 4.2ghz overclock on a 4690k with a 212 evo. It's a pretty solid air cooler.If you're on a bit of a budget, a s340 is pretty good.S340, sexy in a classy kind of way while being friendly on the wallet.Made a few changes:

* Cheaper but equivalent board (White/black theme)
* Better Cpu cooler
* Better hdd, Don't get a green WD.
* Swapped the 970 for a 390, it's better.
* Better quality white case
* Added a good quality psu.


Overall a bit cheaper than your build. You should drive to Germany or something because some of those parts are very expensive and you don't have a huge selection.

Budget build, budget parts.That's a good point, it's still way over budget since op still needs os's :/I know lol, it would be wiser to drop 5k on 10 good pc's if you plan on opening a shop.Not again...2400mhz is a lot more important than dual channel especially when there's only room for 2 dimm's on the board and you go for 2x2gb ram. 1x4gb Kingston Savage ram is going to cost op an extra $20 overall ($4 x 5) or you could even go for some 2x4gb 2400mhz G.Skill Ripjaws X Series for extra $70 overall ($14 x 5).wouldn't that be nice...oh you'll hit 60fps... on lowest settings and lowest possible resolution.wow lol! I'm redoing my build!ahh ok that makes more sense... 1 question, are you making this in your basement for your friends or do you have an actual shop that you plan on making money with this??water cooling is the worst for longevity lol, stick with air cooling.meh not a huge fan of the 144hz price tag if you're not a pro cs/moba player.I don't take to kindly to suggestions.To be perfectly honest with you, If you plan on making money I'd build 10 $500 machines instead of 5 $1000 machines. The most popular games like CS:GO, League of Legends and Dota 2 are all 5 vs.5 games. Your Shop is going to be much more appealing to groups of kids on a Friday night or Birthday parties if they can all play against each other. I'm guessing you're going to charge something like $5/hour? If you can get a couple full groups on Friday/Saturday doing 4 hour sessions, you're going to pay off these systems pretty quick. 

And these will max out the games i listed above at 1080p. They even play newer games at med-high settings.

Just my 2 cents.

If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?

&gt;   USA Indiana. No!

You're looking at ~ $530 before mail-ins if you can swing it ($485 after).

You'll easily max out cs and LoL at 1080p, You'll get playable frames (30-40) on newer AAA games at 1080p on mid-high settings (Depending on the game).

Couple questions:

* Do you want to overclock?

* What type of build is this? (gaming, editing, both etc...)

Good build, swap out the monitor though, you don't want to play cs with 25 ms lol.Yup that's what i would do, hard to say if OP needs an os lol

&gt; What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)

&gt; Tower/Windows 10/ Monitor



&gt;  Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?

&gt; No

oh it's the end of the world alright...ahh good call, i always find those amazon sellers sketchy though...This is what you're looking at to get a decent gaming/streaming pc. As /u/dickeschl4mpe said, it's not possible to do it for $900

Part that I used:

* I went with the new Skylake chip that got released this summer. Why would you get older parts if you can afford to go new? It's also unlocked, I know you said you don't want to overclock but you should. It's supper safe nowadays and it pushes out extra performance.

* solid cpu cooler.

* Good motherboard that can SLI w/ white/black theme

* 8gb ddr4 ram. That's all you need for a gaming build and once you need 16gb, all you need to do is add another 2x8gb kit.

* Solid ssd/hdd combo. (Make sure you put your OS on the ssd)

* Don't get a 980, it's a terrible card once you consider bang/buck. A 980ti on the other hand is very solid. It's able to run most games at 1440p at 60fps on high. Plus with this motherboard, if you're planning on going to 4k or 1440p/144hz, you have room to add another 980ti and run them in SLI.

* Nice good quality case that;'s friendly on the wallet.

* Added one of the highest quality psu's on the market. I went with 850w's because if you plan on adding another gpu further down the road you won't have to buy another psu.

* Windows 10

* Very good wifi adapter. Try to game on a wired connection if at all possible.

Good luck!

Parts I used:

* New Skylake chip that came out this summer.

* Good cpu cooler that will get a good overclock on the 6600k

* Good motherboard that can SLI

* 16gb of ddr4. You only 8gb for a gaming build but since it's a high end build, you may as well have 16.

* Solid ssd/hdd combo.

* 980ti SLI... that's all i have to say about that.

* Very high quality psu that won't blow up your system.

* Solid high quality sound proofed case.

* windows 10

* I was looking at the widescreens but IMO i find that they're a bit overpriced so i went with a 27" IPS 1440p monitor.

* Good mechanical keyboard and optical mouse.

Solidworks recommends an i7 and i was trying to fit a hyperthreaded xeon from micro center but it would cost you another $40 (You should consider it).


If you can invest another $100, this build could be quite a bit better.


Parts: 

* 4590, respectable cpu at a cheap price from Micro center (You should get the Xeon that's on sale at Micro center for 209.99).

* Budget h81 board.

* 1x8gb ram, room for another stick.

* 1tb hdd

* Went with a 4gb 960 that's on sale. (Cuda cores for cad).

* Cheap case and psu

* Windows 8.1 (you can upgrade to windows 10 for free)

* Cheap ips monitor with a decent kb/mouse combo.

Parts:

* solid 6600k

* Very quiet air cooler that can handle overclocking

* Good quality Mini-Itx board with AC wifi 

* 16gb ddr4

* Solid case, similar style to the Lian Li's that you were referring to in your post.

* Very high quality psu.

What software do you plan on using for your dev. work?For sure, if you don't mind spending the extra $$$ it wouldn't be a bad idea.The 1tb and 2tb are fine, it's the 3tb you have to watch out for.If you plan on upgrading to 1440p in the future then a 980ti is fine.

The only 'flaw' i see is that the 750w G2 isn't strong enough for a SLI setup and it's overkill for your current setup. I know that the 750w is currently cheaper than the 650w, but if you're planning to SLI at a latter date, get the 850w.I'd go for a 390 over a 970 bit in any case either of should be to get 60fps at 1080p high-max settings.I wouldn't mind going that route but it's hard to find used g3258's around here.Here's a pretty solid build, since you won't be overclocking i went with a Xeon. Arcmap uses multi-threading so this cpu would be great for you. I also put in a 390, it'll run nearly every game maxed out 60 fps (1080p). When you start installing Windows, it'll ask you to chose a language.

The only difference is that you can't overclock it and it doesn't come with integrated graphic (which doesn't matter because you have a dedicated gpu in your system).

I don't think 16gb ram is necessary, as Arcmap only requires 2gb to run so unless you want to run it and play  games at the same time 8gb will be fine. But if you don't mind spending a bit more, it wouldn't be a bad upgrade.OP is probably going to have to get a custom case if he wants it to be under 7" wide. You're going to have to sacrifice a lot pc horsepower to afford an ultra-wide personally i would go with a 1080p ips monitor, hyper-threaded Xeon, 16gb ram and a 390.

See if you can find these parts locally.

So in reality you're looking for a case that's  19" L, 6"W, 11.5"H.you would have to drop the cpu down to a i5 4460. You're going to have a hard time breaking 60 fps on newer games with a 390 at 1440p.

And by ultra-wide I though you meant 3440 x 1440 lolNope, it does that pretty easily.Yup you could drop down to 8gb, just don't run Photoshop and game at the same time lolPersonally for that amount of $$ I'd go for something like this, it'll perform a lotttt better.

Parts:

* Cpu- Go for an i5 6600k, an i7 will do absolutely nothing in 99.9% of games.

* Cpu cooler - You chose a solid air cooler.

* Motherboard -  Decent motherboard with a good amount of features.

* Ram - You only need 8gb in a gaming build, plus this board has room for another 2x4gb kitif you every need it.

* Storage - Good ssd/hdd combo.

* Gpu - Don't get a 980, it's a terrible gpu once you consider bang/buck (Not actually saying it's bad). Get a 980ti, you'll be much happier.

* case - I left the case. It's a good budget that has decent cable managment.

* Psu - Good quality power supply. Get an 850w if you plan to SLI.

* Os - Get the cheapest version of windows available (7, 8.1 or 10). You can upgrade for free.

Parts:

* I went with the new Skylake i5 cpu, It's unlocked so that means it can be overclocked. There are a ton of good guides on YouTube that explain what it is and how to do it properly.

* The cpu cooler that I put in this build is probably the best air cooler on the market. It's extremely quite while being able to control the temps of an overclocked cpu.

* A good motherboard that has quite a few features... but the main one is being able to SLI (use multiple graphics cards)

* I went for 8gb ram, that's all you need in a gaming pc, but soon 16gb will be recommend. So if you don't mind spending a bit more, adding adding another 8 definitely wouldn't be a bad idea.

* Storage wise you're set. I put in a solid ssd/hdd combo.

* The best part of the build is the 980ti. One of the best gpu's on the market. 

* I added an overkill power supply, but it gives you the option to add another 980ti down the road.

* Solid case that has some good sound proofing.

* Windows 7, Coming from a Java/Android dev and gamer i actually like win10, you should give it a try.

* I also added a very good mechanical keyboard, if you want to be extra fancy, you can get the k70 RGB for an extra $50.

So no, in any price range, there's always an Intel chip that will be the better alternative.Did you see his/her build? It's pretty much the exact same price. I was showing him/her that there was a better alternative at that price range.Good Luck!You have the budget to make a monster build while also being able to future proof at the same time.

Part that I used:

* I went with the new Skylake chip that got released this summer. Why would you get older parts if you can afford to go new? It's also unlocked, I know you said you don't want to overclock but you should. It's supper safe nowadays and it pushes out extra performance.

* solid cpu cooler.

* Good motherboard that can SLI w/ white/black theme

* 8gb ddr4 ram. That's all you need for a gaming build and once you need 16gb, all you need to do is add another 2x8gb kit.

* Solid ssd/hdd combo. (Make sure you put your OS on the ssd)

* Don't get a 980, it's a terrible card once you consider bang/buck. A 980ti on the other hand is very solid. It's able to run most games at 1440p at 60fps on high. Plus with this motherboard, if you're planning on going to 4k or 1440p/144hz, you have room to add another 980ti and run them in SLI.

* Nice good quality case that;'s friendly on the wallet.

* Added one of the highest quality psu's on the market. I went with 850w's because if you plan on adding another gpu further down the road you won't have to buy another psu.

* Windows 10

* Very good wifi adapter. Try to game on a wired connection if at all possible.

Good luck!

Parts I used:

* New Skylake chip that came out this summer.

* Good cpu cooler that will get a good overclock on the 6600k

* Good motherboard that can SLI

* 16gb of ddr4. You only 8gb for a gaming build but since it's a high end build, you may as well have 16.

* Solid ssd/hdd combo.

* 980ti SLI... that's all i have to say about that.

* Very high quality psu that won't blow up your system.

* Solid high quality sound proofed case.

* windows 10

* I was looking at the widescreens but IMO i find that they're a bit overpriced so i went with a 27" IPS 1440p monitor.

* Good mechanical keyboard and optical mouse.

Good Luck!

Solidworks recommends an i7 and i was trying to fit a hyperthreaded xeon from micro center but it would cost you another $40 (You should consider it).


If you can invest another $100, this build could be quite a bit better.


Parts: 

* 4590, respectable cpu at a cheap price from Micro center (You should get the Xeon that's on sale at Micro center for 209.99).

* Budget h81 board.

* 1x8gb ram, room for another stick.

* 1tb hdd

* Went with a 4gb 960 that's on sale. (Cuda cores for cad).

* Cheap case and psu

* Windows 8.1 (you can upgrade to windows 10 for free)

* Cheap ips monitor with a decent kb/mouse combo.

Parts:

* solid 6600k

* Very quiet air cooler that can handle overclocking

* Good quality Mini-Itx board with AC wifi 

* 16gb ddr4

* Solid case, similar style to the Lian Li's that you were referring to in your post.

* Very high quality psu.

What software do you plan on using for your dev. work?For sure, if you don't mind spending the extra $$$ it wouldn't be a bad idea.The 1tb and 2tb are fine, it's the 3tb you have to watch out for.If you plan on upgrading to 1440p in the future then a 980ti is fine.

The only 'flaw' i see is that the 750w G2 isn't strong enough for a SLI setup and it's overkill for your current setup. I know that the 750w is currently cheaper than the 650w, but if you're planning to SLI at a latter date, get the 850w.I'd go for a 390 over a 970 bit in any case either of should be to get 60fps at 1080p high-max settings.I wouldn't mind going that route but it's hard to find used g3258's around here.Here's a pretty solid build, since you won't be overclocking i went with a Xeon. Arcmap uses multi-threading so this cpu would be great for you. I also put in a 390, it'll run nearly every game maxed out 60 fps (1080p). When you start installing Windows, it'll ask you to chose a language.

The only difference is that you can't overclock it and it doesn't come with integrated graphic (which doesn't matter because you have a dedicated gpu in your system).

I don't think 16gb ram is necessary, as Arcmap only requires 2gb to run so unless you want to run it and play  games at the same time 8gb will be fine. But if you don't mind spending a bit more, it wouldn't be a bad upgrade.OP is probably going to have to get a custom case if he wants it to be under 7" wide. You're going to have to sacrifice a lot pc horsepower to afford an ultra-wide personally i would go with a 1080p ips monitor, hyper-threaded Xeon, 16gb ram and a 390.

See if you can find these parts locally.

So in reality you're looking for a case that's  19" L, 6"W, 11.5"H.you would have to drop the cpu down to a i5 4460. You're going to have a hard time breaking 60 fps on newer games with a 390 at 1440p.

And by ultra-wide I though you meant 3440 x 1440 lolNope, it does that pretty easily.Yup you could drop down to 8gb, just don't run Photoshop and game at the same time lolPersonally for that amount of $$ I'd go for something like this, it'll perform a lotttt better.

Parts:

* Cpu- Go for an i5 6600k, an i7 will do absolutely nothing in 99.9% of games.

* Cpu cooler - You chose a solid air cooler.

* Motherboard -  Decent motherboard with a good amount of features.

* Ram - You only need 8gb in a gaming build, plus this board has room for another 2x4gb kitif you every need it.

* Storage - Good ssd/hdd combo.

* Gpu - Don't get a 980, it's a terrible gpu once you consider bang/buck (Not actually saying it's bad). Get a 980ti, you'll be much happier.

* case - I left the case. It's a good budget that has decent cable managment.

* Psu - Good quality power supply. Get an 850w if you plan to SLI.

* Os - Get the cheapest version of windows available (7, 8.1 or 10). You can upgrade for free.

Parts:

* I went with the new Skylake i5 cpu, It's unlocked so that means it can be overclocked. There are a ton of good guides on YouTube that explain what it is and how to do it properly.

* The cpu cooler that I put in this build is probably the best air cooler on the market. It's extremely quite while being able to control the temps of an overclocked cpu.

* A good motherboard that has quite a few features... but the main one is being able to SLI (use multiple graphics cards)

* I went for 8gb ram, that's all you need in a gaming pc, but soon 16gb will be recommend. So if you don't mind spending a bit more, adding adding another 8 definitely wouldn't be a bad idea.

* Storage wise you're set. I put in a solid ssd/hdd combo.

* The best part of the build is the 980ti. One of the best gpu's on the market. 

* I added an overkill power supply, but it gives you the option to add another 980ti down the road.

* Solid case that has some good sound proofing.

* Windows 7, Coming from a Java/Android dev and gamer i actually like win10, you should give it a try.

* I also added a very good mechanical keyboard, if you want to be extra fancy, you can get the k70 RGB for an extra $50.

So no, in any price range, there's always an Intel chip that will be the better alternative.Did you see his/her build? It's pretty much the exact same price. I was showing him/her that there was a better alternative at that price range.Good Luck!It really depends on how you define 'decent'. I wouldn't worry about getting specific parts for Sketchup though, I took a look at the requirements and it look like it can run on a potato.

This build here here would get 40-60 fps on high settings (1080p) in newer games, but you would probably be needing an upgrade within two years.

This next build is considered to be a good gaming pc that would last about 3-4 years without upgrades and have luxuries like an unlocked cpu, a ssd and 16gb ram. It'll max out nearly every game at 1080 60+ fps and do pretty well at 1440p.

Yeah the gpu would need an upgrade and you might need 16gb ram by then.Something like this would be nice. I wouldn't worry about replacing your 280x just yet. It's still got a couple good year left at 1080p. The psu i put in the build is overkill but it's super high quality and there's a crazy deal going on if you don't mind mail-ins.

(1080p of course).You won't be able make a build under 2k for 1440p/144hz unless you go really cheap. And if you go that route a single 980ti isn't enough to reach 144fps in newer games at 1440p.

That would be silly.Np, the build below would definitely perform better than mine, but since you already have 280x I'd wait for the whole dx-12 thing to sort itself out before buying a new gpu.No definitely not from a bottlenecking perspective, but from a 1440/144hz build perspective.. Something like this would work well for you.

A 680ti is getting really dated and depending if it's the 2gb or 4gb version, you're going to have a hard time running games at acceptable settings with a $650+ monitor.

If you can afford an ips g-sync definitely go for it, but the ROG is still one hell of a monitor.
haha sorry... it's Wednesday... Here's an updated version.

Depending if you drive a prius or F350, it may be worth it for you to get a G3258 from microcenter for $50. I'll edit the post once pcpp is back up.Yup good ole raid 1. Linux has some free software that can do this. I'm not 100% sure about the tv tuner, their might be a way to get around that.If i were in your shoes I'd build a decent 1080p machine /i3 4170/280x or something similar for around $600. And wait for the whole dx 12 thing to sort itself out, then buy a beast machine. I'm with you, I'm 100% sold on AMD and freesync being the way of the future... but you have to give them props about the 390 though, that thing is pretty sick.

...anyways that's my 2 cents lolClearly you've never went out an bought an i5 2380P or something similar for a media center / plex build lolYou'll get a much better experience with this type of build. The AMD apu's are alright but they can't touch a 750ti.

There's no need for a cd drive, you can install windows from a usb and always try to game on a wired connection if at all possible.

Shit.. ok try to get a good quality wifi adapter.

&gt;Is there anyreason to spend the extra $10 upfront for windows 10 rather than buying windows 7 and then upgrading?

Nope. Just get the cheapest one and upgrade to 10 for free, although it's hard finding a .iso for windows 7 (to put it on a usb). 

&gt;If I want to install Windows from a usb... does that usb come in the retail box?

If you have a usb (8gb preferably) already you can go to [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and create your own bootable usb very easily (windows 10 and 8.1 only).pretty close in terms of performance but the 750ti has half the TDP (amount of power it uses).Technically, it'll have very little impact if op decides to go with a 4460 lolYes, you still have to pay for it to get the key. It's just an alternative if you don't have a cd drive. Personally i think this would be the optimal build for you guys, it's a bit over budget but if your donor is flexible it might be ok. I wasn't sure what kind of storage you guys needed so i just put in a small ssd for the OS and a 1tb hdd for everything else.

The xeon chip in this build has to be purchased from Microcenter otherwise it'll be a lot more expensive. I also went with a gtx 970 since you guys are looking to utilize cuda cores. The psu in this build i wayyy overkill but it's extremely good quality and there's a pretty crazy deal going on.

Unfortunately it's 3x the price of a 970 :/There's a $25 mail in on the 650w G2 making it $59.99. It's a much better psu, besides that this is a pretty solid build.No but this is one of the highest quality psu's on the market and it's cheaper than some of the budget power supplies.He could probably get away with a 4gb 960/380 but I imagine that a 390 will work out great for something like fallout 4 plus it's within his budget so he may as well.No definitely not, you would only see a marginal increase in fps with an i7. If you want to upgrade, get an i5 4690k / z97 board or an i5 6600k / Z170 board / ddr4 ram.Yeah I agree, I'd probably go with a 280x in that price range.I blew up a system with a 600b so I always try to get the best possible psu.I'm not sold on dx 12 yet :p 

By next summer it might a bit clearer.Cheap 8 core cpu with an NVidia gpu to take advantage of some Cuda cores.

It took my 770 with it lolHow do you figure? At max load this system isn't going to pull over 300W. Even if OP wants to overclock the 8320 he'll still be fine. I know it's not a G2 or anything but the CX is perfectly fine for this type of build. Whats wrong with the board? Sure it's a budget board, but it has usb 3.0, it can overclock and it can house 32gb ram.* This isn't a gaming build, the 4460 will be outperformed by 8320 at stock speed in multi-threaded applications never mind an overclocked 8320.

* I don't know if i would call the Hyper tx3 quiet. As soon as the fan get over 60% load, it sounds like a leaf blower. The stock fan on the 4460 is perfectly adequate.

* 3tb Seagate hdd? Those have some of the highest failure rates of any hdd's on the market.

* You were complaining about my power supply but the one chose is still on the lower end (quality wise) and it's not modular in any way which is going to restrict airflow, especially in a cheap case.
This is probably the best i can do in that price range but you won't have a problem running any MMO like WoW, Tera etc..

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-05 13:28 GMT+0000 |I've been reading this whole back and forth with you and /u/Welshy123. He's right about the V300. It's nowhere near the performance of an 850. Putting a 212 Evo on locked cpu should be purely for aesthetics especially if your build is already over budget. The stock fan will do fine.

 By saying mmo's are cpu intensive just means that you'll get a significant fps boost by going with a 4460 over something like 8350. It's doesn't mean that the cpu is going to be running at 100% all the time during the game.

But you both missed that OP wants an OS included in his build, so it's going to significantly alter the build. Take a look at mine and see if you can improve it.You should easily get 40-60 fps on high setting at 1080p.Good sugestions, i'd definitely trade usb 3.0 for an extra 2gb Vram. I thought that was the TS. (I though to myself that it was to good to be True XD)With $1500, there are ton of configurations you could go with.If it's your first build and aren't comfortable with overclocking (It's perfectly safe nowadays) you could go with something like this.

Parts:

* Cpu - An i5 4460 is great locked (can't overclock it) cpu.

* Motherboard - h97 board to match the cpu, it has a good amount of features.

* 8gb ram. That's all you need in a gaming build. If you have extra cash leaf over after everything else you may as well upgrade to 16. We might need 16gb for gaming in a couple years.

* Great ssd/hdd combo. Make sure to always install the OS on the ssd.

* A 980ti, it's overkill for 1080/60hz but great for 1440p or 1080/144hz (That's what i have in this build).

* Good quality case with a window.

* When you have a 980ti in your build, you never want to risk putting in a cheap power supply like a corsair cx. Get a Evga G2, it's one of the highest quality psu's on the market.

* Windows 10. I've been using it for a few months and i like it :P

* 1080p / 144hz monitor. Awesome monitor for fps games. If you can afford a bit more, get a 27" 1440p. Games will look amazing on it

* You don't need a cpu cooler on a locked cpu. The stock one will work fine.

* Is there a specific reason why you need a h97 motherboard? You can get a cheaper h81 or b85.

* A 380 usually outperform a 960. Try to one with 4gb Vram, because 2gb is going to be cutting it close at 1080 with new games at high settings.

* Never cheap out on the power supply, always try to get the best quality that your budget allows for.

* At that price, you can afford a much better IPS 1080p monitor.

If you can, go for something like this.

Edit Anandtech was a mistake. (980 sli not 980ti sli)What's the reason for staying away from Xeon's? This is the type of suff their built for. 

Parts:

 * Cpu - I'd go with a Xeon, but if you really have a vendetta against it, get an i7 4790.

* Board - Decent board with a good amount of features.

* Ram - 2x8gb ddr3 ram. Room for another 2x8gb kit if you need it.

* Storage - As requested, went with a 500gb ssd / 1tb hdd.

* Gpu - Went with an NVidia GTX 960 for the Cuda cores.

* Case - Since it's going under your desk, this is a simple good quality case.

* Psu - Solid power supply that you won't have to worry about when your system is under heavy load.

* Os - You can upgrade to windows 10 for free with what you already have.

Just saying you buy an all out system then you have to turn down settings to hit 60 fps.hmm.. and this is coming from someone who doesn't recommend 1080p anymore.This would be a good starter build. I made it a red/black theme (You could save around $80 if you lose the color matching).

* Cpu - brand new 6600k that came out this summer. It can be overclocked. (Overclocking is very safe to do now, you really have to try to damaged your parts. Just do your research before you start playing with voltages).

* cpu cooler - awesome all black cooler that's very quiet and performs very well.

* Motherboard - Feature rich red/black motherboard.

* Ram - 2x4gb ddr4 red ram. You may want to jump to a 2x8gb kit, we might need it for gaming in the next couple years.

* Storage - Solid ssd/hdd combo. (Don't get the 3tb seagate, it has a high faliure rate).

* Gpu - Very good 1080p gpu that stays cool.

* Case - good quality case with a big side window

* psu - very high quality power supply .

* Os - I like Windows 10 but get whatever you're comfortable with.

* monitor - very nice ips 1080 monitor.

I went for a pretty cool red/black setup. All the parts in this build are very high quality and should last quite a while.

* changed the board to one that's easier on the eyes..

* 1x8gb ram, makes it cheaper to upgrade to 16gb if needed,

* 380 out performs a 960

* much higher quality psu


Overall it's a bit better and cheaper.

I figured it would probably cost around 100 to ship everything. Johnny guru also gave the Corsair cx a 9...Good luck lol good luckThis would be a solid build for 1080p, you have to get the cpu and board at Microcenter, they come as a bundle. I'm going with a nice red/black theme build.

Parts:

* cpu - 6600k. brand new chip that just released this summer. It's unlocked so it can be overclock in the future if you need to / want to.

* motherboard - Nice looking board with a good amount of features. (Comes with the cpu as a bundle from Microcenter)

* Cpu cooler - Very quiet cpu cooler that keeps overclocked cpu's very cool.

* Ram - 16gb ddr4 ram, 16gb is a little overkill, but you can afford it.

* Storage - Solid ssd/hdd combo.

* Gpu - Great gpu for 1080p that will easily drive 2 monitors.

* Case - very high quality case that has some pretty sound proofing.

* Psu - One of the highest quality power supply's on the market.

* Wifi adapter - Great AC wifi adapter.

Parts i used:

* Cpu - Since you aren't overclocking i went with a locked Xeon, It's very simiar to an i7 4790.

* Motherboard - I had to go with a z97 because h97's don't have any boards with more than 6 sata ports, this one has 8 :)

* Ram - Basic 16gb ddr3, room for another 2x8gb kit.

* Storage - Very fast 400gb pci sdd, and two 2tb hdd's. Why raid 0? wouldn't raid 1 make more sense?

* Gpu - R9 390, capable of playing almost every game maxed out 60 fps (1080p)

* Case - high quality full tower with lots of room.

* Psu - very good quality psu so you don't have to worry about your system in high load situations.

* Os - Windows 10 pro.

See if you can get these part where you are at a reasonable price.

Also get a cheap b85/h81 motherboard that has USB 3.0 headers and 8gb ddr3 ram instead of 16gb ddr4 ram. Just that alone sould get you close to under 1k. Good luck.Sorry for maxing out your budget... i couldn't resist lol. 

Parts:

* I put in an i7 Skylake chip. IMO it's the happy medium between a 5820k and 4690k. It'll be solid for a gaming/streaming build.

* The board has a good amount of features. (Going for a red/black theme).

* The cpu cooler is very quiet while very capable at cooling overclocked cpu's.

* I went with a 500gb ssd because it's very frustrating to be sitting in loading screens while streaming, so you can put your os and a few games on it. There's also a 1tb hdd for some more storage.

* It doesn't get much better than a 980ti SLI.

* Very high quality psu and case.

* The monitor isn't as all out as /u/sergeantminor 's 165hz ips monster but it's still an amazing monitor.

Here's a Skylake build with a second monitor (Same one as yours, so it matches). I have the 970 strix that's in this build and i love it, but you would probably be better off getting a 390 for heavily modded games.

Parts:

* Brand new cpu that came out this summer. It's unlocked which will make last a bit longer than it's locked counterparts (You can avoid bottlenecking gpu's 5 years down the road)

* All black cpu cooler that's very quiet and proficient.

* All black mobo with a good amount of features. I'm not a 100% on Evga and their motherboards so make sure to do a bit more research on it before you buy.

* All black g.skill ddr4 ram. 3200mhz is overkill for gaming but it's a good looking kit.

* Solid storage, 250gb ssd / 1tb hdd.

* Doesn't get much better than a 980ti.

* Very high quality psu and case.

* 1080p still has it's merits, but with this kind of budget, definitely go with 1440p.

I'd like to be the first one to welcome to the dark side! (pc master race :p).
 This would be a very solid 1080p gaming rig. If you don't want to partition your drives, you and your wife can each have your own 250gb ssd and 1tb hdd. You would have to get the cpu and motherboard at Micro center, they come as a bundle.

Edit: spelling.

It's pretty much the same thing as an i7 4790 minus the integrated graphics. You can get a hell of a deal on it right now, but you have to get it in-store at microcenter. (209.99).

Parts:

* Cpu - Hyperthreaded Xeon, great for data analysis software.

* Motherboard - Basic H81 motherboard with usb 3.0 headers.

* Ram - 16gb ram, good for your analysis software.

* Storage - Solid 250gb ssd / 1tb hdd combo.

* Gpu - Awesome gpu that will easily hit 144fps on the games you listed at max/near-max settings.

* Case - Good quality case that has some good cable management.

* Power supply - One of the best psu's currently on the market.

* Os - Windows 10, I've been using it for a few months and i like it.

I get that it'll work, but I'm not a fan of it :/ 

But i guess in the end, it doesn't really matter if i like it or not. That's for OP to decide.Yup,

* i5 6500 - 4 cores clocked at 3.2Ghz with a 3.6Ghz turbo clock.

* Xeon E3-1231 - 4 cores / 8 threads (8 threads means that it acts like it has 8 cores) clocked at 3.4Ghz with a 3.8Ghz turbo clockI can guaranty that you won't be able to see the difference with your naked eye. I'm slightly over budget but I included a 500gb ssd for your os and games, good hdd's for a raid 1 setup and 2 nice ips monitors.

* An i7 is going to help streaming at high definition and with a high bit rate. It would be a shame to put an i5 Haswell in a 4.5 - 5k build.

* I did a bit of twitch streaming (to make millions... it didn't work out lol). All my games were on my 1tb wd blue and i had my os on my 120gb V300 (fml). you would be surprised at how many people complain about loading screens. so in this case i wouldn't call a 500gb ssd an unnecessary upgrade.

* And yes, op was pretty clear about having his os on a ssd, but this is /r/buildapc and most of the time when people are posting here they're not 100% sure what to get and we help guide them in the right direction by having this kind of debate :p 

So hopefully this gives op some insight and he can decide what to do :)Ahhh that's True. My build is way over powered if it's music streaming lol.Kinda like my build? lol 


Good changes.Not the 3tb seagate's lol. Make sure to do it with the 3tb wd red's./u/phamtor 's build is a very good recomendation, but if you want to swap the ssd for a hdd, you could get quite a bit more gpu horse power.

* cpu is also an in-store pickup.

The Xeon is pretty much the exact same as an i7. Stick with an NVidia gpu so you can use cuda cores for cad. Also a nice cheap ips monitor.

The Kingston kit I went is more of a personal choice, but the ram you chose will work perfectly fine. Same goes for the cheaper 2TB seagate drives. The WD red's were 'made' for raid configurations. I heard nothing but good things about xfx 390 but since you have experience with it, you'll be able to provide better input. The psu you chose isn't on the g2's level but it's still a great unit and op won't run into any problems with it. 


OP go with this build but use the pci ssd in my build.

+1Both are great builds, personally I'd go with mine just because it's newer hardware but you should go with /u/sergeantminor 's build because it offer a lot more 'bang/buck' and the monitor he included is sexy as hell.You would lose the 980ti and get a r9 390 along with a cheaper psu and case. Nice build, the fury isn't as powerful as a 980ti but it should play most games pretty well and it's within OP's budget.


+1Yup that would be the next step.You won't be able to put an unlocked chip but if you ever needed the power of an i7, you could put a Xeon in there./u/thisisformyIA 's build is pretty good, so I'm going to offer something different. This build is a bit more weighted on 3D animation / workstation side. 

Parts:

* Cpu - I went with a 5820k because of the 6 cores / 12 threads, it's slightly outperformed by the  6700k in gaming but you'll see a noticeable boost in multi-threaded software.

* Cpu cooler - The 5820k overclocks very well so won't need a super loud water cooler. The dark rock performs almost as well as a h100i/x61 krakenwhile being almost silent (+ IMO, it's one of the best looking coolers). If you want make a custom loop for your cpu and gpu, you'll be looking at another $700 minimum (for good quality parts).

* Motherboard - I went with an all black motherboard that's good quality and has a good amount of features.

* Ram - You might be ok with 16gb ram, but I put in 32gb so you wont have to worry about it. You could probably save another $40 by going with a cheaper kit but this one is color matched it's 3200mhz (mobo only supports 3000mhz).

* Storage - Good storage combo, 250gb m.2 ssd / 2tb hdd

* Gpu - Normally I'd stay away from a Titan x and get a 980ti, but the 3072 Cuda cores are going to be really helpful with your type of work.

* Psu - Excellent quality power supply, 850w wont cut it if you want to SLI.

* Case - Very high quality silent case with good sound proofing.

* Monitor - 144hz IPS g-sync monitor. doesn't get much better than that.

* kb/mouse - I went with a slightly overprices k70 RGB, but it looks amazing when you take the time to program it. IMO the G502 is one of the best mice on the market.

Like I said this is just giving you a different type of build since /u/thisisformyIA already gave you a good workstation/gaming build. This one is better but also more expensive.

Good luck!

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-09 08:55 EST-0500 |&gt; The graphics card says it has "crossfire support" but the motherboard says it doesn't. 

* Crossfire - using 2 or more AMD graphics cards.

* SLI  - using 2 or more NVidia graphics cards (Has to be the same gpu / different brand is ok). 

You would need a z97 motherboad for SLI and i think you can use crossfire on some h97 boards, either way you're going to have to spend around $80-$90 on a motherboad to get this feature. You would only want to crossfire/sli if you can't initially afford a high end card.  

&gt;Speaking of the graphics card, that looks to be quite the monster card, and that's awesome. I know it would lessen the future-proofing, but would dropping it back to a lesser (4gb?) card and adding another 8gb of ram balance out at all?

Dropping to a 380 and putting in 16gb ram would be a terrible idea lol (FPS wise). If you really need 16gb, I'd drop the ssd. And if you don't mind using cheaper quality parts you get a cheaper ssd, psu to fit 16gb ram in your build. IMO you should just invest the extra $30 that it's going to cost to get 16gb.

&gt;I don't see a cd/dvd drive? They're still a thing, right?

Yeah you'll rarely see cd drives in builds these days lol. Everybody uses bootable usb's to install os's.

Use /u/sergeantminor 's build. Don't get an i7 4790k, it'll do absolutely nothing (extra 1-3 fps in some games) for a gaming build. If you want to get a crazy high clock speed (4.5ghz - 4.7ghz), swap the cpu cooler for a h100i or kraken x61.

The 970 and 390 are almost the same, the 390 performs slightly better and it's much better suited for heavily modded games. Both of them max out most games at 60+ fps at 1080p. Nobody get 980's anymore, they're extremely overpriced. You either get a 390 or 980ti.haha no problem, good luck!This is all you would need to play FO4 on high settings 60fps at 1080p. Your psu is on it's last legs if it's 6 years old so i put in a new one. I also added a nice IPS monitor. Windows 10 is only free if you currently have Windows 7 or 8/8.1. With the cost of cases you may as well get a new one as well.

Yeah a 390 will handle pretty much anything at 1080p.You definitely don't need to spend 1500 on a 1080p streaming machine. I'd go with the i7 to help streaming in high definition and high bit rate, but you could probably get away with an i5.

Windows 7 is a pain in the ass to do by usb, because you have to find a .iso and Microsoft doesn't make the usb bootable for you like they do with windows 8.1 [or 10](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10). So you don't want to hunt down an iso for windows 7 and use software like Rufus to make the usb bootable, either get a  \u20ac10 cd drive or get Win 8.1 or 10 to use the media creation tool.Good luck.Yeah i recommended 7 because it's much cheaper than 8.1 or 10 but it just requires a bit more work to install.[How to install Windows 8.1 / 10 with a usb](https://protege-secure.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ouvdesessawr-cwasignin/ouverturesession-signin-eng.html) You won't need a $500 machine to play old games or to do some browsing :). This build with your 660 will work really well with old games and even some new ones! Migrate your OS to the ssd and you'll a pretty quick pc. And forget your son, build it yourself :D

But with the price difference between the 850 m.2 and 950 m.2, I'd just go to a pci ssd to avoid the m.2 lane/sata port blocking.Here's a mini-itx build within your budget. The integrated graphics on the g2358 will be enough to play to old games and if you ever want to play some newer ones, you could easily add a 750ti in this build.

So just use some software like [acronis](www.acronis.com) to back up your system image and then put it back on once you re-formatted the ssd.Are you talking about the z97 killer?

Good luck!It's possible that an NVidia gpu might perform better at vanilla FO4 (for now), but once you start adding mods, you don't want to run into issues with the 970's 3.5gb Vram.You could run LoL and cs on a potato but you'll need something like this to run FO4 well.

There isn't a huge difference between Semi-Modular and Fully-Modular, the xfx is a very high quality unit. If you want a good quality Fully-Modular psu it's going to cost you more.Np good luck :DIt's a great gpu. It's either that or a 980ti, but that's a bit overkill for 1080p.See if you can find a 550w EVGA GS or G2.If you want usb 3.0 support, a decent headset and 16gb ram, all you would have to do is swap the 390 for 280x. It'll still get 60fps on a lot of games at high setting but you'll probably need to replace it in a couple years. I wouldn't drop down to a 120Gb ssd if you plan on putting games on it, it's a pain in the ass to constantly move things around so you can fit a game on it. 250gb is a good size.

&gt; Should I be worried about not using a Nvidia graphics card on your second build? I've heard that Nvidia is the way to go.

Last year this was the case but, it's been proven that a 390 is better than a 970. The 970 is still a great gpu, but the 390 is slightly better.

&gt; with regards to the first build, shouldn't I be using an i7? i'm not 100% sure but just from other builds I've seen.

An i7 will do do absolutely nothing in 99.9% of games. Most of the time you're looking at an extra 1 - 4 fps. It's only really useful you want to do some video rendering, 3d animation, streaming etc...Not really what I'm asking :/Thanks!what resolution are your monitors?Here you go, i7, 980ti, 1440p ips monitor, "Future proof" (Add a 980ti without changing anything) ---&gt; within budget :)

The noctua keeps up to the h100i in cooling while not sounding like a lawn mower.

Sure the r5 is an amazing case but so is the s340. If op wants to spend \u00a330 more for the r5, all the power to him.

DDR4 vs DDR3. Theres absolutely zero difference between the two in a gaming build, we're talking a fraction of a fps. [anandtech review](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8959/ddr4-haswell-e-scaling-review-2133-to-3200-with-gskill-corsair-adata-and-crucial/8). Same goes for ram speed, as long as you have 1600mgz, you're fine.as i said before:

&gt; I really want to know if fallout needs 4 physical cores to run

I don't care what gpu is paired with it. The EVGA 980ti sc 2.0 is one of the best 980ti's. It performs cooler/quieter and is able to be overclocked higher than the msi.Exactly, if you want future proofing , go with air over water, That pump is going to break long before the air cooler is.i know lolHere's good video on it --&gt; [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65-pqVTykMc)Yes they are but it's going to be out lasted by a NH-D14. I'm sorry corsair doesn't touch Noctua when it comes to cooling...Hmm the MSI might actually get a higher overclock then the EVGA but the EVGA does come with a back plate an a longer warranty :P. I'm sure you'll be happy with whichever one you get.Please do! This is pretty much the kind of setup i was wondering about.Thanks :)Haha welcome to the master race! all kidding and benchmarks aside, 95% of all the sli 980ti builds on this sub and /r/buildapc with be with evga sc acx 2.0 's. Don't start drowning yourself in benchmarks and reviews, you'll never be able to make a decision lol. It's good to do research, but overdoing it is almost as bad as doing non at all.no problem, good luck!Recording for what? video editing,? Youtube uploads? other?Oh ok lol, he'll be fine with something like this. He'll be able to max out 60fps most games at 1080p.

No psu in your build?Nice catch on the MSI 390. This build won't draw more than ~ 430W at full load so op will be fine with 550.You could drop  down to a ~ $175 4gb 380 but it won't have nearly same performance as a 390.LolAll depends how much he wants to save. He'll save about $130 dropping down to a 380 4gb and about $60 dropping down to a 290, you also have to find one without the reference cooler.Lots of storage? 1tb, 2tb 10tb? raid?At the high end of your budget, but it's a pretty powerful 1440p build. Got an overkill psu so you can sli in the future.

If you don't care for 1440p, you can make a 1080p version of this for about $1200.

I'll give the build an edit.Ahh ok, makes sense.At that resolution, an APU should be able to handle FO4 at decent frames. If you decide to go with this build, save up for a 750ti.

I used to stream but it was with a cheap turtle beach headset, so you might be better off looking at reviews for a good microphone since I left you a good chunk of your budget.

I decided to go with a 5820k  over Skylake just because a 6700k is hard to find and it's overpriced imo.

Also went with a 980ti SLI so you'll hit 60+fps at 4k on most games.

I added a nice ips 4k monitor with a cheap ips 1080p monitor so you can keep an eye on chat while you stream.

For storage I went with a 960gb ssd so your viewers won't get pist at all the FO4 loading screens lol. Also added a 2TB hdd for all other media.

There are a ton of good youtube videos that will show you how to properly overclock. Linus tech tips and jayztwocents are the best imo.

If anything you have twice the chance at having a ssd fail with raid 0.[8 fps more?](http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/1970-gtx-980-ti-sli-benchmark-vs-sli-980-titan-x/Page-2) That's not what I'm seeing...I love the g3258 but it's 2 cores have a really hard time with FO4 :/Wrong person XD but I agree!Swap the cpu for a 4170 and use that money to get a 240GB ssd .This build makes the most sense op, why would you pay $269 for a Skylake cpu clocked at 2.7ghz when you can get a much better haswell cpu clocked at 3.2ghz for an extra $6.What resolution is your monitor?Ahh ok, i miss read your post, i though you already had one.

With your budget, I'd probably shoot for 1440p, 4k is nice but even a 980ti SLI has a hard time [maintaining](http://techbuyersguru.com/taking-4k-gaming-challenge-gtx-980-ti-sli?page=2) 60+fps depending if the game has good support for sli, but a single 980ti at 1440p usually [averages](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2015-nvidia-geforce-gtx-980-ti-review) 75+fps. So IMO, you'll get more bang/buck at 1440p over 4k.

Normally i wouldn't put an i7 in a gaming build just because you can affored it but since you have access to a microcenter, you can get a 4790k at 249.99 which is an amazing deal. Newer games are starting to take advantage of the number of cores your cpu hase (The 4790k has 4 cores and 8 threads). [This Fallout 4 benchmark](http://www.gamersnexus.net/game-bench/2182-fallout-4-cpu-benchmark-huge-performance-difference) shows that you get a significant fps boost with a 4790k over a 4690k or 6600k, plus it'll help you stream in hd and at a high bit rate.

I went with a x61 Kraken (watercooler) that will get the 4790k up to 4.7ghz. Here's a good overclocking guide from [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CHs5_TdpXE).

I went with a black/red motherboard that has a good amount of features and it can SLI if you ever decide to take that route.

I added 16gb ram, it's not entirely necessary for a gaming build (8gb is the norm), but it may be recommended in the next couple years.

For storage, i went with a 480gb ssd which will give you plenty of room for you games and a 1tb hdd to store everything else.

A 980ti is the sweet spot for 1440p gaming, so that what I went with.

For the case i went with a R5 by Fractal, they make amazing quality/sound proofed cases and it'll have a bunch of room for you.

I opted to go for a high quality 850w psu in case you decide to SLI in the future.

As requested i added an awesome AC wifi adapter.

I was able to add a Mechanical keyboard, great gaming mouse and a 27" IPS 1440p monitor in your budget without even coming close to your $2500 budget.

You also won't have to deal with any mail-in rebates as well.

Go with this OP.What resolution is you monitor?I'd go with this then, there's no need to buy an overpriced Skylake chip or spend $800+ on a 980ti for 1080p gaming. 

And as a NVidia fanboy and 970 owner, you should get a 390. They're the same price and the 390 is a bit better.

This build is under budget and more powerful than yours. Reuse your ram and hdd.

You could upgrade the 480gb to a 1tb ssd but that'll cost you another $100.What resolution is your monitor?If you don't mind the mail-in's you can get an i3, 750ti, ssd and an ips monitor. Although this is a bit overkill for LoL since you could get decent frames on fallout 4 at med - high settings.

I decided to go with a 980ti SLI over a fury x crossfire because of the lower tdp, G-sync monitor and you wont have to look at all the AIO cables from the fury x, but whichever one you go with you'll get some pretty good performance.

I don't normally put an i7 in a gaming build, but some games (fallout 4) will take advantage of it and at 4k anything that gives you an fps boost is a +.

Since you wanted quiet, i added a Dark rock pro 3 instead of a water cooler, normally I'd add a D-15 by Noctua but they're currently out of stock.

Same with the ram, 16gb isn't entirely necessary for gaming but it'll probably be recommended in the next couple years. 

I included 2 480gb ssd's for a raid 1 setup and a 1tb hdd.

I'm going with a red/black theme for this build so you'll be paying a bit of a premium for the red/black MSI 980ti's. Although they overclock and perform very well.

The Corsair RM that you mentioned is ok, but definitely not what i would consider a high quality psu for this build. If you wanted an extreamly quiet Corsair psu, look at the AX and HX series. The XFX Pro series i added is pretty awesome for the price.

Added Windows 10 pro as requested.

I went with a 28" 4k G-sync monitor mechanical keyboard and great gaming mouse.

I've never setup a build for anyone using this 4k monitor so i can't really give you any input on it.The only thing i might add is a 240gb ssd, but besides that, adding more performance would just be overkill for what you're looking for.Be careful how you say 'giving him a free OS', mods are going to be all over you.

But if op is able to get a free os, I'd probably go for something like this. I don't see a point in adding more raw performance to his build since it's already enough for his/her needs so i added a windowed case (since op wanted one) with a semi modular psu (I know, i know it's a cx... it'll be fine with this low load machine) and i added a 240gb sdd so he can put his os and a couple games on it for quicker loading times.

And why would you go Skylake with that price difference, op will just be pissing money away.To get everything out of that motherboard, this is what you're looking at. This will play most AAA games at high-max settings 40-60fps. I didn't include the r5 that you wanted because that would cut into the performance quite a bit so i changed that to a similar style but cheaper case. This Build is $620 with free shipping on every part.

You also have mail-ins on the cpu cooler, gpu and case that will reduce the price as well.

&gt; I Thought about a i5 4460 but my x4 740 will most likely bottleneck it.

This doesn't really make sense? Both of them are cpu's. A 4460 would be a pretty huge upgrade but you have to get a new motherboard as well because they aren't the same socket. 

Personally this would be the best upgrade IMO. You won't need to buy a new motherboard.

Edit: Spelling

I've seen 4460/980ti builds working perfectly together.I'd drop the gpu down to a gtx 950 or 750ti, but that will only save you ~ $40 and you'll be losing quite a bit of performance.You could just add the 380 i suggested in your current build, but your x4 740 will most likely bottleneck it a bit in higher demanding games.

In a perfect world if you could increase your budget a bit I'd go with this since it has more of an upgrade path.

It's got the same amount of power as an i7 but you can't overclock it.

I also added another 8gb ram (16gb total).

Swapped out the kb/m for a wireless set and added a wifi adapter.

You\u2019re not going to get much better, you could consider a 5820k from microcenter at $320, but imo a 4790k at $250 is unbeatable.

&gt;  CPU cooler: Same question.

For cooling, you have 3 options:

* The Dark Rock Pro 3 in my build

* A Noctua NH-D14

* Or a Noctua NH-D15 (This one has a 4 pin connector so you can control the fan speed)

All 3 of them are amazing silent fan coolers but the DRP3 is definitely the most aesthetically pleasing.

&gt; 3. Thanks for suggesting 32 GB. I saw several builds in this sub that were saying 8 and I was just like "Wait do what now." Also, how does this RAM compare to others? Tangentially, how does this motherboard compare to other options?

Personally I think 16gb would be enough for you, but $120 for 32gb is pretty damn cheap. You might notice a slight difference if you were to go with 3200mhz ddr4 ram, but it\u2019s not worth the premium that you\u2019d have to pay to get (Like changing the entire build to Skylake or Haswell-E).
The only thing that differentiates motherboards is the features (Color Scheme, SLI/x-fire, raid, max supported ram, M.2 storage, USB 3.0 headers etc\u2026). 
My reasons for choosing the MSI Gaming 5:

* Can it SLI / X-fire? Yes

* Does it look nice? Yes

* Does it have good reviews? yes

* Does it cost a fortune? no

&gt;  I totally forgot about the 2TB external I already own. Should I drop this 2TB drive?

All depends if you think it enough and if it\u2019s fast enough for you.


&gt;  Video Card: Is this the best bang for the buck? How much drop is there for the next notch down?

The next step down would be a r9 390 (less than half the cost of a 980ti), it\u2019s a great gpu for 1080p.

&gt; Cases seem to be an interesting factor that I totally dunno squat about. Is this one a good size? Or what advantages does it have over something ~$20 cheaper?

This case is worth quite a bit more than $79 imo, it\u2019s one of the best when it comes to size, layout and sound proofing. I\u2019d stick with this case, but if you want to cut $20, get a NZXT S340 (It\u2019s a similar style).

&gt; Power Supply: bang/buck question.

Very good bang/buck

&gt; Monitor: One 27" is too big for my eyeballs. I'm currently operating on a 13" and fullscreen things basically never. demonmit suggested one 144Hz and another monitor setup that I thought was intriguing. What would be your suggestion to that regard? I would like the dual monitor setup.

13\u201d to 27 would be quite an upgrade (Insert that\u2019s what she said joke here). IMO, unless you\u2019re a pro cs or moba player, 144hz is a bit of a waste money considering how much cost it adds onto the monitor ($100 - $300) and you lose the ips panel (on most monitors).

&gt; Keyboard: Again, advantages of this and bang/buck?

Great bang/buck considering it\u2019s a mechanical keyboard.

&gt; Keeping the above questions in mind, if you had to knock $200 off the build, what would you do?

Since you're not at 1080p yet and you're not a fan of the 27" display, I'll swap the 1440p monitor out for 2 23" 1080p monitors. Since it's a resolution drop, you won't need the 980ti, a 390 is perfect for 1080p 60hz. Just that drops the build down to $1520 before rebates and  $1400 after rebates.

I made a powerful mini-itx build that will easily max out LoL while streaming in hd and at a high bit rate (The cpu is from micro center).

Mini-itx builds are a little more difficult to put together because of the lack of room but they're a lot more satisfying once you're done :D. Plus since you have that monster psu, it'll make it easier for you since it's fully modular.

Part:

* 4790k. Newer games are starting to utilize hyper-threaded cpus like [Fallout 4](http://www.gamersnexus.net/game-bench/2182-fallout-4-cpu-benchmark-huge-performance-difference). Skylake is pretty overpriced and it's hard to get a hold of a 6700k right now so if you're building soon, go Haswell.

* Went with an aesthetically pleasing cpu cooler that's near silent under load. 

* Good motherboard that can SLI.

* 16gb ram. Not entirely necessary but it's probably going to be recommended in a couple years.

* 480gb ssd / 1tb hdd storage combo

* These 980ti's were made for overclocking so you'll pump out the most fps with these.

* Excellent quality sound proofed case.

* I went with a beefy psu that can handle an overclocked cpu and gpu's.

* The monitor is a nice 4k ips panel. I also went with a mechanical keyboard, great gaming mouse and a good pair of headphones.

So if you can use your '10%' amazon discount, this build will cost around $2970. 

Edit: Forgot to link i3 vs i5 vs i7 fallout 4 link lol

Edit 2: Made a pleb move and put a free-sync monitor with a 980ti sli

My system is about $1700 CDN and i use $20 turtle beache x11's lol. Are they good? no, but they work.Haha I'm due for an upgrade.Agreed the nex isn't the greatest psu but 390 definitely don't run hot enough to thermal throttle. At full load it stays in the mid 60's.All I've been hearing is that adobe is moving over to openCL. Nobody pointed out that you can get a 4590 from microcenter for pretty cheap, also added a 390 that max out most AAA games at 1080.

It keeps the temps reasonably low when the cpu is at full load.Because I have an unlocked cpu in my build (overclocking = better performance and longevity). I don't hate Skylake at all, it's just overpriced. It would be silly to get a locked 6700 over an unlocked 4790k for $30 more. OP wants longevity, a 4790k I'd going to outlast 6700.That's True, you'd need a x99 motherboard for a 5820k instead of a z97 for a 4790k and a 5820k/x99 uses ddr4 ram instead of ddr3.

It's definitely not silent, but as you said we're competing with a Mac... I hate apple... and Starbucks... and people who Skype on a mac in Starbucks...Are you ok with mail-ins? It's $470 before rebates and $425 after. It's probably the best you can do in that price range but you'll easily handle cs maxed out and you'll be able to get 40-50fps on gta5 at med-high settings (1080p).

OP just has to mow the lawn to get a better psu lolI'm guessing you plan to stream poker and not AAA games? This is a mini-itx (small form factor) build that will handle anything you throw at it.

The only problem is that you only have 6 sata connectors on a mini board. I went with 4 x 5tb hdd's for raid 10 (10tb storage) and 2 x 512gb ssd (raid 1 or 0 depending on what you want). The case is a bit expensive but it has 6 drive bays so you'll be to organize your drives so you don't restrict air flow ([you may want some 2.5" adapters so you can put your ssd's there as well](http://www.amazon.com/SABRENT-Inches-Internal-Mounting-BK-HDDH/dp/B00G57BN1M)). Another problem with m-itx is that it only supports up to 16gb ram, it should be enough for you, but you that's the maximum so take that into consideration. Overall this is a pretty awesome build that should meet all of your criteria.

[Here's a really good guide for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1Q8ksRI1Eo)Go with a 5820k over a 6700k if you want to spend a bit more on a cpu. IMO the is ROG Swift is pretty overpriced, you're not going to hit 144fps in most games with a single 980ti. I'd swap the monitor a 60hz ips 1440p. But besides that, /u/andysaurus_rex's first build is pretty solid.Sell your 610 for $10 it's not relevant anymore lol :p. This is the best i can do with your budget (All parts from Amazon), I'd suggest ordering off of different sites, it'll make this build quite a bit cheaper and you might be able to fit a monitor into your budget.

This build will max almost every AAA 60fps so you'll get that smooth good looking gameplay that you're looking for. One of the monitors is a bit more expensive because it can swivel 45\u00b0 so you can use portrait mode which is a nice feature for coding (speaking from experience). I also went with a cherry mx-blue keyboard, imo blue's and brown's are the best for typing.

The motherboard has an HDMI, 6 x usb 3.0 / 2 x usb 2.0 (2 x usb 3.0 on the case) and 6 sata connectors. I think this meets all of your requirements.

I thought there was only room for 2 dimms, so yes op should add 2x4gb ram.Back in the day, cuda was a lot better but opencl isn't to far behind now.[Just for future reference](http://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/powercolor-radeon-r9-390-pcs-8gb-review,9.html) ;)If they don't specify, it's usually the reference cards. Here you go, a black and white build for amazon with a 144hz monitor. Just going to let you know that you're not hit 144fps in AAA games with a 390, you would need a 980ti for that but that'll blow your budget by quite a bit. The [motherboard](http://www.amazon.de/MSI-7922-004R-Mainboard-Express-Speicher/dp/B00OIKLODK) isn't showing up on pcpp, so i had to manually enter it in the build.

That's True (I think it's 189.99) but then the price of the board doubles, plus a cpu cooler and a better psu.Haha i didn't have much budget left for the case, and then i seen the snow commander :p. 

You'll be fine with 8gb ram for a few years.

Just get the cheapest os, you can upgrade to windows 10 for free :)

Personally if you don't want to spend more on a hdd, a 1tb hdd is a good star, I have ~ 50 steam games and my 1tb hdd isn't full yet. Then it would be a waste of $30 to get it over a 4590 :pYou'll hit 45-60fps on med-high setting in FO4 with this build (1080p).

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-12-07 15:59 EST-0500 |Good luck!Hi, I finished my programming degree a couple years ago and instead of paying for classes, look to YouTube. [Bucky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl-zzrqQoSE) is probably one of the best youtubers at teaching java, he's very articulate and teaches everything from basics like installing and using [eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/)  all the way up to polymorphism and multi-threading. Best of all, IT"S FREE, i had to pay 15k to listen to professors that could barely speak speak English. 

On to the hardware...

I've decided to offer something a little different compared to the other builds. I'm going to suggest getting an unlocked cpu so you and your son can learn overclocking. It's going to give you guys the opportunity to fine tune the system. It's much more satisfying having pc that you personally customized to run faster. Not to worry though it's completely safe and somewhat easy to do, it just takes some time and patience for the system to be stable. Here's a really good [guide](http://wolframpc.blogspot.ca/2012/01/guide-to-overclocking-part-1.html) ([and another](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8227/devils-canyon-review-intel-core-i7-4790k-and-i5-4690k/2)) that you and you son can go through and once you go through that you can follow along with [Linus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CHs5_TdpXE). And after all that if you guys are confident, you can overclock the gpu :)

Parts:

* 4690k, Awesome cpu that can be overclocked.

* Hyper 212 evo, Great budget air cooler that will keep the cpu cool.

* Went with a cool red/black theme build. (motherboard is red/black)

* 2x4gb ram 

* For storage i added a 250gb ssd for his OS and some software and a 1tb hdd for all his games.

* The graphics card is going to play almost every game maxed out at 1080p.

* The case is pretty nice and it has a good size size window on the side.

* I added a good quality power supply that has modular cables so it'll make it easier for you guys to hook everything up.

Anyways that's my suggestion, good luck to you and your son!

It won't perform to well in Cities and fallout 4. I'd go with this. Do you already have a psu or do you need a new one? If you already have one, i don't see this using up more power than your previous cpu/mobo.

You'd be using the same motherboard with a g3258, so if you go with what i suggested, you'd be doing both :pJust a smidge over budget but there a mechanical keyboard and great gaming mouse, just swap them out if you can't go over $700.

Keep all your original boxes/static bags. Take the pc apart and put everything back in it's respective box then you could either ship it or take it with you.

It's a pretty solid air cooler.If you're on a bit of a budget, a s340 is pretty good.S340, sexy in a classy kind of way while being friendly on the wallet.Made a few changes:

* Cheaper but equivalent board (White/black theme)
* Better Cpu cooler
* Better hdd, Don't get a green WD.
* Swapped the 970 for a 390, it's better.
* Better quality white case
* Added a good quality psu.


Overall a bit cheaper than your build. You should drive to Germany or something because some of those parts are very expensive and you don't have a huge selection.

You should shoot for 1440p, a single 980ti works great at that resolution, plus you have a much bigger selection of monitors.Yeah for sure, playing 1080p on a native 4k isn't bad but IMO you have a lot more options at 1440p. 

Whats your current setup/budget?Personally this would be my first choice. 1440p Free-sync. Then add another 390 latter on.

To spend that kind of money and barely be able to maintain 45fps... it's not for me.If you're going to add a cheap psu, why did you add a 600w? At full load this system won't even hit 400w.Sure, for cases with good cable management, look at a R200 ~ $50, S340 ~ $60 and a R4/R5 ~ $95 - $110.

You only need a 8gb ram in a gaming build and ram speeds won't make a difference either (as long as you have at least 1600mhz).

You're spending to much on a 500gb ssd, that money could be spent elsewhere. 250gb is still good for your OS and quite a few games.Yes lol, op won't need 200w's of overhead for a marginal gpu overclock.Yes but it's always better to go with quality over quantity.

Edit: spellingsAn Antec HCG is only $4 more. It's semi modular, has a much better build quality and it's made by Seasonic.

Here's decent psu tier [list](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.html) that get updated pretty often.

Here's a [review](http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/antec-high-current-gamer-520-w-power-supply-review/11/) about the antec.

And here's another [review](http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Antec/HCG-520/8.html)

All of this should be a compelling argument.Small, silent and powerfull.

The build that you made is alright, but it definitely won't be silent with those 2 msi 390's and h100 cooler.

I gave you an alternative here. Since you wanted a small build, i made it an ITX form factor so it can fit almost anywhere.

Wen't with a very quiet Noctua air cooler instead of a loud water pump.

Going with a 980ti instead of a 390 x-fire. It'll be much quieter and more reliable (not all games are optimized for a x-fire setup).

Corsair 250D. (enough said)

Also added a very high quality/quiet G2.

Went with windows 8.1, it's cheaper and you can upgrade to 10 for free.

If op can afford the upfront cost, it's definitely worth it.&gt;For users on a limited budget and for office or download PCs this PSU is ideal.

lolWell a 4690k draws 88 watts and a 980ti will draw 250 watts. Pcpp estimates that the whole system will draw a maximum of 457W. so 460W is a safe assumption.True, but CS and witcher are two completely different animals at 4k.It's good build but you're still missing an OS and monitor.Have you already purchased the parts? if not there are a lot of improvements that can be made. Judging by the build I'm guessing it's some kind of cad machine? By the looks of it, your budget is around 650?

An Intel chip would perform better than an APU. Since you'd using the 970 for it's cuda cores (Still assuming it's a cad machine), there's no point in getting an APU. Do not get a V300, it's probably the worst ssd on the market. I went with a 250gb sdd/ 1tb hdd for storage. 

If this is a gaming build don't get the psu in this build. If it's not a gaming build then you're fine.

Here are my changes:

* Skylake i5

* white/black z170 board

* 16gb ddr4 

* I put in a 380, they generally perform better than 960's. Also don't get a 4gb version for 1080p.

* Personally i find that the S340 is a lot nicer, the only difference is that you doesn't have a cd drive bay. Most people will just connect it to do their cd installs then remove the drive.

* Since this isn't primarily a  gaming build a cx psu should be ok, 500w is more than enough.

* If you need a wifi adapter, get the ac gigabyte. It's on of the best one on the market right now.

* Overall white/black theme.

* This is a pretty awesome build, I went with a silent all black theme. The 5820k can easily be overclock to 4ghz on air. 

* 32gb of ddr4, because you can afford it.

* Added a 500gb ssd with a 2x2tb hdd setup.

* Put in a Titan x for all that cuda!

* Put in a very high quality 650w G2

* Last but not least a 28" 4k monitor.

* Just put a basic keyboard/mouse combo. That's more of a user preference.

Here's well balanced gaming / Dev machine that's on the lower end of your budget.

* I went with a hyper-threaded Xeon, It's exactly like an i7 but you can't overclock it. (an i7 with with a cpu cooler would have been hard to fit in your budget).

* Basic motherboard with usb 3.0.

* 16gb ram, that should be fine with the software you'll be using.

* 250gb ssd / 1tb hdd combo for storage.

* Went with a 970 for those cuda cores when you're doing some dev work.

* Nice case and very high quality psu.

An argument can be made for a 265 though.This is an excellent build for Minecraft, League of Legends, Dota 2, cs:go, Sims etc... It'll even play newer high demanding games (medium-high settings/30fps).

I wouldn't recommend it for streaming though, a better cpu would be required.Here's probably the best you can do with your budget, I'd prefer to add a Titan x in there for video editing, but i couldn't fit it into the budget.

* Hyper-threaded Xeon (same thing as an i7 but i you can't overclock it)

* Basic motherboard and 16gb ram

* 250gb ssd / 1tb hdd for storage.

* 980ti should get 45 fps on high settings at 4k

* very high quality psu and a nice case.

On top of that Vram doesn't stack.Here's some [documentation](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#multi-device-system) that cuda cores can stack. Some further research will have to be done to figure out what programs (if any) can utilize SLI.For 60 more, I'd get a r9 380 instead of a 750ti. 

As for 2x4gb vs 1x8gb, personally I prefer 2x4gb because it's fail safe but usually 1x8gb is cheaper plus you can upgrade to 16gb if need be.:DIt'll be fine, it's got over 100 watts of overhead on a non overclocking build.I'd add another later if he runs out of space. Better to do that than sacrifice on other hardware.NBA 2k15, last of us, destiny, assassin's creed black flag plus a year of ps plus.Lol definitely not, it's one of the highest quality psu's on the market.Look for a bx100 or a 850 evo, both are good ssd's.

If you want a better gpu, get either a r9 380 or gtx 960 (the 2GB versions). The 380 is a bit better but just get whichever is cheaper.

An i5 4460 is a pretty good cpu.

Yes a 650 would be better especially if he want to OC. OP should get the 650 for an extra $10 but Power efficiency isn't the same thing as 20 years ago.

 A good quality 550W gold efficiency psu will easily power a non overclocking 980ti build for years. Saying otherwise would be wrong.Knowing - Nicholas CageThis is probably the best you can do if you need everything (Monitor, mouse/kb, os, and tower).

* Great cpu that performs well and stays cool with its stock cooler.
.
* Basic mini ITX motherboard.

* 1x8gb ram. Left room for an upgrade latter on down the road.

* 240gb ssd / 1tb hdd storage combo.

* R9 390, it should max out most games at 1080p (60pfs) for the next 3 - 5 years.

* Added a BF Prodigy (one of the cases on your list.) I've put a few builds together in the mini itx version and it's a little bit of a pain in the ass but just be patient and it'll work out.

* Added a great psu. In a mini ITX build, a modular psu is a must have so you don't obstruct airflow with useless cables.

* You could get a cheaper monitor but you'll really like this one, it\u2019s an IPS, so the colors are going to look very nice.

* I added Windows 8.1 because it's cheaper and you can upgrade to 10 for free.

* Just went with a basic mouse/kb combo.

The only thing you have to worry about screwing up is the cpu, everything else is pretty durable. When you're putting the cpu in don't force it, it has to drop into place. 

Just do your research and watch a ton of YouTube videos on how to assemble a pc, specifically with that case as a mini ITX can be a bit of a pain in the ass, but once is all up and running it's a pretty good feeling.

For 1.8k, I'd go for something like this. 

* Brand new Skylake 6600k. 

* hyper 212 evo, best bang/buck air cooler on the market.

* Mini ITX board with AC wifi.

* 1x8gb ram. Leave room to upgrade to 16gb if need be.

* 250gb ssd / 1tb hdd storage combo.

* I put a 980ti in this build because you can afford it and will max out any game at a minimum of 60fps for 5 years at the very least. 

* Added the highest quality power supply on the market to power this system.

* The case i chose is a very small windowed mini itx that can fit on most desks without taking up to much room.

To get this kind of build, i had to cheap out on the mouse/kb and monitor. A 980ti would normally be considered overkill for a 60hz 1080p, but it also leaves the possibility to upgrade to a nice 1440p monitor in the future.

* Get a cheaper board that still has crossfire support.

* Cheaper air cpu cooler. (It's still able to get a 6600k over 4ghz)

* Cheaper but still solid ssd/hdd combo

* Changed the 390 to a Sapphire Nitro. (Performs cooler than the MSI)

* Cheaper similar case.

* I left the 850w g2 for a future x-fire because a single 390 isn't going to be enough to maintain 60fps on newer games at high-max settings

It's might make a difference of 1 or 2 frames for a crossfire setup.No problem, as long as the h100i is $75 more 'cool'. Thanks for the heads up, I've never ordered from them.&gt; don't get the Sapphire. IIRC, it's voltage locked.

Source? I've never heard that about the Nitro before.Surprisingly the Sapphire Nitro 390 runs cooler than most of the 970's. [Source](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/sapphire-nitro-r9-390-8g-d5,4245.html#p11)cooler = more overclock potential = better gpu Edit: Not sure this was worth gold, but thanks!


It's not the most optimal build, but for a $700 budget, it's a good place to start. 

The hypethreaded i3 may bottleneck the 390 in cpu intensive games but in most cases it'll be fine and max out almost everything at 1080p (60fps). 

I could only add a 1x8gb kit into your build but you could easily add another one if you need it. 

The three things i didn't cheap out on is the gpu, psu, and wifi adapter. I highly recommend gaming on a wired connection but if that's not possible the Gigabyte AC adapter is one of the best on the market.

Depending on how much money you want sink into it, you might want to X-fire 390's instead of buying a $850 980ti lol.

Look at some benchmarks before you take my word for it though.That cooler in a R5 will almost be silent.Lol my friend was able to get 30 fps on ultra (1080p) with a 4460/750ti 2gb on battlefront.Well done, definitely more balanced than my build.OP definitely won't have to upgrade a 390 in a year in a half lol. A 770 is almost three years old, it's still running strong and that's with 2gb Vram. 

8gb's of ram is going to enough for a couple years. I don't see games needing 16 for while unless you have 100 tabs and a few apps open.

If op can save a bit more and add a 390 in your build or add a 4590 in mine, it'll easily last 3 years at 1080p without upgrades.You did, but look at the quality of the parts lol.Had a system blow up with a lower quality psu... lol 

My top priorities in a gaming build:

* gpu

* cpu

* psu

I'd avoid using wifi dongles for gaming. They're barely able to maintain connection on cheap htpc unless you're 5 feet away from the router.That was a bit clearer lol. Point of the story is that pc gaming is a never ending money pit.Here's a pretty good build that will max out almost every game at 1080p (60fps).

* Solid i5 cpu.

* Basic board with usb 3.0

* 1x8gb ram, room for an upgrade to 16gb if it's needed.

* Smaller ssd but it's good for the os and a couple games.

* Large hdd.

* Awesome gpu that will last a few years.

* Decent cheap case.

* High quality psu.

* nice ips monitor with a decent mouse/kb combo.

* solid ssd/hdd combo

* Awesome 390 that should last 3 years at 1080p.

* cool and quiet case

* The psu i chose to put into this case is one of the best on the market. Currentely it's a little overkill (550W would be fine) but it leaves you room to upgrade to an unlocked chip/board in the future.

So alternatively she can buy a hyper 212 evo and overclock the 760 to 3.3 - 3.5ghz. They're a couple different gpu's that she can chose from (960,380,280x). Personally I'd get the 280x but the 4gb 960 has a pretty decent rebate, so may be a good choice. To round out her budget I added a 250gb ssd. If you can migrate windows on to it and put FO4 on it, she'll see an improvement there as well.

Her next upgrade after the gpu should be a cpu/mobo.

Overclocking has become much easier to do with all the tutorials that are going around. It basically gives you a performance upgrade for free.

* What is overclocking --&gt; [Link](http://www.howtogeek.com/165064/what-is-overclocking-the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-understanding-how-geeks-speed-up-their-pcs/)

* A lot of tutorials to overclock a 6600k can be found on YouTube.

What i put in this build:

* A new Skylake 6600k, great cpu.

* Great bang/buck cpu cooler. how to install --&gt; [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n47WBQI31eE)

* Standard z170 motherboard with a white/black theme.

* 2x4gb ram, still has room for another 2x4gb kit if you need it in the future.

* Included a great ssd / hdd combo

* Added a 390, It max's out pretty much every game at 1080p (60fps). 

* nice windowed case with one of the highest quality psu's on the market.

* don't worry about 1x8gb or 2x4gb, the board will know what to do.

* The sapphire Nitro 390 is the best because it runs the coolest. It even runs cooler than most 970's.

* usually people recommend a 650w psu for a 390, but in reality you can get away with a 520w in this build. A good psu will last a long time o that's why I got you one that will be able to handle upgrades.This build as is, should last 3 years without a single upgrade for 1080p gaming. 

If I were to spend to the limit I'd probably go for a h100i cpu cooler, 16gb ram, get Fractal R5 and maybe a 850W psu for a crossfire (2 gpu setup) latter on.Get this one, it's one of the best on the market. Similar ones go for more than \u00a380.

Since you have an all out budget, you should really look into overclocking because a 6700k can usually clock to 4.7ghz (which is pretty crazy on a hyper-threaded quad core cpu.) What is overclocking --&gt; [Link](http://www.howtogeek.com/165064/what-is-overclocking-the-absolute-beginners-guide-to-understanding-how-geeks-speed-up-their-pcs/)

What type of monitor do you have? After you build this, I'd get a nice 1440p monitor.

What i put in this build:

You're lucky because i think that there's two micro centers in Ny. The cpu and Motherboard come as a combo from there at 469.99. You'll save quite a bit of money so make sure you go in store and get it from there.

* I7 6700k. Amazing hyper-threaded cpu, may be bit overkill for your needs but you have the budget for it. 

* The new unlocked Skylake chips don't come with a cooler so you have to buy an aftermarket one. Either get a h100i or a X61 kraken, both of them are good and are going to keep your cpu cool while you overclock.

* Decent motherboard that can SLI (use 2 gpu's).

* Great ssd/hdd combo. Put your OS on the ssd!

* 980ti... it's a 980ti.

* Great quality case that's very quiet.

* One of the best quality power supplies on the market. I put in an 850W so you won't have to buy a new one is you plan to SLI (use 2 gpu's) latter on.

You can still buy this chip and leave it at it's stock speed, it's just never going to go over 45C (that's a good thing). These days you really have to try to damage your parts from overclocking. It's pretty fail safe, if the system isn't getting enough power or it's overheating it'll just shut off and then you try again lol. I would just stick with this chip and in five years from now when it starts to get old you can just overclock it to keep up to the new gpu's. 


TL:DR Just get this chip anyways, you don't have to overclock right away.No problem, that's what we're here for. No kissing necessary. In CDN$ right? And I'll pm, you the build./u/ErisedFoRorrim

If you guys have to money now, don't wait for any type of online sale like Black Friday, Cyber Monday etc.. They'll try to push out their crap products. The only good deal you might find is a ssd/hdd and monitor.Yeah its a pretty sick cooler if you don't want water.You can only get it in store at micro centerThen it's just not posible to make a decent build with an OS under 500 without getting used parts. An overclocked g3258 is still very good in a budget system but if want to step up get a 4170.You won't be really able to utilize the Z motherboard board but it's still a solid build nonetheless.

Parts i Added:

* I tried to fit a 4690k in your budget but that was a no go so i put in a 4460.

* I was able to fit a solid ssd/hdd combo. You could possibly get rid of the ssd and get a better gpu (390 or 970).

* Added a solid 280x.

* Decent quality case with a modular power supply.

* Also added a 1080p monitor with a budget keyboard/mouse combo.

I decided to go with a 6700k, IMO it's still a bit overkill for what you need but if you start rendering then this cpu will be able to keep up with your needs.

Parts i added:

* i7 6700k Hyper-threaded quad core (4 cores, 8 threads)

* Decent budget air cooler. 

* Solid all black motherboard with gold trim.

* Ram is a little expensive but it's all gold and it's going to look awesome.

* Solid ssd/hdd combo (Install your OS on the ssd)

* Added an awesome 390 that will easily max out the games that you listed at 1080p (144fps +).

* Nice windowed case to admire the black and gold build.

* High quality psu to keep you system from blowing up.

* Windows 10.

Now you could make this build cheaper by not going with a black/gold setup but it should look pretty badass.

It's overkill for the games you play, a 390 will easily max out those games, but a 980ti is definitely an awesome gpu and gives you the option to upgrade to 1440p.This build is a bit over your 2k budget, but it's well worth it.

Parts:

* I went with an i7 6700k, it's a hyper-threaded quad core cpu (4 cores / 8 threads) that overclocks really well.

* Good cpu cooler that's sexy as hell.

* solid white/black board that can x-fire.

* 16gb ddr4.

* With this kind of build, you have to have an ssd! lol added a solid ssd/hdd combo.

* Went with a 390 Nitro, it runs the coolest out the 390 family while being able to max out almost every game at 1080p.

* Decent quality case with a window.

* Added a very high quality psu. I went with 850w so you don't have to upgrade it once you decide to x-fire.

Stay on a wired connection!

* Nothing, all parts are very high quality.

Strongest part in this build:

* Cpu- Brand new Skylake chip that should last at least 4 years.

* psu - Should last at least 5 - 7 years.

* gpu - Very good at 1080p. And a 390 x-fire performs well at 1440p.

* Cpu cooler - Almost silent and it can allow for a good overclock.Saying you have an unlimited budget is a dangerous thing lol. If you don't mid spending a bit more, i'd go with a 980ti and a 1440p monitor. But if you don't want to go over $1500, go with a 390 and a 1080p monitor. Either way this build will kick some ass.

Parts:

* Went with an i5 6600k, solid new skylake cpu.

* Good budget cpu cooler.

* Solid motherboard that can SLI/x-fire.

* Good ssd/hdd combo.

* Added a 980ti, it awesome at 1440p.

* Very high quality psu, I went with 850w incase you want to SLI in the future.

* Nice case

* Pretty good IPS 1440p monitor.

There's plenty of room that case for that cooler and a x-fire setup.Yup, an 850 and WD are also a very good choice, just a bit more expensive.I'm assuming you mean a GTX 970? It's a great card but in reality it only has 3.5gb Vram while the 390 has 8gb. In most games at 1080p, 3.5 is usually enough but if you like to play with a lot of mods I'd get the 390.Haha you're friend was probably fooled because it's a h81 motherboard, but this one does support usb 3.0. As for for the slots being weak, I've heard nothing but good things about this board, given that it's a budget motherboard. 

If it still makes you a bit uncomfortable you can go with the MSI, it's pretty much the same price.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-28 17:12 GMT+0000 |I'll point out the problems with that build.

* The main thing is that it's much older architecture. The 4670 is almost 3 years and it's pretty much the price as a 3 month old 6600k that i have in my build.

* Same goes for the z87 vs z170

* ddr3 vs ddr4 doesn't really make a huge difference in a gaming build but it is nice to have the newest stuff (ddr4)

* The 840 evo is one of the worst sdd's out there, as it gets older the performance keeps getting worse and it's more expensive than the newer 850 evo which is considered to be one of the best on the market.

* I can see your reservations about spending $650+ on gpu, but if you want to spend in that price range, go for a R9 390. The 760 is dated and would only be worth around $140.

* Don't get a 1440p monitor unless you can power with a 980ti, a 390 or 970 would be 'ok' with it but you wouldn't be able max out most games and get 60fps. Just get a good quality 1080p monitor.

* you were also missing a cpu cooler, The Haswell cpu come with one but it's generally not a good idea to use them.

Everything else in the build seems to be good, if you want to spend closer to 1.5k, go with something like this.

* Had to put in a 650w psu for the more power hungry 390 and i put in a very good 144hz 1080p monitor,

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-28 18:11 GMT+0000 |Maybe get a h81 board and get a 250gb 850 but besides that, it's a solid build.They're definitely not the most optimal bang/buck builds but in reality they would perform pretty decently at1080p.

I'll give you a couple pointers:

Starting with build #1

* I'd generally avoid the single fan water coolers, they're alright but you could get the same efficiency with a quality air cooler that would be much quieter. If you want water cooling, look at a h100i or x61 Kraken.

* When you're picking a motherboard for a build that has a higher budget, you generally want to get one that can SLI or X-fire (Unless it's a m-itx) if they decide to add another gpu in the future. And since this is a Skylake build you may as well get a motherboard that uses ddr4.

*  You can save some money on a budget if you only go with 8gb's of ram as well. We may need 16 for gaming in the future, but that won't be for a while.

* If you're looking for a gpu in the $200 range, I'd normally recommend a 280x or a r9 380 2gb (if you can get it under $175). Both the 4gb 960 and 380 aren't worth the price and the 2gb 380 usually outperforms the 2gb 960 while the 3gb 280x beats both of them.

* You went way overkill on the power supply, even your build with the 960 sli will only draw 500w at max load so a 600w psu would be sufficient. And at that price you can get an 850w evga G2 which is considered to be one of the highest quality psu's on the market while the 750w RM leaves some to be desired..

Build #2

* Good cpu, motherboard.

* Cpu cooler, see build #1 notes

* ram, see build #1 notes

* I don't recommend SLI'ing weaker cards like 960's. At the cost of those 2 gpu's you could get a 390x, although even a 390x is overpriced, you could overclock a 390 to get almost the same performance.

* The b1 evga's aren't great quality psu's always go for quality over quantity. Here's a decent [psu tier list](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-2547993/psu-tier-list.html). Just take one from tier one or two and do some more research on it.

Hope that help!You have a h97 in that build as well? You can't sli on that either.H81 can't sli, the only reason I recommended it is because you can get one for $40. Then use the money you saved on a larger ssd.OP has a 1k budget, so I'd put a quality 650w GS or G2. This one is alright.

In this build I decided to go with an i5, 980ti and a quality 27" 1440p monitor.

Parts:

* Solid 6600k

* Awesome air cooler that will easily get a 6600k over 4ghz.

* Good motherboard that can SLI.

* 8gb ram, i know you said that you want 16, but there's really no point in having 16 in a gaming build unless you need for certain applications.

* Solid ssd/hdd combo.

* Added a 980ti, awesome gpu for 1440p gaming.

* Added a very high quality 850 G2, normally a 550-600W would suffice for this build but i added the 850 so you can sli in the future.

* Great case with some good sound proofing.

* Very nice 1440p monitor.

* Mx Red Mechanical keyboard.

The i7 2600 was a great cpu in it's day and it's still pretty awesome, but you should try to overclock it a bit. I added a very good budget air cpu cooler so you can try overclocking.

I Also added 380, it usually outperforms a 960.

With you budget But then you would have to get a Haswell cpu.If you're looking for quality, this build will easily get 60 fps on high-max settings in any game at 1080p.

Since you live close to a micro center, you can get a 4590 for cheaper than a 4460.

Parts:

* Added a 4590 from micro center.

* Basic H81 board with usb 3.0 headers.

* 1x8gb ram (standard for gaming, might need 16 in a 2-4 years)

* Good quality hdd

* Awesome 390 that can max nearly every game at 1080p.

* Very good quality psu that will the lifespan of this build.

* Cheap, but good quality case.

* Best wifi adapter on the market (for the money)

* Windows 8.1, you can upgrade to windows 10 for free if you want to.

For the money, I'd stick with that psu,it's pretty good quality.Solid build, Go with this OP. Only thing that i would change is maybe going Skylake but besides that all the parts are pretty good quality.Good Luck!It would probably do a lot better on Battlefront, a friend of mine has a 4170/750ti and he got 30fps on ultra (noAA) and a 270x is quite a bit better.This is a pretty nice upgrade :)

But the motherboards on the other hand offer more features and you can use ddr4 (which won't really make a huge difference in gaming but it's always nice to have the new stuff lol). That monitor has free-sync and you have a 980ti in your build. So OP will be playing games at max 60hz because an NVidia gpu can only G-sync. You may as well swap it for a cheaper 60hz IPS monitor.

OP won't be able to 144 fps with tat build anyway because he won't be able to SLI. (Because the motherboard doesn't support it)

But besides that, it's a pretty good build.OP wants to get into video editing, so I'd swap out the fury for a 980ti so he'll be able to take advantage of cuda cores. If you do that try to find a g-sync monitor to match. Maybe lose the cooler as well. the one that comes with the xeon is quite capable.

Besides that, it's a good build if op really doesn't want to overclockReally not a fan of it, I had a system blow up on it after 2 years. It's made by HEC Compucase and the the GS is made by SeaSonic. The quality just isn't comparable not to mention that the 500b isn't modular in any way.nooooo

* $170 - 380 2gb

* $200 - 280x 3gb

* $250 - 290 4gb

* $300 - 390 8gbIt's definitely not the cheapest nas in the world, but if you don't mind spending a bit more, you could go with something like this:

* G2358 solid low power consumption cpu that can be overclocked to hell

* Very quiet cpu cooler, that one that comes with the cpu is pretty capable but this one is almost silent.

* I had to go with a h97 motherboard so you could get raid support and i couldn't find any that could use m.sata ssd's :/ 

* 2x2gb ram (go 2x2 so it's more fail safe since it's going to be 24/7)

* Cheap regular sized ssd.

* 2tb raid 1 config hdd's

* Nice Fractal m-itx case

* Eco modular psu.

Overall this build is pretty solid, even if it were to run at max load (which would never happen) you would only be pulling under 150 watts.

Different parts used from /u/Isengrine 's build:

* Skylake 6600k

* Z170 motherboard

* ddr4 ram

* Cheaper m.2 ssd

* Cheaper 2tb hdd

* Better 980ti's (IMO)

* I HATE razor so i don't want them on your case lol, added a sound proofed R5.

* Wicked 1440p G-sync monitor.

Just get everything up and running and then start doing some tinkering.The 4gb's aren't worth the price and you can still get by with 2gb. But if you're worried about it you could still get a 3GB 280x for under 200.I'd have to disagree, this isn't a gaming build. A 5820k would perform better than a 6700k.

The dark rock pro 3 keeps up to h100i's  and x61 kraken's  while being much more quiet.

The 950's have 2 dedicated hdmi's and 4 dedicated display ports. 

The drives wouldn't be a bad ideal, I'd just prefer the WD blacks in a raid setup. I just never used Toshiba drives.Yeah I miss worded that lol, you have to turn off sli to use all 6 monitors.I'd go with some like this. It comes up to about $510 befor mail-in's.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-30 08:01 EDT-0400 | You keep getting build that have i7's and if this is a gaming build, an i7 will do absolutely nothing in 99% of games..

Went with a white/black theme with a 980ti sli to drive the hell out of that G-sync monitor for you.

Parts:

* i5 6600k. Solid cpu for a gaming build.

* White/black board that can SLI.

* Good cpu cooler that can get a good overclock on a 6600k. (I know you said that you're probably not going to overclock but you should really look into it especially with a balls to the walls build like this.)

* You don't need 16gb ram in a gaming build, but since this is a high end build i put it in. Also the 3200mhz isn't necessary, I just used it because it looks awesome. You could easily save $70 by going with a 2400mhz 8gb kit.

* Solid ssd/hdd combo. You could go to a 500gb 850 evo if you want.

* 980ti SLI that will be able to reach the 144fps cap on your monitors in almost every game.

* Very high quality 850w G2.

* Personally I find that a full tower is a bit on the larger side, so i put in a good quality white R5. If you really want the full tower go with the Enthoo.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-30 08:37 EDT-0400 |This build is about $750 without the monitor. You should get a 390 so you can max out the 144hz monitor on cs, dota, LoL... It wont get 144fps on newer more demanding games but you'll still be able to max most of them out and get 60fps.
