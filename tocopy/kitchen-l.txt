 Yes 
 I really think Jeff is a bad choice - let's discuss. 
 Read some of Richard's questions 
 We still haven't got this finalized - I'm  looking to do this this week otherwise I would have to start agreeing with Bill that we have to pull them.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Is Smurfitt the deal you lost last Friday? 
 No problem - good luck 
 Kal  Could you please send Cathy a guest user id and password for EnronOnline.  Please set it up with defaults so she can see some products.  Thanks  Louise    Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 Doesn't reflect badly, rather the opposite.  You should also have had a voicemail from John.  See you when you get back.  Let's also talk about your contract when you're back. 
 Apologies Abigail  - sent to you by mistake 
 I was sort of assuming Sally would bring this with her to the meeting. Am I wrong? 
 Good job.  I bet you never thought you would retrade the transport this much. 
 What would be the cost of moving etc - all the new infrastructure etc.  When you say cheaper what do you mean - all in including moving etc.  We obviously have the same issue here but cannot on a cost benefit analysis afford to move. 
 I am expecting an all in cost for this service - what do we achieve in separation.  I had allocated two hours on Friday to do this from 1pm until 3pm.   Are you not intending an all in cost (per transaction) of IT and Operations?  If you believe that the outline below works then go ahead, do we just have the total number debate on Fridy - if so let's start at 2pm.  Thanks  Louise 
 on fuel cells - please set it up and ask Duran  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 terminated as long as we can ie there has been a PIP in place etc but as usual things are slow. She refuses to take a director position - if you ask me she is posturing and will resign for another job shortly - I think she is looking for a payoff.

 We have resolved the issue partly.  John now reports directly to Hunter.  Give me a ring to discuss.  I felt your voicemail needed sorting out - you did sound annoyed, quite rightly so I think we have solved most of the problem.  By the way - give me a date and I'll be in Chicago.

  A.  EnronOnline has been a extremely successful e-Commerce project in the energy industry.  As of September 14, 2001, it has completed over 1.4 million transactions worth $800 billion.  Currently, 60% of Enron's transactions are done via EnronOnline and the company's transaction costs have been reduced by 75%.  Our business model for leveraging the internet has proved invaluable and is inherently strong.  We built EnronOnline in collaboration with input from commercial as well as technological experts.  Over the past 22 months, we have successfully the EnronOnline e-commerce platform to:  1) Access new markets and customers In addition to enhancing its Natural Gas and Power businesses, EnronOnline has enabled Enron to get into other markets, for example, broadband, paper, freight, metals, weather, petrochemicals, and even financial instruments from all over the world.  The system has been instrumental in reaching many more customers than previously possible via telephone or face-to-face meetings.  2) Manage high volume of products and transactions Enron does more than 5,000 online transactions in an average day.  Before EnronOnline, a buyer might have needed to make numerous phone calls to hunt down prices; now s/he can go to EnronOnline and instantly buy or sell a commodity at a market-driven price, with no transaction fee.  The easier price discovery attracts more companies to EnronOnline.  More trading builds liquidity and more liquidity tends to narrow bid and offer spreads, resulting in better prices and more deals for Enron.  To paraphrase Smart Business (September 2001), a long-term gas contract, that in 1981 took two years to execute, and in 1997 took two weeks - now takes less than a second online [thanks in part, to EnronOnline].  Because of the technology and software EnronOnline has developed, it is relatively easy for Enron to add new products to trade online, further making it easier to move into new markets without having to wait for long lead-times required to develop new systems.  3) Improve Competitive Position And Bottom Line  EnronOnline has truly differentiated itself in the industry by using the internet effectively.  The results have been widely reported in the media.  Internet Week (October 2000): "Enron is a company that fundamentally transformed itself on the Internet - having whipped its existing businesses into online ones, ridden the Net into many new markets, added $60 billion in revenue last fiscal year, and has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts in the first two quarters of this year . . . [Enron's] second quarter net income rose 40% from the year-earlier quarter to $404 Million, on 196 percent higher revenue of $50 billion . . . the Internet trading marketplace Enron launched in late 1999 is allowing the company to pounce on market conditions with startling efficiency. EnronOnline now does more than $4 billion a day in trades, in everything from coal and steel to storage services and weather derivatives.  Enron was praised in Smart Business magazine (September 2001) as No. 1 of the "Smart Business Fifty" list for successfully embracing the Net to expand and enhance the business.  Forrester Research (Forrester Report April 2001) predicts online energy trading will explode from a $400 billion market in 2000 (with EnronOnline dominating most of the wholesale energy trades), to $3.6 trillion in 2005.  Enron leads the field with double the online trading volume of its nearest competitor.

 Ok - this isn't dying.  I understand all the usual problems but I am hearing problems with credit turnaround on a continual basis.  West Desk (Foster), Baughman and Vickers have all independently said that the turnaround is incredibly slow.  Slightly different problem from below but this one really sounds legitimate - is it purely staffing?  Can we help?  Louise 
 That's fine - I;m back in tomorrow 
 Aha, could you provide a column including the approver.  Thanks  Louise 
 I thought any 'Contractors' had a zero limit which must be the case.  We have Kathy Abshire buying things and she is a contractor.  Please could you check that contractors and temps have a zero limit. 
 The view is that the CapEx  hold is across the company and your counterpart probably hasn't raised the issue of buying anything with higher management.  Suffice to say our guys have confirmed they don't think the bid is real. 
  Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. Transportation The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. Video You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet). Please find attached the following information: (i) Attendees and Teams for Video (ii) Draft Agenda Any questions or concerns should be addressed to Dorie Hitchcock (Ext 36978) We look forward to seeing you in Beaver Creek. John & Louise

 Yes but no counterparty names.  Jay has it all. 
 Fine by me - I haven't got access to the cash spreadsheet here though. 
 3 & 4 are better than where we are now.  The important thing is you need to get furniture as we currently have lots of rooms empty and they are refusing to give us furniture.  The old building is a really bad idea due to the press etc - when it ends things will be easier.  But currently moral would be ahuge issue moving to the old building. 
 Really you need to do it.  Pack everything apart from the ESVL files and SEC subpeona stuff.  Pack on ly what is in the hanging files in the cupboards and my drawers.  Anything outside of a hanging file leave for later.  I would prefer you to do it as it needs indexing.  STuff in my office hanging files goes to Don Miller and the rest goes to ? (ask legal).  Leave binders,etc for now.  Did you get rid of the deal momentoes (4 boxes).  Tell them they can get me on my mobiles - no problem.  Liz can cover - have a great time.  Pick up your tickets early in the day. 
 As per yesterday's governance schedule we will have a weekly one but for now I would suggest one on one with Eber as it has be3en the only succesful route3 to date.  Can you give him a ring with Steffes today and get this stuff moving.  Thanks 
 Can you make sure Marcus Nettelton has three screens.  One pc and two screens.  Thanks  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Simply  People, systems and floor space.  Back to front applications with no specific counterparty data.  WE have historical pricing etc but no counterparty names.  You could get most of it from Reuters. 
 Tammie - forward this message to Calger and Milly and Forster  Hello  I am really concerned over the lack of approvals from UBS of our contract formats as even when  we get them we have to still populate with the specific credit terms and then get them out into the market place.  I am really getting worried on timing.  Could you guys get together and see if you can push forward on this today.  Try rining Dinerstien and explain the urgency. I did mention to Hutchins and Costas that this is my main concern last week.  So we should involve Greg if you can't get anywhere.  Thanks  Louise 
 Give Chris Calger a ring if you are serious.  I hope you're not. 
 Agreed 
 I think there are issues with this as essentially we are changing the business model - we need to hire into the areas we are lacking people asap in order to ensure we have coverage as much as possible.  Will your people mopve to Houston? 
 I am confused - in terms of the options exercised - we covered those in last year's tax return which unforttuantely I do not have a copy of here.   I am concerned I am double paying tax on these.  Can  you check last years's US tax return which covered those options.  I am contatable on 07778757656.  Thanks  Louise 
 Don't worry - you're not supposed to let go while I'm away.  Speak to you later  Cell number 713 530 0838 or 011447778757656 
 Tammie    Please could you set up the meetings (apart from the Thursday one which UBS already has arranged.  Contact Dave Forster and co-ordinate with him.  I couldn't forward you the email I sent but it was just to the 8 commercial MDs in UBSWEnergy.  Can you sende the attachment to all of the people (ex Enron only) on the lists (see in attachment) and copy to Par Odonnell and Mark Bridges - Dave Forster has their emails.  Thanks  Louise 
 Please find attached the governance schedule for UBSW Energy.  Tammie will co-ordinate dial ins etc 
 Agreed - sorry I had thought Lavo sorted this out.  As we understand, Caroline wants to work in Manhattan and therefore we need to look at those offices.  Tammy Shepperd is the person to contact.  Tammy can you please sort out Caroline - same issues as Mike McDonald but New York. 
 Big - a whole floor with no pillars.  Got to be the most expensive place in the world to live. 
 We'll see you at about 4pm is that ok?  On cell 07778757656 - flying tonight. 
 Oxley - shouldn't think its a problem I mentioned it on Friday.  David please sort out - if there is difficulty contact Pat 
 Love it

 Prepays - although they do not terminate they do drop to zero collateral on a further downgrade. 
 2. Cancel  Thanks  PRC is something we should do all in one day.  I'll let you know. Working on Peoples inventory or cash from anywhere helps. 
 What is the number?  I am very worried that you are sending a negative message on Enron out of the building. 
 It may tie but what is the difference - I think the uneven margining in Mahonia 9 is costing us a lot.  I'm not worried about the actual number just the imbalance in margin which hasn;'t come back to us 
 Ray  Essentially they are fishing its not a really good time for them to come in (but when is).  Its a reassurance meeting please help if you can.  Joe Bob Perkins did a lot of damage in the market to us initially (one month ago) so assume everything you say get's made public.  The fact we are doing 3500 trades a day still is a thing you can tell him.  Thanks  :Louise 
 Let's get on  it really seriously tomorrow.  We should have at least started AEP's notice period with your note today.  Did we send margin letters on others today as we need to.  Louise

 Not going well 
 Please update daily 
 I need a two bedroom 
 Seems like something which takes time to implement particularly as we do not have margin contracts with our counterparty - this changes the function of EnronOnline to a margin exchange mechanism.  Long run not a short term solution.

 Enron Management Committee  I hereby resign from the above mentioned committee. 
 Below is the draft of our governance which I think works.  Let me know your thoughts and possibly we can discuss at this morning's meeting.  I will be participating by phone from the airport as I am on my way to Stamford.   As we move forward we have two huge tasks to complete at the same time, the integration with UBS Warburg and the re-start of our business.    The UBS corporate governance facilitates the creation of several committees which will meet on a regular basis to resolve issues and report on progress.  Within the UBS framework we will be creating a 'Transitional Steering Committee',  'Integration Committee' and 'Gas and Power Operating Committee'.  UBS has already created the Integration Committee which we will merge into.  Dave Forster will be attending all of these groups in the early weeks to ensure consistency and good communication.  Dave will also act as our point person for Mark Bridges from UBS, ensuring the simplest and most effective methods of communication are in place for both parties.  This email outlines the governance structure that will be formalized with immediate effect:  1.	Transitional Steering Committee: This committee will be responsible for the overall management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002. Committee Members: Mike Hutchins (co-chair) Greg Whalley (co-chair) Louise Kitchen Pat O'Donnell Mike Bolin Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis until shortly after the Launch Date, and then bi-monthly thereafter until December 31 2002. Minutes will be distributed to senior UBS and Enron management only. Proposed Time	- Wednesday 8:30am CST  2.	Integration Committee: This committee will be responsible for the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the integration efforts for both the initial Launch Date and the later Disentanglement Date at the end of 2002.  Any issues, which this committee cannot resolve, will be escalated to the Transitional Steering Committee.  Proposed UBS Energy Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Pat O'Donnell (co-chair) Mark Bridges Sally Beck  - Operations Mark Haedicke - Legal Wes Colwell - Financial Operations Bill Bradford - Credit David Port - Market Risk Jay Webb - IT Jenny Rub - Infrastructure Peter Keohane - Canada David Forster - ubswenergy.com UBS counterparties Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis until reviewed at December 31 2002. Minutes will be distributed to the Transitional Steering Committee and team members as appropriate. Time - Thursday 9:00am CST  3. 	Gas and Power Operating Committee: This committee will be responsible for the operational running of the Gas and Power Trading business.   The initial focus of this group will be the re-starting of the business. Following the relaunch the purpose of the Management Committees will be to push through its strategic plans and targets globally, to be able to react to market changes quickly, and provide a forum for communication across all locations.  These committees should also maintain, and develop further, any synergies between the Gas and Power Business and other UBS businesses.  Proposed Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Greg Whalley (co-chair) Tim Belden Chris Calger John Lavorato Kevin Presto Hunter Shively Rob Milnthorp Plus ad hoc members of the Logistical support functions as and when required. ?Proposed Logistics: This committee will meet on a weekly basis but not before March 2002.  Prior to March 2002, this committee will be replaced by two sub-committees - the Operational Re-start Sub-Committee and the Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee.  3(i)		Operational Restart Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the support functinality is full available at the restart date.  Proposed Sub-Committee Members: Louise Kitchen (co-chair) Pat O'Donnell (co-chair) Mike Bridges Sally Beck  - Operations Mark Haedicke - Legal Wes Colwell - Financial Operations Bill Bradford - Credit David Port - Market Risk Jay Webb - IT Jenny Rub - Infrastructure Peter Keohane - Canada David Forster - ubswenergy.com Proposed Logistics: This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded. Time Tuesday 8:00am CST  3(ii)	Commercial Re-start Sub-Committee This subcommittee will be responsible for ensuring that the UBS Warburg Energy Counterparties are capable of transacting with our new company in the shortest time possible and in the most efficient way for both the counterparty and UBS Warburg Energy.  Proposed Sub-Committee Members: Louise Kitchen Bryan Murtaugh - UBS Legal Mark Taylor Elizabeth Sager/Leslie Hansen Mary Cook/Jeff Hodge Bill Glass Bill Bradford Peter Keohane Barry Tycholiz Frank Vickers Laura Luce Rob Milnthorp Chris Calger David Forster Other members to be announced Proposed Logistics: This sub-committee will meet weekly until disbanded. Time Tuesday 10:00am CST  Tammie will notify each of you of the rooms etc.

 Still here - no idea what the Standard Power offer is - so probably not going to help but there are signs of hope for gas and power trading.  Unbelievable that a trading shop was brought down by rogue traders. 
 I meant rogue finance guys!! 
 You need to stay - I am trying to get us sold. 
    The same here now 
 Thanks for the note.  We are really trying very hard to keep the trading and marketing organisation in North American gas and power together with a view to selling it.  We have a lot of interest at the moment so I have my fingers crossed. Everyone is still here and to be honest I'm proud of the fact they are holding on still to see if we can compete the sale.  Here's a little fact - two years to the day of launch I turned EnronOnline off worldwide when it was in full swing, it was actually just when we had the downgrade announcement.  I think it will be back though.  I think I am still in shock that a rogue finance group and some bad investments brought down a trading shop.  That must be first.  If all else fails - I'll ring you on how to get my book published.  Take care & I will keep in touch.  Louise 
 Have them delivered to Jim Derrick and explain that they are Fastow's deal mementoes which were left in his office. I don't think his picture will have reference so we'll keep it for now. Thanks   Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 I left you on Portland for now but obviously when we announce the strucutre it will change.  Duran does know though. 
 We do need a list tomorrow morning.  I am still in meetings.  Is is possible to email me questions.

 This got to me tonight - If we come back, or when we come back we need to remember this guy.  I have no idea who he is but please can we hire him back if/when we get EnronOnline back on top.  We need to remember him next year.  A great reflection on you guys too.  Louise   Ref: Houston Chronicle website * * * * * Tuesday, Dec. 4 I was part of the greatest team I have ever seen or heard of. We had unmatched talent and skill. We had a seemingly bottomless pool of experience to draw upon. We consistently diplayed unyielding determination and unwavering resolve. But, above all, an unbreakable commitment to help make Enron Online great. Throughout the decline we did what we had always done -- we did our best. * * * * *  "Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office. ... They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too."  Matt Hommel,  former Enron employee * * * * * We have all read the news and we all know the things that happened at Enron and we all know the names of those to blame. At the end of it all, the truth is that bad things happen. For myself I humbly asked for only one thing: The chance to rebuild Enron Online. I waited all day praying that I would get a call to tell me that my wish had been granted. Around 9 p.m. I got the call from the senior director that I hoped was good news. In the utmost professional manner, I was informed that there was no good news. Now it's over. I still get a bit choked up when I think about it. I don't work at Enron, and the team that I was a part of has been scattered in the streets. I made some good friends at Enron, but I know I won't see many of them again. Enron took those friendships, Enron took my 401(k), they took my stock options, they took away the day-old pastries that were always on the desk outside my office, they took the free sodas and the big screen TVs and the foosball table. They took away the free dinners we got on Friday nights during the new releases to the Web site. They took away the admin who always teased me because I ate like a pig and never gained weight. They took away the guy that beat me in foosball 5-1, despite the fact that he played with one hand and was carrying on a conversation on his cell phone while he played. They took away my boss and my co-workers, whom I considered a family. I loved my job, and in the end they took that, too. But let me say this. I have my memories. I am not going to ruin them with feelings of resentment or betrayal. I am going to keep my memories. They belong to me.

 In the interests of full communication - here's an email I sent to EOL.  It's only a comment not a direction for Jay or anything - but it was a pretty sad read for me. 
 you are been estalked! 
 Any time tomorrow morning possible? 
 Give me a ring when you are on your way. 
 Thanks for working on this - I appreciate it.  Louise 
 I did 
 Let's get some time tomorrow.  Essentially although there is still a long way to go and nothing is certain,  Greg has decided that Rick will run a group including Market Risk, Credit Risk and Research.  Things are too early to know whether you will report in only in that way or also directly through their credit departments which was certainly a preference of one or two of the bidders.  Let's discuss more, I do have some other details for you too. 
 Shouldn't we have let this group go?  Why are we retaining them?

 I would like to discuss a change of management for EnronOnline under the Netco scenario.  I believe that we have a very short period of time to get EnronOnlne back up and running and with this in mind it may be preferable to change out the management sooner rather than later.  I think there is a lot of preparation work which can be done now.  Can we discuss?  Thanks 
 I can send you people.  Jay Webb and Jenny Rub can do the rest.

 Ohoh  its all gone to ratshit! 
 What does that mean? 
 Firstly,  I never pick up voicemail so I just got your message from the week-end.  Sorry.  Anyway EnronOnline:  There are two versions today - we keep one in NewCo and the Estate keeps one.  Two teams can be allocated for each. It works - we have enough people to do it.  In terms of the Estate: The Estate will keep a copy of the source code and the Estate will also maintain a staff on both the development side and the support side in order to ensure the service can be maintained.  The source code and build process are sufficient to allow for running almost immediately.  We actually have two EnronOnline environments today - the 'staging environment' and the real 'production environment'.  Essentially we would leave the staging environment for Enron - it is simply a question of staffing which I believe is totally possible now we have allocated the staff to NewCo and the Enron estate.  In terms of NewCo: EnronOnline will be maintained for NewCo using the production environment.  With its own staff.

 Dear Linda  I apologize for not having responded earlier but I do not think I received the invitation, which is quite possible bearing in mind the difficulties here at the moment.  We have recently received approval from the bankruptcy judge to sell the portion of the business I jointly manage to UBS Warburg and in fact I am planning to relaunch enrononline (under our new entity) and we hope to be up and running around the time you are in Germany.  I am sure you understand that it is going to be a busy time for me in February combining the integration with UBS and restarting the gas and power trading operation under our new owner.  I appreciate your comments and thank you for your invitation but I do not feel able to accept.  I hope you all have a safe and enjoyable trip to Germany.  Regards  Louise Kitchen

 Message understood - we will try and accomodate Derek  Have a good week-end. 
  We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.  Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.  Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.  The meeting will be in John's office.  Thanks  Louise

 Just a couple of suggested changes to both.  There is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership structure of the entity.  Enron had previously announced that the entiy would be 51% New Owner and 49% Enron.  We need to ensure this message is corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100% UBS owner.   On the release for UBSWenergy.com - we do intend to trade physical gas and power immediately initially at least in the areas we can, so I have removed that sentence.  Do you need all of the commercial  MD titles or is Kevin picked out for a particular reason?  Thanks  Louise

 Excellent 
 Good news - let's focus on getting the data this afternoon when we know the winner. 
 This amused me this morning!  Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"  The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing sheep and replies, "Okay."  The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,  "You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."  The shepherd answers,  "That's correct, you can have your sheep."  The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The shepherd looks at him and asks,  "If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man answers, "Yes, why not?"  The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."  "How did you know?" asks the young man.  "Very simple," answers the shepherd.  "First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?" 
 Can we have them until we move?  That would probably be the easiest time to give them up. -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld

 Current costs.  In these plans we have expensed software and hardware which we will probably amortize.  Gets us around the $200mm mark. 
 50% or less of the current group.   We have a market of 1 year = $x, so we'll need more cash for less people.   We may need our spare cash to fund the $12mm for the back office etc. 
  A bit of light entertainment!!     (See attached file: DoubleTree Show.ppt)     - DoubleTree Show.ppt

 How is it going -------------------------- Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld 
 Its the old NGL group.  I presume propane, butane etc 
  Expensed them. 
 Arnold picked this group up from EGM because he said they were profitable and would be a good source of income.  My recommendation is to drop them as we have no systems, lawyers, credit capacity to manage them.  Unless I hear otherwise they will be gone. 
 I just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today.  I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.  Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.  The commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers.  Thanks for your late and long hours.  Louise 
 issue 
  No  No 
 Any clue on numbers yet?  Top's support people are ringing our guys and telling them they want more people (legal)!  Bit of an issue when we'll be cutting.

 Fine by me.  The site will go live this week-end in preparation for Monday morning. 
 No and no assurance should be given.

 Please get this printed - it is not formatted at the moment

 Ok great thanks

 Just to clear up a mis-understsanding.  Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.  In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which Jenny assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.  Thanks  Louise 
 Apart from the practicalities - Only Enron Canada and Enron Australia have the right to trade in the North American markets.  Australia is in bankruptcy and therefore in default of the cost sharing agreement - so we assume that's dead.  ECC is in the deal and selling its rights.   So as far as the exclusive for North America Gas and Power we are OK.  The practical issues are still huge but I thought I'd tell you this.  No-one has rung me yet.

 Issue keeps coming up - Disaster Recovery There is no number in our budget for Disaster Recovery either space or systems - big expense. 
 Recognize the truck????? 
 Pat  For your information, I have attached the current proformas (UBS and the standard).  I know John and Mike have had a lot of conversations on this - essentially where we stand is that the work has been done to complete the commercial reductions (by name) but the non-commercial groups have just been reduced across the board and we intend to start the process today on how to cut the numbers on the non-commercial side.  The theory was that communicating the Netcolite concept was something we would not do until we had a bit more clarity.  Webb knows but that's about it on the non-commercial side.  Hope this helps.

 What's your address? 
 Solarc is the system used for NGLs etc - we do not plan to convey it into NetCo.    In terms of the court case - the whole thing is stayed pending the bankruptcy.  They did try and prevent the whole NetCo thing but there is obviously no basis for any suit as we are not taking it. 
 Absolutely - thanks 
 Its an IT security issue - ask Jenny or Bob what they think the plans are - it would be better if we were near peole. 
 I had presumed it got transferred - Wes could you please sort. 
 I sent you all your birthday stuff a day earlier just in case we lose our email for a day if it is taken down to be cleared.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Anne  We need these for Netco - is it too late? 
 Don't know!!! 
 It is going to be really difficult to do the split, eg the EnronOnline patent is moving, can we take all of the history of  concerning that which is on drives etc 
 Unless I am mistaken the estate is a part of this new deal, does this mean we can do without this.

 Where does this patent reside - in the Estate or NetCo? 
 I was envisaging something like the one talked about for Canada which is cancellable by the estate at any time.  Netco theoretically should be able to help the estate harvest the value in Feb and March where the majority of the value is for this contract. 
   Where do we get the headcount room from? 
 Bob  Superb  Would you mind adding responsibility names to each.  Thanks  Louise

 Needs Duran alteration 
 Harry/Jay, can you help come to some conclusion on this. 
 Hello, glad to hear you are well.  This all depends on who owns the domain name.  If it is Enron Europe we need to forward all inquiries to Price Waterhouse - this is important as Enron Europe is no longer part of Enron and the administrator has all legal claim to the name.  I have no idea what happened to the sale of EnronDirect and who now owns it.  I would suggest ringing London and asking to talk to someone from Price Waterhouse managing Enron Direct.  Take care  Louise

 Following is a brief description of the EnronOnline contractual framework and copies of the proposed ETA and PA, which have been revised from the initial EnronOnline versions to reflect experience of the last two years.  Hopefully this will assist the meeting on Monday morning.  Contracts Structure  There are three key documents that create the contractual environment for NetcoOnline: the 'Password Application' (PA), the 'Electronic Trading Agreement' (ETA) and the commodity contracts in the form of 'General Terms and Conditions' (GTCs) (or, alternatively, a Master Agreement). The PA is the only document which needs a written signature from the customer. The other documents are accepted online.   PassWord Application (PA)  The PA is a one-page document and is the only document that has to be physically signed by the counterparty (as opposed to any of the other documents, which are accepted online by clicking acceptance). The PA is the document by which the customer agrees to be bound by the terms of the ETA and the GTCs.  The PA, signed by an authorized person in the counterparty company, and approved by Netco, allows the customer to obtain a Master User ID. The Master User will be able to set up all traders and administrative users within his/her company and administer their access to various products in NetcoOnline.  We will send copies of the PA to likely customers of NetCoOnline before we launch the site. The document will also be available to be printed from the website after we launch. Customers will specify their Initial Password in the PA and must change it in the first log-in session. Upon receipt of signed PA, Netco will under normal circumstances enable the Master User Passwords within 24 hours for pre-approved customers. For counterparties with whom we are not familiar, more time is needed to run credit, legal, contracts, regulatory and tax check.   Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)  The ETA binds counterparties to completed transactions through NetcoOnline. When the counterparty accesses NetcoOnline for the first time, he/she will be prompted to read and accept the ETA in order to proceed. The ETA states that all trades done via NetcoOnline will be governed by the General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) posted online for a particular product, unless there is a Master or any other Agreement between Netco and the counterparty in place.   General Terms and Conditions (GTC)  To be sent when the Buyer is known. When a customer offers to transact in a Product type for the first time, he/she will be presented with the relevant GTC. The GTC's are similar to a streamlined Master Agreement, in that they provide the general contractual framework for multiple transactions in a given commodity. GTC's identify termination rights, provisions for security (as appropriate), operational conventions (nominations, etc.), payment periods, tax treatments, force majeure, penalties for non-performance, etc.  Customers must accept the terms of the relevant GTC online in order to proceed with a transaction, unless the company has a Master Agreement in place with Netco. Only one acceptance of GTC per Product Type per company is required. If there is a valid Master Agreement, then the system will not display the GTC, and the Master Agreement will apply.

 no issues - please contact 
 EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very little left to carve out. 
 Yes - I think Tycholiz sees less value but definitely worth a look 
 Handouts please  Thanks 
 Diary - I will not attend but remind me 
 approved 
  we need a big party organizing for everyone - please sort.  Thanks 
 The gas contracts we need include the following, can you give us timescales. I understand that we have had issues getting these together and time is now running out.  Mark, I believe, has put you in charge or gas -please could you give us a timescale.

 I believe so  Fine 
 I take it you are not going to decommission my louise@enron.com as it is the one I have on all business cards and all our potential buyers are using it. 
 Shall we toss for who rings back?  Its going to be a long conversastion. 
 This is our initial proposal.  Please feel free to contact Bill. 
 Today, the Euros are coming and John is going to be running this negotiation - here's the bad news they are not coming until 3:30pm today so we may have to work late.  Barry Tycholiz will be running this team. Barry - talk to Andy on form if you need help - you will also need to think about getting some traders available over week-end.  The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:  It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  4:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen 4:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell 5:15		Risk Overview			Buy / Port 5:45		Credit				Bradford 6:15		Back Office			Beck/Hall 6:45		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb 7:15	            Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb Infrastructure			Jenny Rub   Please make yourselves available - the meetings will take place in 2991  Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc on John's card.  Tammie - please check availability.  Thanks for your continued understanding.  Louise

 I am assuming one of you comes initially - you or Bob.  We don't mind someone coming later but do need someone in at the beginning.  What do you think?

 No problem  Thanks 
 Did you do anything to it - I can't see. 
 The only contracts out before a bidder is awarded are the PA and ETA.  Essentially the set up agreements for online trading.  The PA is one page and the ETA several.  These are standard and not long.  Let's discuss tomorrow. 
 We will be joining post another meeting so probably will not have time to get back to our offices.  Please feel free to phone in from whereever you like. 
 Rick, The list below is our Top 50 counterparty list.  We intend to send our suggested credit headrooms tomorrow morning.

 Can you do on gas and power together. 
 The lawyers have come back and ask if you are including any of your global counterparty or contract admin.  Have we covered this function?  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 I think its the same again - can you come over for it 
 I had a conversation with Richard Stuckey at Citi and he is still struggling with how to do teh EES carve out.  Can I make the following suggestion. 
 Top 50 counterparties - can you send me the list?  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Duran removed him - why was he not originally included? 
 What happened to Don's salary?  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 I do not understand the Netco/Newco comments.  Clearly at this point Enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer.  That would be a Don Miller/Fallon final call - but I think its a no brainer. 
 I have asked one of our deal team lawyers to send you a copy of the document. Her name is Anne Koehler.  Regards  Louise  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Pat - please pass to the appropriate person - thanks   I thought it may be helpful to introduce Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  The attached document is a high level outline of what needs to be done between ourselves and the buyer.  Should UBS be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name "ubsenergy.com".  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know.  If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact Dave or myself, or on the form of the agreements Mark Taylor.

 Contracts cannot be assigned - its that simple.  They have to be offered ou= t to market under an auction like structure just like everything else.  All agreements remain with the Estate and will be managed by the estate.  I will check with Canada on their status but I presume its the same. 
 Seems Marla is the contact. 
 East Desk???? 
 I definitely had a black mat last time.  I would like a black mat again.  In reality this is a picture for a friend so I will copy to her and she can order it directly based on the fact that it doesn't look like I got any discount for being a returning customer.  So Ellie, this is what you want with a black mat.  MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald   $1030.00  ($936.36 ex GST  for o/seas orders) FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST) Freight $250.00  Fay, please co-ordinate with Ellie.  Thanks for your help  Louise 
 It's long but good.    http://www.oddtodd.com 
 Barry is in Accounting for now, Jim wants him for the estate.  All of that was before you were in.  I had to plan.  I think Barry is an asset - Wes and I don't know where though.  Any thoughts? 
 No - please carry on.  UBS meeting went OK 
 I'll sort 
 It was someone for David 
 I needed the full list tonight - is this all I get.  We are assuming all pipes that we trade today. 
 Is it coming back?  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 But what is her status now? 
 HR gave the list to me - I hope they are still getting paid 
  It might help if I told you the shipping address!  Houston, Texas, USA 
 I would like the Solitude, MT,USA photo. Mounted but not framed. Black mount. 60 inches. I would like in exactly the same format as the one you sent me last Christmas of Field of Rainbows.  If you still have that one on record.  Do I get a discount as a returning customer?  What is the delivered price (including Fedex).  Thanks  Louise Kitchen  aka Louise Nettelton 
 Thanks 
 The following people have been identified as no longer with the company although they are on the Netco list.  Please let Kari know on any changes (Jeanie is out).  I assume there are no problems but if so let me know.  Larry Hunter	- Documentation Deidre McCaffrey - Gas Origination Larry Cash - Gas Settlements Jon Lewis - Risk 
 Is Barry Pearce in the list?  See below for alterations 
 Jim Steffes will be contacting UBS through you.  I did Citigroup (hope that's OK). 
 Does seem a bit of an issue - who is in charge of this?  Robert? 
 Shawn  We have had a lot of discussion on the contractual arrangements we would need to put in place in order to recommence trading as quickly as possible.  I am working on producing a fuller list for you today.  However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC.  In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future.  Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate)  Present - January 10th, 2002        Complete filing documentation January 11th                                Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer) January 13th                                 File and request an expedited process  It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.  Thanks  Louise 
 Yes - all enabling agreements need to be included 
 No master on EOL.  GTC. 
 FYI 
 No  The Weather group is the Meterologists and the Crude group are the original Fred Lagrasta marketers who were spun off under Randy Maffett - they will be brought back into the fold for gas marketing.  So we don't need mid/back office support. 
 I'm so sorry - hope things go ok

 Tammie - please set up a meeting with Chris (he needs to be in a room in Portland for confidentiality) as soon as possible this morning - hopefully before or not long after the 9:30 (portland time power meeting)  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 No I did mean Duran - he told me he had a whole group of people we could bring in and he knew at what cost. 
 Cool - we are ready.

  No - this is a serious problem  FERC is just a month and probably will be expediated to less than that.  I want all the transmission and pool agreements to start much earlier - what is the problem with starting the negotiation now.  We really cannot accept these timescales - we have always assumed one month and all of this stuff is in place.  I'll be on the phone call  - let me know times/numbers  Tammie - get Liz Sager to attend

 I copied this email list and copied Rita Wynne, Stacey White by mistake which obviously I shouldn't have done. 
 No real choice - apparently there was an issue with visas so Jay told them they could say no.  Let's revisit Wednesday. 
 The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.  The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-  (i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible. The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002. (ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building. I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002. (iv)	Due Diligence We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.  I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.  Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.  If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.  Happy New Year  Louise 
 On Wednesday morning we will be commencing the Due Diligence process with another counterparty.  Andy Zipper has agreed to lead their team through the process.  The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:  It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  9:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen 9:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell 10:30		Risk Overview			Buy / Port 11:00		Credit				Bradford 11:30		Back Office			Beck/Hall 12:30		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb 1pm		Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb 1:30pm		Infrastructure			Jenny Rub 2:00pm		HR				Oxley  Please make yourselves available - the meetings will probably take place on 32.  Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc.  Assume Big Pig will bring 8 people.   Thanks   Louise 
 Happy New Year by the way. 
 Great - no changes

 Ring each of the people on the list to make sure they know they have to produce the plan below by the end of the week.  Let me know who you have problems contacting. 
 Just when you thought it was safe............................  We need to start working on getting everyone together who is in Netco in time for the sale of the company.  The ideal move time would be either this week-end or the next.  The idea is that everyone (856) resides on 5 and 6 in the new building.  HR has the most up to date list of who all of the people are.  But essentially the organisation is just a smaller version of what we have today.  All commercial people on 6, non-commerical on 5.  We would need to plan for an office to be created in the room next to mine (but hold off on implementing that piece).  As the credit group is already here (in the room next to mine) - it would be really good to move them first so they do not have to move back to the old building and then back.  Thanks 
 We just need people to give us a week.  Surely they'll give us that long.  How are the new designs coming?  Did you and Avril have a nice Christmas - I am trying to reconnect my UK cell phone - I have been on the phone for 1 and half hours. 
 Firstly, Dave is not responsible for the initial creation of these numbers which was done by Brad Richter before Dave joined the group.  I presume it was based on Brad's evaluations.  I suggest we wait another week to see the structure of the transaction before moving numbers.

 Oh oh - I suppose it all went to the other Bob.  I thought you were Robert L Hall Jr 
 We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-  +	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub +	Development		Jay Webb +	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster +	HR			David Oxley +	Cash Management	Tom Myers +	Credit			Debbie Brackett  The rest will be completed shortly.  We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.  Customer Side +	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) +	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers Phase  2 Customers Phase  3 Customers +	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) +	Customer visit schedule  Product Side +	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week Phase 2 - First Month Phase 3 - First Quarter  Target Number of Transactions +	Phase 1 +	Phase 2 +	Phase 3  IT transfer  Louise

 So I never got paid (expenses) for my tickets home.  Surprize!!!!!  So if I cancel - obviously as I didn't go.  Can I then reclaim the economy ones I booked for my parents and brother instead as I did not take my 2001 entitlement.  The tickets were all economy (4 x $1374:74).  A lot cheaper still than three business seats.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 As I never used them - when do they get refunded - we then need to net off on expenses and reclaim the family ones.    Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.  I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.  This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.  Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:  11/13/01	4,069:72 11/10/01	21,010:15 11/10/01	3,319:40  Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.  In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.  In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.  Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow. 
 Let's discuss Thanks  Louise

 I have already registered several domaine names in the interest of getting up and running as soon as possible post sale of the business.  I have experience of delays as we have tried to retrieve domaine names where people have squatted intentionally in order to extract large sums of cash.  Should any of the buyers raise any issues - I do intend to use these for the purposes of our new business. I have a lot of them - spurious and real.  Louise 
     Tammie  They know you are picking up the tickets - you will need a photo id too. You need to be in your seats 30 minutes before the show - get a cocktail to take in - I recommend the 'O'.

 Not quite sure where we ended up on this lot but clearly some of the below are Enron Europe's, so we do not need to bother with them. 
 Sorry its all prepetition.  I already claimed the flights, now I will not be using them as I can not go home.  I am using the money to pay for my parents's flights although not all of the money will be used.  The rest of the money I intend to offset against expense checks which bounced.    Should there be an imbalance - I will sort this out with Enron once payments have been completed on expense checks.  OK? 
 I take it I do not need to do this? 
 I read Anne's document - does that not work?  What is John Casaucoumeq's title? 
 As you know I have Business Flights home each year under my contract.  As I will be unable to travel to the UK due to the requirement to be in Houston over the holidays I intend to use them for my parents, borther and sister-in-law.  Any difference in the cost I intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether Enron intends to meet expense payments.

 finally read it - I thought it was pretty crappy.  I am spending all my days in credit.  Head above water but only just. 
 It never rains when it pours! 
 Do the innocuouss route and send them a letter stating you will change it at the next available/scheduled GTC change would be my suggestion.  Also just to confirm no GTC  changes on anything for the near future.  Thanks  Louise 
 Attachment shows where we ended up.  I really don't think it helps if we have customers read only on EOL. How does that hurt us?  It certainly helps them - I think you have a publicity nightmare too . We should probably talk but I am more of the opinion we'll take anyone's credit now and risk reducing helps them to keep trading potentially.   AEP sent us a very threatening letter.  Way outside of their contractual rights. 
 sorry missing the message  When are the payments and how much are they if we keep moving forward as I am not prepared to write down a 23mm loss.  Payments and payment dates please.  Thanks  Louise  Please say not soon too.

 Canada appears to be an issue.  We need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.  With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue.  There are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers.  Please let me know how we can progress on this.  Louise 
 You are officially my favourite people 
 It is evident that our customers continue to view Enron as a major liquidity provider in global energy markets.  Change 1,399 users to 1,399 counterparties.

 I can bring back probably $45-50mm on Friday, by switching to Paribas.  Maybe more, Shankman is working on his margin too. On Peoples -I'll get back to you tomorrow. 
 Thanks for your swift assistance. 
 fine 
 We recognize that we are experiencing a difficult time at Enron now and you are all interfacing with our customers every day.  We are therefore holding a  short meeting at 9:00am tomorrow morning to answer questions from you and your groups.  Tammie to advise on the room.  Please invite all of your groups.  Louise 
 LEt me know if you are planning any of these. 
 I spoke to Chris on this today, we are covering Foster but not going to do anything on the others at this time.  We can review in another month or so. 
 Here's what I have so far (who are we supposed to tell about this??)  (i)	Broker Margins Approx:	 $50mm Availability:	 End of Week Probability:	 85% Current position (initial margin) $60mm out.  John Arnold will tomorrow bring a large portion of this back by moving positions to our Paribas credit line (we have a $75mm line 	which we are only using $15mm of).  I am working on the rest, which is spread across various other EGM books.  (ii)	Peoples JV Approx:	$135mm Availability:	Within month Probability:	50% We have (i) $10mm in the enovate bank account ($20mm in total, 50:50 Enron Peoples), (ii) $40mm storage inventory and (iii) $75mm in a pre-pay.  (iii) 	Emmissions Reductions Credits (held by West Power). Approx:	$25.5mm Availability:	Dependent on whether financing Probability:	50% If the vehicle is rolled, then we could look to use the additional capacity.  The vehicle will be rolled next week.  (iv)	Mariner - Zero ($2mm in bank)  Deffner's group working on EGM's $400mm and Joe Gold is ready to go with his $300mm.  So that's good, we should be able to get some of this off. 
 no 
 WE need to put them in.  Ring me. 
 Don't we need the heads of all the power origination groups too 
 yup 
  Working Ya (as Shankman would say).  It appears they will offer guarantees but I am awaiting confirmation. 
 Does this still have capacity?  Can I put the West Desk's ERCs in this vehicle? How quickly?  How much capacity is left? Respond when you can. 
 Sorry I completely forgot it was Wednesday

  Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:  Producer/Wellhead Group The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.  Strategic Asset  Development Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.  Central Origination and Mid-Market Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region.   There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond.  Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.  Louise & John 
 I think the job may still be open next year. 
 We are going to ask Kim's group to help pull information for credit (public domaine information) in order to help accelerate the credit process as his group is heavily stretched at the moment.

 John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. John was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mark address tis together.

 Hello  Glad you got yourself sorted with a new job.  Things here are getting better - we have nearly closed with UBS, so I hope to have a new job next week.  Still in Houston.  Are you trading - if so what?  Take care  Louise 
 Don't tell me - did you tell his nibs - it's his issue 
 We're getting them back believe it or not!!!  They are ours again.  So its ok.  We got the merchant business back a week, we don't even know who made that decision but its our again. 
 When people request an understanding of gas or power - does this mean you ask people from ENA to give tours or speak or something?  Is there any role we play in hosting the event? 
 This one is searching through expoense reports.  I have no interest.  Can you guys do this for John please. 
 That is awful.  Poor little kid.  Do they think it was just another child?

So I know this chap MS who won't move to Portland but its worht you talking to him.  Should you decide to pursue John's conversation further.  Let's talk tomorrow.  Lousie 
 nope 
 Scott just sent you the message before I'd finished.  So I have a real long shot for you to talk to at some point. Matthew Scrimshaw - I don't think he'll move to Portland but he might.   So an ideas yourself? 
 well - what do you think of that!  I have someone who is a suplong  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 no  - only if specified is my understanding, although on flat panels they are now trying. 
 No problem - the issue is I can never find you on the Address Book, because of the C.  Louise 
 yup 
 Not really enough detail on specific areas where they are crossing territory.  We know they are talking to munis but are they talking to utilities? We need names etc.  Split the list into areas  Industrials in our SIC codes  Utilities  Munis  Thanks 
 Can't wait to see you.  I think its a good choice. 
 Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.  A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment.  So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW.  None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.  Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment.  Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels.  So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.  As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.  As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.  Thanks  Louise 
 I am trying to fiind out that date I became a member of the IOD and secondly if I still am.  Please could you let me know as soon as possible.  Thanks  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 Ok - I butt out.  EBS  only has a handful left now and with redundancies over there they are trying real hard to place their people. 
 MAke sure we get at least 15% reduction.  Thanks  Louise 
 Do these match ours? 
 I think we need to include groups with MPR where is was originated this year. 
 is in town?  Are you seeing him - if so are you taking anyone from power? 
 No concerns. We managed to get about $40mm reduction the IT development budget, you are picking up some of the reduced budget (See Lloyd Will's email of earlier today).  Let Lloyd know if you have any problems as we are getting fairly close to sign off.  Thanks  Louise 
 Just so you know

 OK 
 Power trading or Origination spring to mind.  Power Trading is interviewing Tim tomorrow, do you want me to set something up for you too.  Forster is  running one of the power origination groups, give hime a ring. 
 Looks like we are making outstanding progress.  This is great news. 
 Here's a little issue.  We have recently needed some screens, pcs etc for new starters.  Obviously this is a bit of a peculiar time to buy something when we are on the point of moving.  My understanding from Don Black (who is hiring these people) is that we have to use ibuyit to request equipment for these people rather than just get IT to give us a temporary (old screens from EGM) until we move.  What is happening behind the scenes on this issue - do you go an buy new ones or is someone substituting ones that are now redundent?  Thanks  Louise 
 Dynegy to run Orig - in Europe working for Cardone. 
 Do you really have someone as capable as Marcello.  This is an outstanding trader who we probably have no chance of getting but could run any desk we have.  Is your SE guy of that quality? 
 Today was the last date I discussed with Piper.  Before 4pm. 
 As I said in the note of yesterday - I have no interest in having the meeting. My assistant is away so its just a  misunderstanding.   See yesterday's note, we are going in on Monday.  I think losing Amita is a  major error.  There are no other candidates in the organisation with her expertise apart from Zipper, Forster and Savita.  Thanks  Louise 
 Before Matt left he deposited a confidentiality agreement on my  desk which dates back to August 6,  2001.  Jaime has it now.  What do you want me to do with it?  Sign it? 
 There are a lot of people who are not Enron Americas - please cut them out? 
  Expenditure verification  You have purchased some new computer screens - any particular reason when we all get in the new building? 
 Did you hear about  Jonathan?  Louise Kitchen 
 Please tell them - that I am cancelling due to the Budget process. 
 Brian Redmond or Jean Mrha will need to approve the budget as your number will be charged directly to them.  Brian or Jean please co-ordinate your response through Faith Killen. 
 Please could you do the following;  Cancel today 3pm	Barry Tycholiz 4pm	Weekly power meeting  Tomorrow 3pm	Lagrasta 4pm 	Frank Vickers  Friday 10am  	Brian Redmond 4pm	Brad Richter  Thanks  Louise 
 Just in case you didn't know yet 
 OK 
 Great photos is that all that's left of EBS's people in London - how many did you have a one point? 
 This is great - two please 
 If you have an issue you need to ring Eric Gonzales.  He shouldn't have had the meeting - there is a lack of integrity on this. 
 we only covered commercial. 
 great - two please 
 I went up to Chicago last week and noticed the lack of flat panels in the office.  We obviously have hundreds of redundent ones in ENA Houston (as the new building has new ones), they are going to redeploy them to you guys - Free (as we have already paid for them).  They are going to start with Calgary and Toronto.  Contact IT if they haven't contacted you.  Steve Harrington or Jenny Rub. 
 We can't wait for another meeting - we are in front of the OOC on Monday with the Enron Americas plan.  Here's my numbers (I got them from etrade!!!!!):  0 - 5000 transactions per day		$  8:00/normal transaction (including internals) > 5,000 transactions			$ 10:00/normal transaction Options					$ 10:00/ per option (using option grid) Take or Pay				Minumum Number of transactions per annum = 1,000,000 Service Interruption (outage)		Reduction in our bill of $100,000		(less than 30 minutes) Reduction in our bill of $500,000		(greater then 30 minutes) Per product type set up 			0		(its in your interest as the number of transactions is high in ENA.  It think this issue is for other groups.) On development 			0		(its in your interest - I think this again an issue for other groups.)  Now we all have the same incentive - grow the number of trades. I think this is pretty close for us.  Only paying once for a sleeve trade.  Let the games begin!  Louise 
 I don't just mean the logon I mean the domaine name too, once you are in EnronOnline you need to stay on www.enrononline.com/xxxxxxxxxxxx.

 Thanks 
 Did Howard attend - if so how's he looking? 
 Thanks - I have used it already to Tim.  I mentioned the Beth concept - I'll let you know what he says.  Jeff Richter is too busy  - he runs EES in the West.  Keep thinking though I like the idea of Jeff or Barry. 
 I think we are moving towards this concept. Steve Hotte will take over from Beth Perlman as CIO ENA. Anthony Dayao will remain CIO EES but in addition to Anthony's EES responsibilities, he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system working closely with Steve Hotte.  On the commercial side, I am thinking Beth.    I have had preliminary discussions with Beth and Mark on her moving over to our side to manage our requirements.  If you have a problem with this - let me know.  I have to say finding someone to do this is a difficult job and all ideas welcome.  I think Beth brings a base understanding of the business and certainly should be able to drill down on IT side.  Its a huge budget and we need someone really responsible for it.  On the operations side, I have asked Sally to take a large portion of the IT development budget into her budget as essentially its things like maintenance.  Sounds like we are thinking the same thing and we have made some progress towards this goal.  Louise 
 Joe Deffner needs to take responsibility for reducing these costs and ensuring that our allocations are appropriate - the ones that really stand out to me are Kelly Boots and Glisan.  Joe needs to get comfortable with their allocation methodology.  Louise     . 
 I am also meeting with Robert on your contract - so we should get that done today.  Thanks 
 Great news 
 Can't remember whether I thanked you for this - if not - thanks for your prompt response.

 Cris  Bit of an issue here.  I had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature.  I really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market.  We also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high.  Please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them.

 Why can't I consume alcohol on Atkins? You should not drink alcohol during Induction, but you can drink moderate amounts of alcohol during the Ongoing Weight Loss, Pre-maintenance and Maintenance phases of the Atkins Nutritional Approach. When given the choice, your body will burn alcohol for energy before it burns fat. But alcohol does not act as a carbohydrate so it will not interfere with burning fat in the same way that sugars and other carbohydrates do. Alcohol consumption may also increase yeast-related symptoms, such as bloating, gas and cravings for sweets, and can therefore interfere with weight loss. Beer, which contains yeast, probably has the most yeast-forming components of any alcohol. An occasional glass of wine or vodka is the best choice. Scotch and other grain-based spirits are more likely to promote yeast problems. Note: Use only mixers that contain no sugar or fruit juices. Even tonic water contains carbs and regular soda is made with sugar. Seltzer, club soda, mineral water and non-aspartame diet sodas are better alternatives.   Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308

 With Calger leading the likes of Parquet etc they can make $100mm plus - without him no chance.  I think it's sort of indirect p&l.  I think we are close enough I'd put our top 20 above any group - our final ten are really strong too.  Harry, Orlando and Zipper as the last people on our list really does show we have some major talent.  Let's not stick to 30 - let's do 33 putting Miller,Deffner, Foster, Zipper, Ermis and Aucoin in.  Daliney's note shows he is giving a lot to people we have in our second half of the list. 
   I see what you mean. 
 I didn't get a copy of Dave's email but a few comments and I attach a compromise ordering.  I added to your file schoolyard.  Our differences are: Me - Don Miller, Joe Deffner,Chris Foster You - Zipper, Ermis, Aucoin  I would put them all ahead of Bernie however I have no data points apart from p&l on nothing with Frank so I can't comment on him..  Not huge differences in order, apart from your slant on Canadians!  The main issue with yours is Calger behind Benson and Zufferli (and even maybe Dana), he's a future leader of this organisation.  Your ordering is very P&L based.  Are we supposed to cover Wes or will Causey?  I added to your file schoolyard.  Speak to you later.

 Where's the answer 
 Marcello is getting very frustrated.  Only Matthew is talking to him (all second hand). 
 Please register  Talk to Liz/Nicki to see if they want you to attend to help - only if you want to 
 I need a description of each of these assets asap - no more than one sentance on each.  Before 9:15am if possible on email so I can pick it up on Blackberry.  Thanks  Louise 
 So far I have spoken to both Bill and Rick Buy, both of whom recognized the issue and said they would try to address it.  I have also just completed their budget for next year and increased the number to allow for incremental staff.  I left a message for Bill this morning to see if he had made further progress. 
 Please do 
 ATS is not new origination and shows through the MPR.  All the rest were too small.  Louise 
 great news 
 Their current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we're wrong about them.  In your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us.  I read they pay us but Carl tells me it was the other way. 
 We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:  Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power Lloyd Will for East Power Geof Storey for Gas Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada. Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.  Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.  I am assuming its zero at the moment.   Thanks  Louise 
  Woops  Another coming in 5 minutes. 
 Thanks 
  diary 
 Seems we missed a circulation - this wasn't the last one circulated on Friday.  I will send you the final one at 12. 
 Duran to run it 
 Not prizes for that title. 
 George,  We are pretty sure DealBench is the cheapest in the market place -  we are way below others for costs.  Do GSS use DealBench for all our sourcing now?  Louise 
 Been there, done that.  This doesn't allow us to you have to be based in London!!! 
 I do need to alter one slide and also I am keen to see the financial slide whenever it is done.  Hope you had a good week-end. 
 If you pursue the overtime issue, coul dyou please let me know.  Thanks  Hope you had a good wek-end. 
 Hello - hope you had a good week-end.  Two things - PIPs are still not done and I still have never had my pay reconciled.  Thanks  Louise 
 Hello Pat,  We would like you to price:  Chairs (2) The chairs (476) in 19-502 (Grade 18) with double welt trim as described.  SOFA The sofa (6386-80) in 48-137 (Grade 26).  PILLOWS 3 square additional pillows (2 in chair material and 1 in sofa material).  Would the wood be the same in the sofa as used on the chairs?  Please could you let me know the prices.  Thanks  Louise Nettelton 
 When is that lunch with the Board we got invited to?  What time are John & I presenting at the Board?  Why do I have meetings on Wed - I thought Chicago was Wednesday? 
 I am hope I haven't just refused this for no reason but if my diary is right - Marcus is away. 
 I can't do these dates.  I will be on my way back from Chicago (Peoples meeting).  Sorry  Louise 
 Not entirely sure - John requested this on Friday I 'll check 
 WAHEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 When is it - I can't miss that if its the budget meeting?  It appears to be every day.  I am a bit worried now about next week - I appear to have some real scheduling difficulties. 
 When is it as Marcus is away on Thursday - I presume Chicago is Wed and obviously I can't do Philadephia as Marcus is away.  I presume you know all this - am I looking at the wrong week - is Chicago next week? 
 Could you put together  a list of all the Enron Corp employees who have Enron (non-Dell) equipment at home. 
 You have two problems  (i) Unwind of interest rate swap ($2.3mm) (ii) Mismatch of money from swap versus interest rate swap. (approximately ($9mm) is not offset)  Louise 
 and the current slides you have on display I'll then do the updates to our slides and correct the errors.  Thanks

 No reason I can see 
 I know that's why I am hoping/assuming we are not going that way.  I'll assume we are off standards unless you tell me otherwise. 
 OK 
 Like to me with you today. 
 Duran has to okay it 
 At least she will not keep quiet. 
 Amita is now free 
 I think I have your replacement for Savita. 
 Was down $10mm in Q3 - did you know? 
 Hope you saw the funny side and it cheered you up! 
 Yes 
 One pc - 3 screens  Thanks 
 Its non specific - the trades are there but with no counterparty names. 
  Thanks - appreciated 
 We'll guarantee a minimum of $200,000 for 2002 based on current price of $25,000 per data room.  We will not agree to an allocation though.  Thanks  Louise 
  See photo http://www.fortune.com/indexw.jhtml?channel=list.jhtml&list_frag=list_5columns_powerwomen.jhtml&list=22&_requestid=8742 
 We are pushing back heavily on several budgets and instead of cutting costs, they are just planning to hold more of the allocation up at Corp.  Some areas are better than others but essentially, the overview is moving the wrong way (UP!).  We have no jurisdication over the Corp numbers.  As an aside, the technology budget is up dramatically from last year, the numbers coming from IT are huge ($735mm this year (excluding Europe) versus $600mm last year for the whole of Enron Corp).  We are all over this one but progress is slow.  If you want more details - let us know. 
 ok 
 Itss crap - almost all of our own websites.  I've read it - probably have a copy somewhere if you want it. 
 "What happened to this guy? 
 Thanks 
 is speaking to Mike McConnell today 
 Where are we with www.enrononline.com? 
 No fine thanks 
 I really want it in Q4 - not Q3 
 Yes and Yes 
 Broadcast voicemail - sounded good! 
 Cheers Big Ears 
 Surreal experience really.  I was hoping no-one noticed.  PR did it and as you can imagine - without asking. 
 I rang Jeff - he's out 
 Funny though isn't it! 
 Ha bloody ha 
 No absolutely not 
 Can you ring these guys and tell them to deliver immediately  (at their cost as it is late) whatever they can of the order. 
 Hideous isn't it - I'm 9 months pregnant in it. 
 I'm planning to go see Greg with Wes for 10 minutes on Friday to let him know how far we have got with the budgets.  (IT budget for this year is $735mm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - I'm still working on this one obviously) 
 Trying to keep it quiet too - sems to be working - Lavo didn't even see it 
 Good idea to prepare a list - we shouldn't distribute but push the discussion to cover them all.  But definitely put a list together.  Thanks 
 I can't tomorrow - how about next time she is in town.  Or in New York? 
 Give her 13 
 I'm ok 
 Both interruptible and firm.  Thanks

 Wellhead Desk  Can you please send Jean a list of the 9 people. 
 yes 
 0Knew as usual nothing about this until it was too late. Enron nominated 5 people.  I'm trying to keep it quiet. 
 me 
 Geoff  This cannot be right - its millions I thought we were about $5mm all in including the secret Zhei project 
 I'm still here too 
  Great thanks 
 Just a quick question  - 23 years for PGT? 
 I concur with your view .  No to all of them  Louise 
 What's wrong? 
 Oh - never mind - haven't they heard of a fax?  It'll happen 
 nearly time to go 
 Let's try and keep this quiet. 
 We passed each other .  This answers all my questions  Thanks 
 Just to check have you ever done anything other than gas and zinc.  If so, when and how much? 
  Don't worry orig is what I wanted 
 Thanks very much - perfect. 
 Funny. 
 I am a bit confused I thought we had agreed to the following last week.  Expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved.  Issues:  Why are there so many repeat lines, each request is  issuing 3 times in some cases.  Will this mean we order three by accident? I have no idea what has been ordered - last week I could see this time its all in code.  Please resend with descriptors.  Thanks  Louise 
 Need to include Saguoro 
 Not for Canada -- for the US 
 thanks - I await the next update 
 P&L 
 Haha - definitely not! 
 Hideous photo - couldn't we have given them a better one! 
 Let's hope no-one else notices.  Let's make sure no-one does anything internally so people notice it.  Thanks 
 Obviously it is not what we want - we are assuming Anthony has power Beth has gas. 
 Why is the CA dated August 6th - have we been sitting on it since then? 
  Is it written yet? 
 Forgot Saguoro (sold it last week) 
 but here is where we got to. 
 and mtm 
 Can you please email me a list of the development sites we have sold this year, what our basis was and what p7l we expect of have from each site.  Please include Onondaga and Doyle, AES site etc.  I need it asap.  Thanks  Louise 
 We still have toadstools/mushrooms and holwa in need of new turf on the lawn.  Any news?

 Joe Deffner but what about the credit implications? 
 Can we have all PIPS signed and on my desk by end of play tomorrow.  Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 Great news - it'll be great for you 
 So did you move to Rebecca's job? 
 Just got your message.  Give me a ring to discuss. Its a great idea - I am thinking Power origination but let me know if you'd prefer gas.   Louise Kitchen Chief Operating Officer Enron Americas Tel:  713 853 3488 Fax: 713 646 2308 
 How good I am at responding - suffice to say I have stuck in budget meetings for the entire week.  Have you gone yet?  Are you free for lunch?

 Are you working on the new Contracts? 
  Ted,  The people included in the cc: are those people we nominate to interview on the below mentioned days.  We have not checked their availability and should you not find enough people from the list above please revert to John or I, but I think you have enough.  Louise 
 It worked 
 Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.  Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.  John/Don - can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward. 
 Thanks very much.  Louise 
 You won - it was a convincing argument 
 Could you fill in all the other assets  Thanks 
 What about the actual small video tape in the video camera? 
 Mr Haedicke instructed destruction of the videos.  As we couldn't tell which was which - they all went.  I would assume Calgary has a copy.
