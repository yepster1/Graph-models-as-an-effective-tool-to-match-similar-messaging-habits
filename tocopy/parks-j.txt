 hey, send me that easter picture again 
 SOCCER IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE OLYMPICS. 
 no joke, 
 Hey, today is my last day. It has been a pleasure working with you. Good luck. Joe 
 sometime this morning? 
 what s your number 
 =20 
 CHANGE YOUR FONT, ITS FAGGIE 
 Lets meet at 1pm today to discuss issues for the power plant. Location: Somewhere in the south building, we will figure that out. 
 i think so, maybe tomorrow 
 i should be over today at some point in time. 
 o:\gas structuring\centana_duke\CIPCO Payment Request(escrow) You will also find the other request associated with Centana. 
 I will hopefully have a meeting today with whom ever will be taking over.  Would you like to attend?  If not, I will make myself available for you if you want to meet. Also, I have put all relevant files on in the o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV folder. Not sure you have access, but Ed can get them. Attached is a file that contains some cliff notes.   Good Luck, Joe 
 Hey, look at this. This should be helpful. Let me know if you want to go over this.  Joe 
 Ed, Below are some comments on the deals I have been working. Who would you like for me to hand these over to? Duke/Centana Money wires will be complete on April 1. The proceeds from the transaction were received on Friday and the money that needs to be put into escrow will be sent out Monday, April 1. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\centana duke, where I have put the files for the cash request forms, wire transfer forms and the mini- DASH. There is also a cashflow.xls that explains the calculations for the dollars. I also have a file on my desk. The commercial contact for Duke Field Services was Greg Swedinsky 713-627-6265. In order to finish the transaction, a decision needs to made with respect to the contract and a settlement on pre-petition dollars. Ponderosa Energy Partners I have been helping Rick Hill and Chuck Ward manage the supply for the Tenaska IV power plant. I have created a folder o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV where I have put files relevant to the project. The file PPEP2.doc are some of my notes that I think will be helpful to whom ever takes it over. I  recommend Chris to help manage this, if that works for you. Pace Energy I have a letter from Pace that explains what actions they have taken. The dollar figures are less than $100,000. General Land Office. I have a file that contains a copy of the contract between GLO and ERAC and a copy of an internal deal sheet for the natural gas volumes. 
 9369 TOMORROW 
 The answer is yes. Money was received Friday and Doug should be getting approval to send the other out today. 
 Stuart, I have attached a cash flow worksheet that will walk you through the calculations. The file is located 0:\gas structuring\Centana_Duke.  You will also find other related materials associated with the transaction. 
 Sorry, just missed it. 
 Phil, Not sure the money will hit today, but It should definitely hit tomorrow.   The actual amount we will receive will be $2,735,050.05.  Further, I have requested  that 228,250 be wired out on Monday to JPMorgan. 
 Have a good flight back. Thanks for your help. Its been a trip. Happy Easter Joe 
 Have a happy Easter! Lets talk next week. 713-853-9636 
 hey joe, where are we suppose to go and with who?( a guide?)

 This is what I show what the partnership has done with TXU Thanks Joe 
 FYI- SO 
 GO Doug Money. 
 He is out of the office until about 11:30. My gut is that this is not going to happen until tomorrow or monday. 
 Chip Checking with you to see if we have approval to pay Duke Field Services. Let me know.  Thanks Joe 
 i agree, its just that i sit on floor where a lot of people can see my screen 
  chip has the info, not sure what his opinion is. thought you would know 
 Doug,  money! yes? 
 b, not sure that was appropriate, however you should send it to my home jparks1@houston.rr.com 
 Would you guys please call me in the morning. We need to get some reports before lunch tomorrow.  Thanks Joe 39636 
 I am going to walk over there ( ED recommendation) if  I do not catch you, call me on my cell phone 713-408-7962 thanks joe 
 This is the latest and greatest from centana. Are you ok with this,  will you review? 
 Chip, I just want to follow up my voicemail. If you can get with me by the end of the day or first thing tomorrow, I would appreciate it. I am trying to get the Centana Storage resolved and need your opinion/approval on an issue.  Thanks Joe 
 You need to let me know if you want to sell volumes. I have to find a market.  Nominations are due Thursday afternoon. 
 whats wrong chet 
 Ed,wants me to get this deal closed. I spoke with Stuart and he would like your opinion on using the proceeds from the sale to cover the expense of the MRT gas. He seems to think it shouldn't be an issue given that ENA is counterparty to both. Of course we would need to add language that would require Centana to show that it has paid Duke Field. Lets Discuss.      ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

 Scott and Daivd, I sent this to Chance as well. Look at it and let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks Joe 
 Ed, I spoke with Linda this morning. If we are intending to buy them gas for April, we need to know ASAP because nomination deadline for most of the Texas Inta-state   pipelines ( ie:Lonestar) is tomorrow by 2pm. 
 Made some minor changes 
 Chance, take a look at this file it will give you an ideal of what formate we are looking for on a consolidated report. We need the info non-PVed. Also, the oxy Info needs to be seperated. Info we need is:  Wholesale Financial Price Basis Nymex Equiv. Index  Wholesale Physical Price Basis Nymex Equiv. Index  EES Financial Price Basis Nymex Equiv. Index  EES Physical Price Basis Nymex Equiv. Index 
 Spoke with Chance on friday, he believes that the wholesale data is clean. I also sent an email to Chance, Pat and Scott that raised the issue of PV'ed positions. I am waiting for a response.  I have attached a word document that briefly describes what I learned from my meeting with Linda Roberts. I will also give you a copy of the GLO/ERAC contract and a copy of the dealsheet for the gas. Any questions give me a shout. Joe 
 working on it 
 I will try to pay Duke Field Services  $293543, ASAP 
 Louis has brought up a good point. Are we able to see positions non-PV? also can we get a seperate nymex equivalent basis position 
 HEADS UP. 
 both list are on here, the one you are looking for is 3b 
 Shemin, you still stand by what you said below? 
 well, well 
 I have spoken to Reliant,TXU, AEP, Coral, El Paso, and Aquila about buying the supply we have in storage. They have either told me they don't have any interest in buying it or they just don't respond. Centana is willing to buy the inventory if we will pay for the gas we received in December off of MRT. I have gotten Shemin Proctor's opinion on the situation (see attached). I would like to move forward and settle these issues with Duke/Centana. I have also included estimated cash flows on the transactions. Thoughts?  Joe 
 Louis, I, for now, have requested wholesale basis positions(price equivalent) be keep out of the price report. Further I have requested a seperate basis report that will show similiar information contained in the price report. I would like to look at basis correlations before including them in fixed price. 
 Thought you would want to look at this.  Thanks, Joe 
 Sent notice to Williams. They imediately responded that they had credit issues and were waiting to hear from us about the letter of credit. 
 Ponderosa Pines Energy Partners will be taking 25000mmbtu per day for the month of April. 
 After speaking with Linda, it appears they have a claim against ERAC ( Enron Reserve Acquisition Company), a non bankrupt entity.  Ed, who do you think I should have Linda Roberts send a letter stating GLO's position? 
 let me know more details. i am interested

 we recieved gas from Duke Field Sevices(flow dates: dec4-31 on mrt) and deliverd it to Oneok per a sale agreement entered into pre 12/1/02 
 Yep, still here. Things are pretty slow, just waiting to get the hell out.

 Look at page 75 of the pdf file. 
 Hey, got a call from Jeff Smiron. Apparently he has an invoice he needs to send. Do you want to call him and give him a fax so he can send it.  Thanks 
 Let me know when you have a minute. 
   ENA had a term supply contract with Energen to purchase roughly 4,485MMBTU a day at 2.60 on MRT, which Energen terminated on December the 4th, 2001.  The operator for the supply, Duke Field Services, erroneously allowed  supply to continue to flow between Dec. 4-31. ENA also failed to remove its nomination for the supply, allowing it to continue to flow to ENA's market, Oneok.  Duke Field Services would like to get paid for the gas it delivered and has offer to sell ENA the gas at a price of 2.3375 (gas daily average for MRT West Leg).  I have spoken with David Eubanks in gas settlements and he shows ENA receiving and delivering the gas to Oneok.  I would like to try to get the MRT issue settled as soon as possible, for I feel that it would help facilitate the Centana Storage account (approximately $2,500,000 in positive cash flow). Although Duke recognizes that it has no offset rights for the two issues, they seem to be taking their time. 
 talking today 
 Sure would like to be able to sell that inventory.

 Jim, do you think we want to be in the middle here, it might be cleaner to send the money back to el paso 
 hey, why get in the middle. its not our responsibility to get AEP their money. Don't you think it would be cleaner to just give it back to EL Paso. 
 just got it 
 Paul Paul, thanks for forwarding my resume to Tom.  I met with him and several other nice people over there this afternoon. They seem like a great group to work with. The position sounds very interesting and like it would be a good opportunity.  Hopefully, something will work out. Again, I really appreciate your efforts.   Thanks Joe 
 LOWER, however it doesnt break soon. it will consolidate. dont see any big rallies or major pull backs 
 no , let me get a few more questions answered. than we will put it back on. However if you think we should, go ahead. 
 Phil, lets take Centana off the forcast. I dont think anything is going to happen that fast. 
 Margie, that time works with my schedule. Let me know when it is finalized. Thanks, Joe 
 SPOKE WITH CENTANA, HE HAS TOLD ME THAT HE IS WILLING TO LET ME SELL SOME OF THE INVENTORY. HE HAS STATED THAT HE WILL WANT TO KEEP SOME OF THE INVENTORY AS COLLATERAL FOR PRE AND POST PETITION DEMAND  FEES.

 HEY FOOL, YOU THOUGHT COLUMBIA WAS BAD, THIS SHIT SUCKS ELEPHANT BALLS. 
 T he first detailed allegations that Enron abused mark-to-market accounting to hide wholesale trading losses have emerged in congressional testimony pro-vided by a professor and former deriva-tives trader who reviewed the Enron case for Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee. Those charges, along with allega-tions that have surfaced that mark-to-market accounting was misused by Enron Energy Services, the company's retail energy and services unit, are expected to support the push by accounting rulemak-ers for much more disclosure on mark-to-market accounting practices and the impact of mark-to-market accounting on earnings trading firms' earnings. In testimony Thursday before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee last week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-ty of San Diego Law School, said it appears that Enron traders mismarked forward curves and manipulated the amount of profits and losses that would be reported in financial statements. "In a nutshell, it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to cre-ate false profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-atives Enron traded," said Partnoy, who reviewed the case over several weeks at the committee's request. "It appears that Enron traders selectively mismarked their forward curves, typically in order to hide losses." "Traders are compensated based on their profits," he observed, "so if a trader can hide losses by mismarking forward curves, he or she is likely to receive a larger bonus." Partnoy said mismarking forward curves was not the only problem. "For each trade," he testified, "a trader would report either a profit or loss, typically in spreadsheet format. These profit-and-loss reports were designed to reflect economic reality. Frequently they did not. Instead of recording the entire profit for a trade in one column, some traders reportedly split the profit from a trade into two columns. The first column reflected the portion of the actual profits the trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rent financial statements. The second col-umn, ironically labeled the 'prudency' reserve, included the remainder." Partnoy told the committee that in his estimation, "Enron's 'prudency' reserves did not depict economic reality, nor could they have been intended to do so. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fund that could be used to smooth out profits and losses over time. The portion of prof-its recorded as 'prudency' could be used to offset any future losses," he said. He recommended that investigators question Enron employees who were involved in these transactions "to get a sense of whether my summaries are complete." Alleged Enron abuses of mark-to-market accounting emerge
