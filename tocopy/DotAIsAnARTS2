The term Multiplayer Online Battle Arena was coined by Riot games to create a distinct genre for League of Legends without mentioning it's connections to Dota.

However, it's exceptionally vague terminology is poor at describing the core attributes of a Dota-like game. It may certainly describe Dota and League of Legends in some way, but so too does it describe nearly every competitive multiplayer game in existence. Call of Duty is multiplayer, online, battle focused and restricted to an arena. So too is the latest Super Smash Brothers. Even a browser-based Chess game is multiplayer, online, a simulation of a battle and restricted to an arena...

The term Action Real-Time Strategy, in contrast, does a much better job of describing the genre Dota belongs to. Having arisen from an RTS, it shares a lot of gameplay and mechanics typical to that genre. The differentiator is the action focus in the choice to limit the player to a single complex unit, similar to a character in a fighting game. Hence the acronym ARTS.action means micro oriented over macro. please re-read the original argument.the difference is valve did not spend 2 years trying to destroy lol as an esport/game.

riot did. attack ads, exclusivity contracts for tournaments and teams, sueing valve over ip rights.

as someone who has built the ARTS scene off the sweat of my brow, i can fully understand the hate.the only agenda is we dont want to be buddy buddy with someone who spent ~2 years trying to destroy our hobby?

&gt;As a gamer it's hard to relate to companies intellectual property

this sentence does not allow the next one to follow and does not follow a proceeding sentence. 

may i ask what level of english writing you have taken? 
luck in what? you need a adverb or a verb. 

you cant just state popular phrases and pretend that is a conversation. not to mention DotA is the most played game in the world and DotA2 itself is fucking huge. 11million monthly uniques not including asian market. 

assuming 1% of them submit an overwatch case  a month (thats conservative) thats 110000 cases a month. 

good fucking luck.Nightstalker TA Lone Druidits this thing called micro. i think ARTS games are based around it or sumtin&gt; What? No it isn't. League is the most played. It has like 4x the play rate of Dota 2.

I said DotA is the most played game, not just DotA2

that is fact behind statistics.Again I said DotA is the most played game, not DotA2.

DotA as a set of rules ecompeses WC3 dota and dota2are you serious? you think the original that spawned an entire pool of ARTS games isnt a competitor? you have what is known as regional bias.

 http://i.imgur.com/0BX5Csh.jpg

thats just a small sample. 

icefrog reported 32 million map downloads for dota before there was any competitor to compare with. there are still more dota games played than any other game in the genre.

and none of that is including dota2 which as 12million unqiues monthly not including the asian market.

just travel to any pc culture asian nation (bar korea) dota is huge, you simply don't know because icefrog isnt in the competition of rhetoric and numbers.

*the only counter proof you have is third party sources while we have many first party claims that still trump any other games first party claims and Valve's api to check numbers.*

statistically  speaking, dota was never trumped.the date is in the tweet if you are blind to pixels and data then please continue being ignorant. it does not hurt me at all.if only there was a search engine we could use to look up specifics based on the information we had...hmmm i think that might be a billion dollar idea!vocal minority. happens every news cycle.omg you may be right. i always played night elf :3causes mmr inflation. sorry you need to read up on the ELO algorithm to see why this is such a horrible idea.everything is viable in a pub. i mean everything. 

if you are losing half of your games then you are exactly at the mmr that best represents your skill level.

thats how the algorithm works.it is. are you new here.your title says that parties of 4 are excluded from ranked. that is old news.&gt; I don't believe that.

you dont have to believe it? its a well documented algorithm. you can just read the facts yourself.he didnt say he got radience before 15min. why is english so hard for you people.been playing since reborn beta. maybe your pc has cancer or is potato. you choose.downvoted. do not give shittaku clickbait headlines any clicks.

hell dont click on shittaku everits a dishonest media outlet thats all you neckbeard euphoric retard.okay english is really hard for you people.because it makes no difference.macs are toys dont expect to do any real computing using them.2/10 try harder.yup, the first question to be asked if its run by players or greedy corporations. 

that will tell you who it will benefit the most.bear should be able to interact with stash similar to how the hero can when dead. simple buff.they have namesno shit u retardsports ball are boring r u like an old man or sumtinwinning is fun you mook low skiller.zoey was much hotter without the lesbian hair.nope this thread is now about how zoey was best wifu when sholderhair.wutface this is what happens when you keep buffing ogre's int, suddenly hes a tower doctor. That it is the biggest eSport in the worlds by metric of prize pool and confirmed numbers of viewers and players. its 2015. none of this 'activist' online campaigns ever work. 

its easier to shame valve into caving than convincing people how they should spend their $$.

See: diretide&gt;but do we have higher viewer and player numbers?

nobody knows

&gt;confirmed numbers of viewers and players?

yes, since you asked about DotA and not DotA2 specifically.

for me its all the one sided games and people who have no business being in 5k somehow ruining a game for 9 people.a realist attitude means i dont work towards futility. 

for lots of people they enjoy playing hats in video games, personally i dont get it and you dont seem to either.

for these people they dont care about your complaints, and they are the majority as they are the casual players.there needs to be some oversight into actual game ruiners. we need software in-place to detect these players with a low tolerance then have a human review them for actual bad behavior.

then apply the suitable punishment. maybe even be create, for smaller offenses maybe take away their hats for some time while they cool off in low prio. and for greater offenses maybe disallow their account from doing anything in dota for X days then they can deal with low priority, a sort of soft-ban + probation.

also low priority needs a rework. currently low priority is a race to end the game, something needs to be done about this. maybe treat low priority game ruiners with the same punishments as typical dota games.what if i want both what about us entitled children who need more and more?plhantom lancer

i dont think alphabetical sorting works like that.im sure valve's financial team are collectively shitting their pants over this. furion can also offlane. hes not a bad pick by any means just watch any of [A]'s games, the hero has strengths that can withstand a competitive environment.whonope. dont need distractions from the game in-game.

if you dont want to play the game afk it out. if you cant adapt to change lol might be the game you for. no kappai doubt cs:go and dota share the same servers so it could easily be your network.

try verifying game files.because there is no practical use for it other than rewarding hats, maybe.

you will end up back at your same mmr after a few games, happens to me when i take a break from starcraft. after about 50 games im back in diamond struggling vs terran bio.&gt;I believe defending champions should get a guaranteed invite

nope. we get to see more dota, they get to practice more in a competitive environment.

invites are more detrimental now that the scene is more stable.all of those were stopped via public outcry not boycotting. 

gaben even made a public statement to the payed mods outcry

but nice try i guessplay unranked. random heroes and learn. go back to ranked realizing you practice and knowledge does help you.

&gt;The most frustrating part is I play really well in a stack with guys who are 4k 

depends on what you mean by 'really well' if you are not dominating the early/mid/late game according to your role then you are not 'playing well.'

its like singing along with a professional singer, it sounds good, but mostly because he is carrying the tune.

the same is True in stacking with higher mmr players, they are bringing up the average and making the game easier for you. if you were to play on their account solo ranked, you would get crushed under the weight of advisory experience.

&gt;Can I climb from the trench

The trench stretches deep into 5k mmr, you will always have shit team mates who have no business being at that mmr, so if you are asking can you break mid 5k using lycan? yes, but only if you are a 5k player already.

&gt;Nothing seems to make a difference.

thats the thing about practice, it doesent benefit you at a singular point in time. you practice over long periods of time to see the benefit over that period.

tl;dr your stack is carrying the gamers unless you are pub stomping them somehow, you are 1k mmr and only practice can raise that mmr.

edit: if you dont believe me pm me your steam id and we can 1v1 mid and see what level your mechanics are at.&gt; and they will less likely grief 

pure speculation. there is no causation between incentives to win and it stopping grief behavior. ive seen feeders deep into 5k where you would think everyone is there to win, i doubt they would stop feeding if you gave them a hat.

&gt;also seasons would reduce the amount of account buyers 

it would probably increase the amount if anything. to re-place a person in their mmr bracket post-season you have to give them the same places matches that you had at the very start of your ranked mmr. that means it would change marginally per game.

based off of my experience from playing since the 2nd key wave, it would change by a maximum of 1k if they lost every game, giving more incentive to buy an acount with +1k mmr since they ruined theirs.

&gt; sure at the start of the season games would be shit,

no they wouldnt? they would be of the same quality since the previous seasons mmr is used to find matches.

**im sorry but you need to understand how these systems are implemented before you can discuss them, you have a complete lack of knowledge on the basics.**&gt;I'm just getting down because I smash pubs and always lose in ranked.

it could be because you unranked mmr is much lower than your ranked one, which would make sense if you increased your ranked mmr lately.

the algorithm tries its best to give each team a 50% chance of winning, which means you should see ~50% winrate if you have been placed at your correct mmr for your skill.

&gt; It's just hard not to get down about it

I've never had this my problem myself. When I first started DotA i took it as a learning experience, and I still do. Maybe you would have an easier time if you took 5 minutes to watch your replays and identify any mistakes you made, even if you won the match. This perspective might give you a new way of thinking about the game instead of just win and lose.are you retarded. how would that be any easier. they are facing people of their same mmr.

the only way it could be abusable is if one person queued up on a 2k account and the other 6k.

just make it so they have to be in the same bracket. problem fucking solved ill take my signing bonus now volvo.except you are also playing against a 2 stack doing a similar 2man strategy you dumb fuck.

so both teams win according to you logic. 
2/10 think harder.probably better off with windows 10 for a marginal increase in fps.

yes OS does affect it, but OS only delegates the computation, at the end of the day your gpu is the main bottleneck.&gt; people had the biggest egos i'v ever seen

I've noticed this too. Everyone here thinks they are a pub star because they climbed to this bracket using the FotM. Then they fluctuate around mid to low 4k because their hero got nerfed and they take a long time to recover.

basically they think they are the kings of low to mid 4k. its really cute.took 18 minutes longer than it should have. its dead even in difficulty. the algorithm matches 50% for each team to win.because everything is kept server side so you cannot modify it?

computers 101?

do you also complain every time you have to download a webpage and its data?boohoo. grats for colorado i guessclient works fine if you dont have a shit pc.

lol who really gives a fuck about hats casuals thats who. go to csgoare you a fucking retard just using words you dont even know to sound smart.

cache is just ***temporary*** storage. bolded and italics for your stupidity.

it increases time complexity not memory complexity or integrity of data you fucking child go read a book.money != quality.

you can make a shit pc using $5000 because you are too fucking stupid to maintain it. 

only the retarded children have any issues because they cant figure out which driver and graphics library configuration works best for them.

 they are too stupid to install stuff basically.theres a lot of strategies that win games. and many more decisions that lose them.

winning in 2k is about pub stomping though. you can expect 2k players to make the correct decision even when presented with it.
i could literally buy your gf. so stop projecting son.youre right. the original definition states you must be white.kind of useless. as a general rule of them if your device doesn't have functionality specific to your platform then it should just be a webapp.

data vs binary?i been playing starcraft. its nice knowing it is  your team mates that were holding you back.yes you can. console.alert() and its response in the most basic software implementation of a push notification.


you can then insert the functionality into its own window of a subset of the current window.&gt; i could literally buy your gf. so stop projecting son.

watch the pros play pubs. then watch you play. any differences? fix them and you will climb.&gt; i could literally buy your gf. so stop projecting son.

all solved via public out cry not long-term financial boycotting.

gabe newell even made a statement regarding the paid mods directly to the complaints made by the internet.

 but nice try?are you a retard?the amount of micro required to play DotA is more along the lines of gold league in SC2.

its a dumbed down version of wc3 after all, if you suck at rts you will suck at micro.so you completely ignore that i said its a basic implementation right?

if you want to talk architectures i can explain to you how its implemented in the OS in android phones, but then again, you got my point and are just grasping at straws now.doubt it. multitasking has inherit risks in sc, i imagine the same would be True in dota.better question is why do you carenope&gt; so you completely ignore that i said its a basic implementation right?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; if you want to talk architectures i can explain to you how its implemented in the OS in android phones, but then again, you got my point and are just grasping at straws now.

dont ignore a whole post. its still relevent as response to this reply.&gt;  The greatest part about push notifications is that you don't even need to have the application open to receive a notification!

you realize the application is running right? have you ever coded on a mobile platform? its the same thing as a windows notification, the process has to be running, it has nothing to do with it being 'open'a push notification has two requirements. 

1. its a notification

2. you can interact with it.

why are you so dense? yes of course the app is running HOW ELSE CAN IT SEND NOTIFICATION TO THE OSwe are not envy we dont know.

my guess is he thought he cold farm faster if he didnt have to return to base, plus the armor is nice.are you fucking retarded? how can it send a notification to the OS without using processor cycles? the process DOES THAT OS SYSTEMS 101youre right, you are a computing genius.

you somehow implemented a notification architecture with less than constant time complexity, 0 to be precise.

enjoy your nobel prize, you are going to need it to fund your therapy you dense mother fucker.&gt;You're just ignorant to the facts.

oh the fucking irony.

a push notification is so simple yet you think you are next steve jobs because you can repeat ios rhetoric. fucking get over yourself.

its a notification that you can push, i had that shit in windows 98 please fucking open a book you half-baked pseudo-'intellectual' yes it is you fucking meta-shitpost. its an assessment of skill in how you do in a 1v1.youre right your understanding of push notifications on one platform gives you omnipotence on every other implementation of push notifications and how they are not push notifications.

cognitive dissonance at its finest. 

please learn the point of simple ui elements, i wouldnt want you to fail your introductory programming courses.&gt;Real games are hardly pure 1v1 matchups.

NOBODY IS SAYING THIS 

let me repeat for all you retards who got baited into a 1v1 after a bad game and lost

&gt;Real games are hardly pure 1v1 matchups.

NOBODY IS SAYING THIS.

now let me repeat for you slow children who cant read fast enough before posting

&gt;yes it is you fucking meta-shitpost. its an assessment of skill in how you do in a 1v1.you fucking retard its a 1v1. you are comparing apples and oranges because you are too stupid to realize its an assessment of skill in a 1v1 settings and nothing else.

the mere fact that you bring up 5v5 means you are stupid by a factor of 5.changing html source = le epik 4chan blackhat hacker mayme xD&gt;lol what are you trying to prove?

4Headnope. they are just two completely different systems. that proves that it was in source 1. you cant use the same api exploits in source 1 as source 2 as its a completely different api.

therefore, under the assumption that op's post is source 2 it has to be a new code base that does the same thing, this is called refactoring.

what does blizzard do again?im not talking about his match he linked im talking about the code he saw a month ago.game is dead because YOU CANT FUCKING PLAY IT no valve gives that money. they could easily keep all the of compendium $$ but after they get it they THEN decide to give 25%aint hard because i dont work for blizzard NO KAPAA 4headThe term Multiplayer Online Battle Arena was coined by Riot games to create a distinct genre for League of Legends without mentioning it's connections to Dota.

where the fuck do you think the money comes from? FROM THE FUCKING REVENUE STREAM ACCOUNTS.

jesus fucking christ its basic mathematics money has to go into the hands of valve before it can go to the players. 

you dense ugly broad.probably go back to lol. its like the call of duty of ARTS, we need the kids to stay in their pen.

typositioning is not luck.i would prefer to be a child making 6 figures than an old bitch with no skills and too ugly to fuck without a paper bag.

and that statement is True for everyone but you.&gt; positioning is not luck.

how can he entangle you if you have perfect positioning?
easy fucking bear damage learn the hero.nice logical fallacy. 3k mmr im guessing? learn how positioning works then maybe you can escape the 'trench'shaving gives you a skin condition?because you only know how to play one hero. you aren't even playing dota at that point, just that one hero.its pretty obvious when anyone uses it. software acts in a very distinct manner. how can you understand the limits of the heroes when you are only pushing the limit of one hero.

the logic does not stem from the original data at all.minus armor heroes with stats makes quick work of a single ancient.whats that. my monitor tans pretty evenly. sure position yourself that is more advantageous for you than your enemy. 

if the tries to entangle you, guess what YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR POSITION WHAT A CRAZY IDEA

your bear gets free hits on his bear due to your new positon (fucking mad i know bear doesent have instant gap closer)

suddly you win because you are not a retard who doesent understand positioning in ARTS games.

HOW FUCKING HARD IS IT FOR YOU 3K KIDS TO MICRO ONE UNITno its not? its a running average.hey he was only off by a factor of 2^84yes it can? do you know how running averages work? you have to define your dataset.

there is an easy way to change it that much, partition the discrete dataset, and that sub-set is your new dataset. 


26 making 6 figures. please soak in your jealousy because you smell like a fat bitch and need a cleaning.they kind of already did. navi is only navi while dendi is there.no he wouldnt. it would just be you can farm your team mates aghms. which is basically the same thing.a very small indirect nerf. if the situation calls for alch farming aghms for your other heroes then why would they built it themselves.

in that case its not even a nerf come to think of it, since we are talking about 'super situations' you are better off getting a low prio bot to do it for you.

it can detect those games that will not be counted so you can queue for a new one.those who cant adapt die.

rip in pieceswe need fucking region lock valve its 2015because its False. pain is fucking pain.if he waited 1 second thats a dead spectredownvoted.

attention whore nothing more.http://bo.my.openrice.com/userphoto/Article/0/L/00046EE71793991F2A76DCj.jpg

the same picture is used everywhere. this is the defacto standard.you are adding to the problemthis makes me miss state of the game if youre computer does not have a stable connection to the game server please do not queue.

note the game server and replay server (which the spectator uses) are two different things.useless dev time.because the casual gamer doesn't give a shit about the economy and will continue buying hats to play barbie dress up.

you economy scripters and afkers are a small minority. the rest of us are busy palying dota.enemy team picks viper. suddenly rip your chance at winning foreverthe point isnt in picking the hardest counter to ta, the point is the countering any snoball potential by stacking armor for your team and 5maning as early as possible.

you are too narrow minded, picks are meant to work for the whole game not just the lane.game was free before hats.

terrible logic.

btw cs:go has hats and is pay2play.

so doubly terrible logicletups in starwars battlefront I was amazing. probably the most competitive that game could ever be.DotA2 is DotA with a skin pack, they are the same game.

There is no proof other than claims by riot (which we can see now are very dubious acording the the shady things we see in the article in the OP). Other claims by third party websites are just that, third party claims, not first-party sources.

With DotA we have claims by icefrog, the chinese clients, Valve, plus Valve API to confirm claims made about DotA2. Allowing us to verify claims made by one party via those made by a separate party of API.

Not to mention Riot has a history of lying to the community such as their cover up for exclusivity contracts, requiring teams and tournaments to drop any ARTS that is not LoL, as confirmed by sir scoots.

If we look at the facts objectively, it means tencent/riot and their interest in lol's image is supported by propaganda, rhetoric, and coercion, as long as they can make $$$ from it. Tencent is even attacking its own players in china with this new information, a non-good-faith business indeed.

just look at the facts. its not up to me to persuade you into believing something that isnt True, thats more tencent/riots area of expertise. upvoted for the truth. most of my games are lost because people have poor ARTS decision making and I cant stop them from feeding our lead away.

its pretty disgusting how imbalanced mm is.it was free from valve.my favorite is picking legion commander blademaill front-girl. Then enemy huskar has to make a tough decision between initiation and item pickups. if huskar goes for a fast bkb, he wont do much damage to legion and you can still right click him hard.mongoloid5man wont work vs those heroes.

smart positioning with linkens later in the game or ratting out the enemy team will work every time.

and ratting in this context just means splitting the enemy team so your fights are more favorable while farming the entire map, of course you need specific heroes to acomplish this, furion/io+tiny do this well.how to tell someone is not a programmer.

and how to tell if someone is a programmer

all in one thread.there are many different kinds of color blindness.

it would be simpler if you just downloaded a color-switcher app for your specific form of color blindness and for your specific monitor.

have you ever done a mathematical analysis in your life?

the only way to analyze OP's post is by applying each step of a mathematical analysis as his question is a Game Theory question (a branch of economics, a mathematical dicipline). 

in other words, there is no initiate first because we are not taking into considering that X player's mom distracted him as he was sneezing because his cat blocked his vision with its tail and the tail blew some dust in his nose. The probability is not interesting or relevant on a applicable scale.

in other words, go do math, you suck at it.yeah you did no kappaBAAAH I DONT KNOW HOW TO PLAY VS SOME HEROES PLEASE NERF WAAAAAAAAHlol you fucking retard welcome to wc3/scbw/sc2 customs games/uams.update gpu driver change the graphics library you are using. bam back at 100 fps.

u can still play storm if ur not trashafk and start a new gamer  u a pro retardthe word you are looking for is interpretation.

and we used action as a synonym fo micro oriented for 10 years of custom games in wc3.

so please, dont spread ignorance.i think they are too complacent. even if they dont win anything dendi still brings the team tons of cash.they are looking into it, thats how software development works.

the problem is its a small minority which means collecting data on the issue is hard and its most likely user error 90% of the time.

im guessing most people dont even trouble shoot their own problems which could fix it the majority of the time since most environment states dont have this issue, the user simply does not know how to help themselves so valve can fix the issue.wow the power of hatswasent it 18myes. custom games in sc2 were so bland because it ended up just being the same top 10 in your face every time you opened up the client.wish it took 1k hours ur pc is shit top kek poor peopleit is? it purges then does the damage. debuffs/buffs have priority in calculation.go back to lol you toxic casual ARTS playerthis is incorrect. one will run faster than the other since they are allocating resources differently. 

the magnitude of that speed is unknown without benchmarks, but following the mod2 rules for windows, win10 will most likely be faster.well yeah its a computer, thats the idea. you want computations to happen without the user noticing it.control+shift+esc

help yourselffat grosslol chubby chaster the best players&gt;this mode is run entirely on the client side with no access to server, the game still hangs from time to time.

lets assume this is True, it may be your pc is just shit because i have no issues.the criteria for your pc being shit is you cant run software others can.

so by the definition of a shit pc, yours is the most useless piece of shit ever.

oh wait thats not fucking True in the least bit, literally nerfed storm can bully him out of exp.The term Multiplayer Online Battle Arena was coined by Riot games to create a distinct genre for League of Legends without mentioning it's connections to Dota.

However, it's exceptionally vague terminology is poor at describing the core attributes of a Dota-like game. It may certainly describe Dota and League of Legends in some way, but so too does it describe nearly every competitive multiplayer game in existence. Call of Duty is multiplayer, online, battle focused and restricted to an arena. So too is the latest Super Smash Brothers. Even a browser-based Chess game is multiplayer, online, a simulation of a battle and restricted to an arena...

Hence the acronym ARTS.are you retarded? its a low mmr game.crying about it is sure to fix routing issues out of valve's control.ur pc cant handle redrawing a frame in its entirety. your pc suck. dont alt tab.hurdur pipeline transformations != pipeline redrawinglol ur pc suck update ur software fucking pc inept kids shitposting on redditbecause there is a priority algorithm that determines what content you see?

if the algorithm is giving you content you dont want to see, then you are less likely to return to the sight.

you do understand this is entire idea behind reddit right?you are joking right? once you break 5k the meta is 'shit on the enemy mid until they lose confidence in their team structure'

alch is a prime candidate for shit consumption. i mean, its basic business practices and computer science.

if you are lacking high school level education maybe you should go read a book instead of flaming on the internet. yeah you have to be 9k to know that a team with t1 experience shitting on a non-tier 1 team with a niche pick does not mean that pick is the 'new meta' and should be emulated in 70% of pub games.

but fuck game theory and basic mathematical principles of statistics, your sarcasm trumps both.currently won every game verses alchemist in 5.2k

then again you are watching nothing pub games like a baddie and consider them competitive while the rest of us are playing captains mode and actually thinking about how heroes impact the meta and executing drafts which your tiny brain cant fathom, like actually ganking an alchemist mid.

tl;dr a retard watches a stream and thinks hes an expert on competitive play

get a fake tattoo. ez 900 dollaka &gt;being 5.2k makes you an expert on competitive play? 

-

&gt;yeah you have to be 9k to know that a team with t1 experience shitting on a non-tier 1 team with a niche pick does not mean that pick is the 'new meta' and should be emulated in 70% of pub games.
