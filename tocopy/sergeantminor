Sure. Do you want to spend $3000? Or would you prefer a less expensive build that accomplishes what you want? It seems like the logical thing to do in a $3000 build is to get a hexa-core processor. Dual-CPU setups aren't possible with Core CPUs. You'll need to buy two Xeon CPUs and a dual-socket motherboard. That can get expensive very quickly, but it may be in your budget. I won't be home for another six hours or so, so I can't put anything together for you right now. How's this? I know it's a lot of rebates. If you want to avoid/minimize those then let me know and I'll adjust it.

Don't be a dick.You can't add the second graphics card because the motherboard you chose doesn't support SLI.No PC can max out all games in 4K at 60 FPS, even with AA off, and especially if you don't plan to overclock. /u/obedear__'s build will get you close, but we just haven't reached that point yet.I can get behind the GPU change, if only because OP expressed interest in overclocking the GPU, which will bring the 960's performance closer to that of a 280X. As for the SSD change, I don't see why OP should spend $18 more for an imperceptible difference in speed.Is a 650W G1 is enough for an overclocked 6600K and two overclocked 980s?I've trimmed some of the fat from your build and added a few things as well.

* Added cheap aftermarket cooler for overclocking.
* Downgraded to 8GB RAM because you won't use more than that while gaming.
* Left your SSD alone. It's a bit pricey for an SSD, but it has a good warranty, and you are using it as your main drive. 
* Picked a much less expensive 980 from arguably the best brand.
* Added a good, inexpensive case.
* Picked a lower-wattage, higher-quality PSU.

Skylake doesn't seem worth the extra money. You could use that on something that will make more of a difference. This build is not SLI-ready, but I don't think that's the most reasonable upgrade path anyway. Let me know what you think.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to fit in an overclockable CPU setup, but the i5-4460 shouldn't require an upgrade for a long time, even if you don't overclock. I could've gone with an i3 and a stronger GPU, but the 750 Ti should be able to play most of the games you want to play at good settings. You'll probably have to turn down the settings a bit when playing Fallout 4, however. The 750 Ti does overclock nicely, so I would recommend doing that as soon as you're comfortable doing so.

It's not under budget before rebates, but since you're not planning on buying soon anyway this is more of a loose set of guidelines than a laundry list of parts. It's entirely possible that by paying attention to /r/buildapcsales you'll be able to find better deals and afford a better GPU (such as a GTX 950 or even an R9 285) between now and Christmas.

I'm just a little skeptical. A heavily overclocked 980 can use nearly as much power as a Fury, so adding another one and also overclocking the 6600K seems like it would be sketchy on any 650W PSU, let alone an average-quality one like the NEX.How large are the models you're working with? If we're talking more than 30 million cells/elements or so, we may need to adjust this to have more RAM.

Outside of that, probably not.For this type of work, a workstation GPU is recommended. Also, given the size of his models he will probably need more RAM.Here's another option, more along the lines of what /u/pmds25 posted. More CPU power with a less powerful workstation GPU. Also, smaller SSD. If you don't do a lot of rendering and/or visualization, this may be better.

* 240GB SSD for OS and games
* R9 390 with the fantastic PCS+ cooler
* S340 for minimalistic look and an easy building experience

* Full (non-OEM) version of Windows in case you ever upgrade your mobo
* 144Hz monitor for silky smooth gameplay

You'd better overclock that 970 to make it worth it!Nobody's disputing the fact that you can get way better performance for this amount of money. OP made it clear he was willing to spend extra for aesthetics.No problem. Not sure who's downvoting these builds without explanation, but let me know if you want any more or less than this. Mine is the only mini-ITX suggestion so far, and it's also the cheapest with all things considered. I was trying to keep cost to a minimum and going for a midrange GPU. I noticed others have recommended you the 390. I second that option if you're looking for ultra settings on future titles, but if you're looking for performance per dollar, I think mine will get the job done.I agree with /u/Kyle_Pq, 550W is plenty for a 390.[PCPartPicker part list](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/DJTCYJ) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/DJTCYJ/by_merchant/)

The performance benefits aren't worth that, in my opinion. You'll never notice the difference anyway. An overclocked 4690K is more than you'll need for any game out there right now. The GPU is where you want to be pouring your money.

Also, an overclocked GTX 970 doesn't use that much less power than an R9 390, so that bit about needing a "MUCH larger power supply" is a misconception. A 650W PSU, especially an average one like the NEX, isn't going to be enough for SLI if you plan to overclock anything.I was thinking i3 + 380, but I figured this would be better in the long run.

I'd recommend overclocking the CPU a little bit to squeeze some performance out of it. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LazZv1FIwQ) is a video explaining how to do this. Even with the CPU overclocked, you may only get 40-50 FPS in a game like GTA V, which is meant to be played on a more powerful CPU.

* [EVGA B2 750W](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-110b20750vr) ($60 + shipping, after $30 MIR)
* [Antec HCG M 850W](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/antec-power-supply-hcg850m) ($70, free shipping, no MIR)
* [EVGA GS 650W](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220gs0650v1) ($80 + shipping, after $20 MIR)

Personally, I'd pick the HCG. See /u/JakEmrys's link for concerns about single- and double-rail setups.Fair enough. Doesn't add much to the cost anyway. I don't think I can get this under $1250 before rebates without dropping the huge SSD. [Here](http://www.pcgamer.com/oculus-rift-pc-requirements-revealed/) are Oculus Rift's requirements, by the way. We're barely meeting the GPU requirement. You may be able to find decent deals between now and when you buy, but these are already pretty good.

At that point, you might as well just get a 2.5" SSD, since they're slightly cheaper, and you don't have to worry about getting a motherboard that has an M.2 slot. To me it doesn't make much sense to get an M.2 SSD unless you either really need the space (because you own a laptop) or you want the faster read/write speeds that come with an M.2 PCI-e (not SATA) SSD. The reason the SM951 is $400 is because it's a PCI-e SSD and is over four times faster than the fastest SATA SSD.

The 390 can play many games comfortably at 1440p, but there are some games that it won't get 60 FPS on ultra in. It depends what kinds of games you play. With more demanding games coming out in the near future, you may have to turn some settings down to play comfortably at that resolution. If you're okay with that, then the 390 is perfectly fine.

Some issues I see with the build you posted:

* Skylake doesn't seem worth it to me when you could get an overclockable Haswell setup for about the same price. You're paying more for the CPU, motherboard, and RAM, and the performance difference in games between the two architectures is small. You might as well get a 4690K and overclock it, which will beat the crap out of a locked Skylake CPU like the i5-6500.
* That version of the 390 had issues with Windows and rebooting. While I don't know if that is still a problem, the PCS+ 390 is available for only marginally more, and the PCS+ cooler is one of the best out there for this card.
* The EVGA B2 850W isn't a bad PSU, but the one I listed is a better value. It's of similar quality and is significantly cheaper, even without considering that it has free shipping and no mail-in rebate.

The build I gave will perform equal to the one you listed in every area that matters, while being $200 cheaper before mail-in rebates.

EDIT: Since you seem to be okay with spending $1300, here's one with a 4690K, which as I mentioned above will blow the 6500 out of the water after you overclock it (and will still beat it before you overclock it). There's no reason any gamer needs to buy anything better than a 4690K right now.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-06 23:44 EDT-0400 |I think the motherboard and graphics card are the best deals in the list. I'd recommend picking those up right away if possible. Alternatively, you could buy [this 390](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/powercolor-video-card-axr93908gbd5ppdhe) for only $30 more, which should run cooler than the 290 and give you a bit more overclocking headroom, due to the 390's improved architecture and the large PCS+ cooler.I should also ask you: How important are the Photoshop and video editing capabilities of this PC? I wasn't able to fit in an i7 and and extra 8GB RAM, but if you want it to be better as a workstation (as well as be a bit more future-proof), you'll have to either go over budget or drop the massive SSD.The build I just gave you is SLI/CF-ready. The motherboard supports SLI/CF, and the PSU is pretty hefty. However, I would verify that the 850W will be enough for two overclocked 390's and an overclocked i5. 

For reference, here's a comparable SLI-ready Skylake build. It's over $80 more expensive, and you'll never notice the difference in practice. If you insist on having the newest tech just because, then by all means go for it, but for most users it isn't justifiable from a performance-to-price standpoint. You might as well take that $80 and put it toward a 390X, which will actually have a tangible impact on gaming performance.

EDIT: Updated the previous build to have a slightly more reliable motherboard.

The CPU has great single-thread performance for the games you listed, and the GPU has fantastic performance per dollar. I recommend overclocking both the CPU and GPU. You can get an extra 30% performance out of the G3258 by overclocking it, even on the stock cooler. And the R7 265 should be able to overclock to at least the level of an R7 370, which costs about $50 AUD more at the moment. I know the case seems gaudy, but it comes with a ton of fans pre-installed. You probably won't need fantastic cooling, even if you overclock pretty generously, but it couldn't hurt to have it. The build is upgradeable, as you can replace the CPU with an i5, add an extra stick of RAM, and replace the GPU with something a bit more powerful without pushing your 500W PSU.

* Yes, Kingston did some shady shit when the drives came out, but this has nothing to do with the reliability of the drives. Even if you're getting an SSD that is slower than the ones initially reviewed, the bad reputation isn't one of failure, just False advertising.
* An SSD is an SSD. Differences in read/write speeds between different SATA III SSDs are imperceptible in practice anyway. Nitpicking about SSD speeds is like complaining that you have a Ferrari because it's not a Lamborghini.
* The WD Black is a mechanical hard drive. No mechanical hard drive is faster than, or even close to, any SSD. 
* Even among mechanical hard drives, the WD Black isn't a cost-effective buy. It isn't faster than other 7200RPM HDDs. It just comes with a better warranty.

I don't know why you think a WD Black is better than, or even comparable to, the V300. Sure, there are more cost effective SSDs than the V300, but not on the basis of read/write speeds. Being a snob about SSD speed makes no sense.

Of course, none of this even matters anyway, because OP is Australian and the build in question is in US dollars.Heads up, that build is in US dollars. It's outside of your budget.OP is Australian....which is still substantially slower than any SSD on the market. The WD Black isn't bought for its speed. You're pretty much paying for a great warranty. There are contexts in which it makes sense to get a WD Black. "As an alternative to an SSD" is not one of them.Did you not read my comment above or did you just conveniently ignore it? The V300 is not a "fast" SSD, but it's also not unreliable. Why would OP want a single 1TB HDD for the price of a 1TB HDD and a 240GB SSD? Even if the V300 were the slowest SSD on the planet, it would still be multiple times faster than a WD Black. I'm pretty sure you're just trolling, so I'll stop there.I'm totally fine with that reasoning. In fact I never recommend the V300 because I don't want to support shady tactics like that (although admittedly I regularly recommend other Kingston products). But avoiding the drive on the basis of speed doesn't make sense to me. It's slower than originally benchmarked, but it's still a decent SSD.What games are you trying to play?This should get you probably high settings (maybe medium textures) on Fallout 4, which is the most demanding game you listed. If you want ultra settings in that it'll probably cost you over $800.First of all, it's not available in Australia. Second, the PCS+ 380 is virtually the same (clocked 5MHz lower) than the Nitro 380, and it's usually substantially less expensive. PCS+ cards (including the 290X and 390) are great deals. Unless you have evidence that the PCS+ 380 has some sort of reputation for failure, it doesn't make sense to get something more expensive.Do you want to spend $2000? With that kind of budget you could go 1440p, but if you're fine with 1080p then there's no reason the build should cost you anywhere near that much.Fantastic build. May I recommend the [750W B2](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-110b20750vr) for $7 more?Trimmed some of the fat. This should give similar or better performance for a lower price tag. The CPU is clocked 100MHz lower (about 3% slower), but the GPU is better stock speeds, and the PSU is more reliable. With this you may be able to squeeze in a 144Hz monitor.

Definitely just stop by again when you're closer to purchasing. It can be helpful to buy parts over the course of a week or two while keeping an eye out for good deals, but much sooner than that it doesn't make much sense to recommend a part list.I was just trying to meet the minimum requirements for both MGSV and SFV. MGSV has a quad-core i5 listed as a minimum. However, I'll concede that the R7 265 probably isn't enough for SFV, as it lists a the GTX 480 as a minimum, which is a tad above a 265.

I just built my first PC a few months ago with some summer internship money. Definitely one of the most gratifying things I've done. Good luck with your new job!Well, all the more reason never to trust developers' PC specs. Disregard my suggestions, /u/cmbsfm.I've been recommending the 850W HCG M in a lot of builds recently. An 850W PSU of that quality, for $69.99, with free shipping, and *without rebate*? It was already a pretty awesome deal, and now it even comes with a free speaker. That's pretty nuts.Happy cakeday! Here's one that pushes your budget and, in my opinion, is pretty overkill. This is more of a 1440p build.

As for the part list, the SSD in the second build is an exceptionally good deal on a 240GB SSD, so I'd pick that up ASAP if you can. Same with the PSU. The 850W HCG M is a rock solid PSU, and it's a great deal at $70 with free shipping and no mail-in rebate. That deal has been running for a few days, and I would pick it up right now in case it ends soon. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/3nxp93/psu_antec_hcg850m_modular_850w_6999/) is some discussion if you're skeptical. You can even get a free speaker with it, due to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/3nwlgh/speaker_buy_any_antec_hcg_m_series_psu_between/) other promo, which ends in five days. The rest of the parts aren't exceptional deals, so no rush on those, but if your budget permits it I would get those two things as soon as possible (unless you want a bigger SSD or something).Good deals are constantly popping up all over the place, so feel free to send me another message closer to when you purchase so I can make sure you're getting the most out of your money. I'm pretty active on this sub and on /r/buildapcsales, so I stay pretty current.If you're not going to be purchasing for a month or two, then it would make more sense to ask for a part list then and not now. We'd be able to use whatever deals are available at that point in time. However, if you're just looking for some idea of what it might look like, based on current prices, here's my suggestion:

Not that the 500B is *bad*, but I would err on the side of caution and get a 600B or a high-quality PSU.* I think the G3258 is a better buy than an i3 if OP plans to upgrade anyway. However, OP did specifically ask for an i3.
* I don't see why you picked RAM that costs $10 more when there's no practical difference between mine and yours. 
* The R7 265 and the R7 370 are the same GPU, with the 370 being clocked 100MHz higher at stock. If we're already talking about switching to a G3258 (which ought to be overclocked to make it worth it), then OP could just as easily overclock the 265 to at least the same level as a 370. Either way, I don't think the 370 is worth an extra $40.
* I picked an ATX case in case OP ever wants to upgrade his CPU and get an ATX motherboard. The price of the Core 1100 will end up being higher if you factor in the cost of shipping, so I'm not sure what the advantage is there.
* If I were OP, I would get something more like this:

But in gaming, there will be zero performance difference between the fastest RAM and the slowest. If you can show me a benchmark in which faster RAM had more than a 0.1 FPS advantage over slower RAM (which is still small enough to be mere coincidence), and convince me that this difference is worth paying 30% more for RAM, then I'll consider myself corrected. 

I won't fight you on the case thing. It just depends whether OP wants a smaller or larger case, I suppose. It's a little ambiguous from your post, so do you need an OS? If not, here's one that's a bit over budget before rebates and a bit under after them. I could've gone with an i3 and slightly more powerful graphics card, but the i5 will last you for a very long time without upgrading, whereas buying a new GPU is easy as long as your PSU can handle it.

I think you can do better than a 970 in this build, but I'll leave that discussion alone and work with what you gave. Here's one that preserves the black/red theme, has no compatibility issues, and is ready for a second 970 should you choose to add another for SLI. I know you didn't ask for an SSD but I threw one in anyway because I know I would want one.

As for the CPU, if OP doesn't intend to overclock (and there would be no need to), then the G3250 is just as fast at a lower price tag.The size of your case isn't a concern unless (a) your motherboard won't fit, or (b) you need good airflow because you have power-hungry and/or overclocked GPU. If you ever plan to get a Full ATX motherboard, it may make sense to have a larger case, but there's no reason to go Full ATX over Micro ATX unless you need lots of PCI-e lanes for SLI or something. If you plan to overclock your GPU (or get an aggressively factory overclocked one like the R9 390), then you may want more room for airflow (although this may also require a PSU upgrade). The GTX 900 series has very conservative stock clock speeds and highly efficient architecture, so you won't be having any problems with heat on a GTX 950 unless you overclock it heavily.

As for modular PSUs, they're nice because you can choose to use only the power connectors that you need for your system, whereas for non-modular units all of the cables are permanently attached. This means that with a non-modular PSU you have to keep the unused cables tied up somewhere in your case, preferably out of the way of fans and other components. A minor inconvenience, usually, but modular PSUs are nice for that reason.Ah, the anonymous downvote. Does anyone care to explain why this was worthy of a downvote? Perhaps we can have a healthy discussion so I don't make the same mistake in the future when recommending builds. Not to mention that seeing detailed discussion will only help the OP make a better decision.

We're trying to help OP here. If you have a better idea, post it. And we're a community that's supposed to be able to give good advice, so if I'm doing something wrong, tell me so I won't do it again. Updated with suggestions from /u/Kyle_Pq and /u/somesortofusername. I wasn't able to fit in an SSD, but I think that's the most logical place to make a cut. I did originally have 16GB in the build, but I cut it down to make room for the Wi-Fi adapter. I suppose it does make more sense to downgrade the graphics card instead. I wasn't sure how much RAM is required for programming.

The last thing most of us want to do is give bad advice, so if you're going to downvote us, at least help us out and start a healthy discussion about it.There's a never-ending debate between those two cards on this subreddit (and related subs). The truth is that they're both fantastic cards, and you wouldn't be making any mistakes by getting either one. However, most people who are familiar with the two agree that, in general, you're getting better performance per dollar with the 390:

* The 390 is more aggressively factory overclocked, which means that its performance will, for most games, equal that of a moderately overclocked 970.
* The 970's more conservative stock speed means that it has more overclocking headroom than the 390. You might be able to squeeze an extra 10-15% out of a 390, whereas you might get 30-40% extra out of the 970. When both are overclocked, the performance difference between the two is a lot smaller.
* The 390 has less efficient architecture than the 970, meaning that even when 970 is overclocked to match the performance of the 390, it will draw less power and generate less heat than the 390. However, this difference is very slight, and people often exaggerate this point.
* The biggest advantage of the 390 is that it has 8GB of VRAM, compared to the 3.5GB of the 970. I say 3.5GB and not 4GB because Nvidia is a bit guilty of a form of False advertising with the 970. While it technically does have 4GB, the last 0.5GB was found, after release, to be much slower than the rest of the VRAM and left unused by many applications. This was a highly controversial topic after it was discovered. The 8GB of VRAM that the 390 has, many argue, is unnecessary. Currently, that is True. The only games that might use more than 3.5GB of VRAM are Shadow of Mordor and highly modded Skyrim. However, future games will inevitably use more VRAM, especially since we'll probably be seeing 16GB HBM2 graphics cards next year.
* There is some speculation, due to DirectX 12 benchmarks, that AMD cards will perform better than Nvidia's current generation of graphics cards in DX12 games, due to their support for asynchronous compute. This is still speculation, and DX12 games are still a very long way from being mainstream.

Again, let me reiterate, the 970 is a fantastic card. But if you see lots of people being nitpicky about the 390 being better than the 970, it's because we want you to get the most out of your money. The difference is small, but based on the information we currently have, there is a difference. The 390 is a card that few know about because they default to Nvidia cards. It's not their fault that they do this. It used to make a lot of sense to default to Nvidia. However, at a lot of price points, AMD cards are more bang for your buck, and I want to make sure you're aware of that option.Higher factory overclocking means the manufacturer overclocks the card before selling it. Nvidia and AMD make reference versions of the graphics cards, after which companies like EVGA and Sapphire modify them with custom PCBs, heatsinks, and coolers and change their core clock frequencies (AKA factory overclocking). If you're someone who wants the benefits (and drawbacks) of a moderate overclock, but don't want to do the work yourself, getting a factory overclocked card like the 390 makes sense. Higher factory overclocks are, in my opinion, the reason AMD cards have better stock performance, greater power consumption, and higher temperatures at many price points. 

I'm not a WoW player, but my intuition tells me that a 970 or 390 would be pretty overkill, even just to get a stable framerate. I'll do the research when I get home, but I suspect you can go pretty far down the food chain and still be safe. How's do you like this one?

* Over budget, unfortunately, but you had some pretty specific requirements and did say the budget was a bit flexible.
* Went with the R4, which is a great case despite not being an R5.
* R9 285 seems a bit out of place in this build, but you mentioned that the GPU isn't the highest priority at the moment.

The PCS+ is a really good cooler. Unless you need black and red for some reason, I say just pick this one up. Even a quality 550W PSU is enough. System peak power consumption stays in the low to mid 400's, even when everything is overclocked. The XFX TS 550W is on sale right now, I think. I got an EVGA 650W GS with my 390, and i think it's pretty overkill. You can do a 980 Ti build with OS for around $1100, but if you're only playing at 1080p, even with quite a few mods, a 980 Ti is still probably a lot.

If you're willing to sacrifice some graphics power upfront but make your build more upgradeable, you could go with an R9 Fury. This would allow you to overclock your CPU and get an SLI-capable motherboard and power supply. You did express some interest in overclocking, and doing so to your CPU may let you squeeze some more life out of it eventually. And the SLI-ready motherboard and power supply would let you CrossFire with two Furies eventually, which in some games can trade blows with twin 980 Ti's at 4K resolution. Both a Fury and a 980 Ti will be pretty overkill at 1080p, although how overkill it is depends on what mods you're using. The Fury is a better value, in my opinion, and it lets you get some more upgradeability out of the build.

I assume by this you mean the Skylake series, which I wouldn't recommend. It only improves by [about 6% over Haswell](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9483/intel-skylake-review-6700k-6600k-ddr4-ddr3-ipc-6th-generation/9) and isn't worth the extra cost of the CPU, motherboard and RAM. You should spend that money on something more worthwhile.

&gt; Full tower green case

Is there any reason in particular that you need a full tower instead of a mid tower? A lot of people don't understand just how large a full tower is, and a mid tower is large enough for just about anything except custom water cooling and certain case mods.

---------------------

Here's what kind of performance you can get if you take my suggestions. It's around $815 with shipping, before mail-in rebates. I could get it under $800 if I picked a case that wasn't green. What do you think?

You could even CrossFire with this PSU. Although in that case you'd probably want the 4GB 380.This is misleading. Newegg only lists what the manufacturer recommends, and AMD is unnecessarily conservative with their PSU recommendations. They often list 750W PSUs for graphics cards that have ~250W TDPs and wouldn't get a typical gaming build anywhere near 500W, let alone 750W. I don't think it's wrong to be safe, but following AMD's advice is absurdly and wastefully so.Again, misleading. This power supply can handle *any* single GPU on the planet and could safely handle CrossFire of a midrange card like the R9 380. Even an overclocked R9 390 build wouldn't hit 500W under a full gaming load.700W under max load with a single GPU? I find that hard to believe unless he has like 20 HDDs.Should get at least high settings in 99% of games. Included a beefy PSU for possible future upgrades to the GPU, and an i5 so you won't have to upgrade your CPU at all for a few years.

* $88 SSD is unnecessary since OP's usage isn't highly sensitive to read/write speeds.
* As much as In love the 650GS (I own it), that is a very expensive PSU for this build.
* SuperBiiz's promo is per purchase, not per item, so the price of this build is deceptive. 
* SuperBiiz has high, unlisted shipping costs, such as $16 for the case, putting the build further over budget.
* There's no need to push to OP's maximum budget if less will do the job just as well.Total system power consumption should peak in the 400's during gameplay. There's nothing sketchy about the PSU choice.How's this? Should come out to just about $650 after rebates and shipping.

The case shouldn't have trouble fitting the 390 in, at least as far as I can tell from the pictures. The case is supposed to be 13.78" deep without the front panel, and the GPU is 12.01" long, so I think it'll squeeze in even considering the thickness of the case and the front intake fan. If you're skeptical you could just get a different case, or spend $20 more on the MSI version of the 390.This looks like it's what you want. I would personally recommend getting a lower-tier GPU and getting an i5 and SSD right away, then upgrading the GPU later. I'd also recommend an R9 390 over a GTX 970, but let's see what you think about this first.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-02 23:18 EST-0500 |Hey, thanks for the shoutout! Can anyone confirm that this graphics card will fit in the case? The depth of the case without the front panel is 13.78", the GPU's length 12.01". It seems a bit close, and I'd feel bad recommending a build where the GPU won't get in the case. I'm skeptical, so I think it may be worth it to play it safe and get either a different case or a shorter version of the 390 (the MSI one is $20 more).It will fit just fine. If you don't mind another $20 rebate, I'd recommend [this one](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-case-nse200kkn1).&gt; I would prefer an Nvidia card as I heard they have a lot more useful software.

I'm not sure what that means, but the 970 that /u/jonbaa recommended will work great. It won't perform quite as well as the 390 at stock speeds, but it's close enough, and it's the same price, without the hassle of a mail-in-rebate.That's a really big budget. Do you want it to cost that much, even if it's overkill? Or do you want us to be at least somewhat conscious of your wallet?It's certainly not impossible, but even $3000-3500 will get you the best performance you can reasonably get with today's technology.

The PSU I selected is more than enough for any single GPU. If you want a really top-tier unit, the [EVGA Supernova G2 650W](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220g20650y1) is on sale for $60 after mail-in rebate right now, which is a fantastic deal. A Fury uses less power than a 390X, and even that should work fine with a solid 500-550W PSU. A quality 750W unit will run two Furies safely, provided you aren't doing any overclocking and don't have like four HDDs. Maybe you should provide some sources that show system power consumption anywhere close to 600W for a system like the one I linked. Nonetheless, here is the official TDP, as well as some sources for power draw under load, all from the first two pages of a Google search.

**R9 Fury power limit:**

[325W](http://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/zardon/asus-radeon-r9-fury-strix-dc3-oc/22/)That source only has vague recommendations, not actual data. I'd say it's about as useful as AMD's PSU recommendations. That is, unnecessarily conservative and not useful at all.I guess that depends what you plan to put on the SSD. If it's more than a few games, you may want to get either an HDD or another SSD later on.Should get at least high settings in 99% of games. Included a beefy PSU for possible future upgrades to the GPU, and an i5 so you won't have to upgrade your CPU at all for a few years.

* $88 SSD is unnecessary since OP's usage isn't highly sensitive to read/write speeds.
* As much as In love the 650GS (I own it), that is a very expensive PSU for this build.
* SuperBiiz's promo is per purchase, not per item, so the price of this build is deceptive. 
* SuperBiiz has high, unlisted shipping costs, such as $16 for the case, putting the build further over budget.
* There's no need to push to OP's maximum budget if less will do the job just as well.Total system power consumption should peak in the 400's during gameplay. There's nothing sketchy about the PSU choice.How's this? Should come out to just about $650 after rebates and shipping.

The case shouldn't have trouble fitting the 390 in, at least as far as I can tell from the pictures. The case is supposed to be 13.78" deep without the front panel, and the GPU is 12.01" long, so I think it'll squeeze in even considering the thickness of the case and the front intake fan. If you're skeptical you could just get a different case, or spend $20 more on the MSI version of the 390.This looks like it's what you want. I would personally recommend getting a lower-tier GPU and getting an i5 and SSD right away, then upgrading the GPU later. I'd also recommend an R9 390 over a GTX 970, but let's see what you think about this first.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-02 23:18 EST-0500 |Hey, thanks for the shoutout! Can anyone confirm that this graphics card will fit in the case? The depth of the case without the front panel is 13.78", the GPU's length 12.01". It seems a bit close, and I'd feel bad recommending a build where the GPU won't get in the case. I'm skeptical, so I think it may be worth it to play it safe and get either a different case or a shorter version of the 390 (the MSI one is $20 more).It will fit just fine. If you don't mind another $20 rebate, I'd recommend [this one](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/cooler-master-case-nse200kkn1).&gt; I would prefer an Nvidia card as I heard they have a lot more useful software.

I'm not sure what that means, but the 970 that /u/jonbaa recommended will work great. It won't perform quite as well as the 390 at stock speeds, but it's close enough, and it's the same price, without the hassle of a mail-in-rebate.That's a really big budget. Do you want it to cost that much, even if it's overkill? Or do you want us to be at least somewhat conscious of your wallet?It's certainly not impossible, but even $3000-3500 will get you the best performance you can reasonably get with today's technology.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-03 01:50 EST-0500 |I would absolutely not recommend getting a PSU without sufficient power, and I would especially not recommend a low-quality unit (loose voltage regulation, bad ripple suppression, etc.). The PSU I selected is more than enough for any single GPU. If you want a really top-tier unit, the [EVGA Supernova G2 650W](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220g20650y1) is on sale for $60 after mail-in rebate right now, which is a fantastic deal. A Fury uses less power than a 390X, and even that should work fine with a solid 500-550W PSU. A quality 750W unit will run two Furies safely, provided you aren't doing any overclocking and don't have like four HDDs. Maybe you should provide some sources that show system power consumption anywhere close to 600W for a system like the one I linked. Nonetheless, here is the official TDP, as well as some sources for power draw under load, all from the first two pages of a Google search.

**R9 Fury power limit:**

[325W](http://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/zardon/asus-radeon-r9-fury-strix-dc3-oc/22/)That source only has vague recommendations, not actual data. I'd say it's about as useful as AMD's PSU recommendations. That is, unnecessarily conservative and not useful at all.I guess that depends what you plan to put on the SSD. If it's more than a few games, you may want to get either an HDD or another SSD later on.Easy. Just take the card out of the PCIe slot, put the new one in, and wire it up to your PSU.Yeah not likely at all.If you don't plan on overclocking your CPU, this build should have optimal gaming performance while still being great for video editing. This build should be able to handle 1440p if you want it to.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-04 17:54 EST-0500 |I wasn't trying to sneak anything past anyone. However, the difference between the 2GB and 4GB versions of the 960/380 only exists in very specific situations. More VRAM capacity is one of those things that only helps if you're running out, and that's rarely going to happen in 1080p, playing at the settings you would typically use with a 380. 2GB is a good amount of VRAM for the power that the card has, in my opinion, unless you're CrossFiring them. And let's be real, who does that? 

Either way I wouldn't say that the "difference" is worth anywhere near $65. That's almost half the cost of the 2GB version that I linked, for a performance difference that will be zero 99.9% of the time. Can you demonstrate that the 4GB card has its merits at 1080p, and that it's worth paying more than a few bucks more for? I think that's a perfectly reasonable preference, and I'm the same way with my own PC (I own the 650GS). But one bad experience doesn't invalidate the many good reviews you can find on non-tier-one PSUs.* Newegg and Amazon are great, but not to consider other merchants is not cost-effective. At the very least, OutletPC is a great retailer with a flat shipping cost per purchase. 
* USB 3.0 headers are unnecessary unless OP really needs to use high-speed storage on the front ports. They're nice if you use them, but OP asked for most bang for buck.
* The motherboard only has two RAM slots, so 1x8GB makes more sense here. Not to mention there are slightly cheaper RAM options available.
* Hybrid drives are kinda cool, but again it runs counter to the most-bang-for-buck goal.
* That is a very expensive case for a build so focused on performance per dollar.
* 600W is a lot for this build. An i3-4170 and GTX 960 would be more than safe on a 400W PSU, especially if OP doesn't intend to overclock the GPU. It's not bad to be insured for future upgrades, however.Even if for some reason you refuse to use the mail-in rebates, this build is still a few bucks cheaper than /u/Kusibu's while being substantially better performance-wise. I think it's pretty overkill for all of the games you listed, but it's the best $600 build, including monitor, that I can come up with.

* An i5-4460 will play 99.9% of games smoothly and will probably not need an upgrade for several years.
* You don't really need any features from your motherboard that the H81 chipset can't offer, so here's a cheap, reliable option.
* I've never seen RAM this cheap before. Granted, it's after a rebate, but damn DDR3 getting cheap these days.
* Standard 1TB HDD. Not much else to say here.
* Unquestionably the best new graphics card you can get in this price range. Even without the rebate I would still recommend this card over anything else near its price.
* Budget mid tower with two pre-installed fans.
* Solid budget PSU with modular cables. And before any circlejerkers come by and cry about how the CX series isn't the SuperNOVA G2 series (of course it's not), [here](http://www.eteknix.com/corsair-cx500m-semi-modular-power-supply/) is a review to back it up, as well as [this](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/power-supply-review-80-plus-bronze,3587-5.html) review of the non-modular version.
* 1080p IPS monitor for $100 with free shipping from Best Buy.

I threw in an optical drive so you don't have to worry about installing Windows via USB, since you're new. If you don't mind doing that, and you don't have any other uses for the drive, by all means skip it. I know someone is going to wonder why I picked 16GB RAM instead of 8GB, but Battlefront is a particularly RAM-intensive game, so I figured why not. This RAM is stupidly cheap anyway. The i5-4460/R9 390 combo should get you ultra settings in any game at 1080p currently.

Are you trying to spend close to your budget, or are you okay with saving money? A reasonably cost-effective $800-900 build (including OS) should be able to play anything on ultra in 1080p. Go up by about $350 and you've got a solid 1440p build, and that leaves enough room for a good 1440p monitor (~$250).My recommendation:

* Assemble the least expensive build that meets OP's requirements.
* Choose the best possible PC that OP can afford.

I just wanted to make sure you are aware that this budget gives you those options.Usually, motherboards don't have built-in Wi-Fi unless they're very small (mITX). This is because typically Wi-Fi capabilities are achieved using a PCIe (or USB) wireless adapter, and mITX mobos don't have enough PCIe slots for an adapter. If I were you I would get the motherboard I listed above, as well as a wireless adapter like [this one](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-wireless-network-card-gcwb867di). Although, you may want to do some research on wireless cards to make sure you're getting the best one for your connection type and speed.The only differences are the motherboard, RAM, and case. The only thing I would change in the build I gave you is the RAM, since the one I recommended isn't on sale anymore. The only reason I recommended a more expensive case to the other guy was because he "prefers minimalism." If you like that case, you're welcome to pick it instead. There's certainly room in the budget. I just try to always pick the least expensive options.

USB 3.0 headers aren't especially important since the faster speed only matters for things like external drives, and if you have those, you can always use the back ports. If OP really needs USB 3.0 speed in the front, there's still no reason to go all the way to H97. That would be a waste of money.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-05 15:01 EST-0500 |Because it's more than enough for the games you listed. The only important difference between a slightly overclocked G3258 and an i3 is that the i3 has hyperthreading, which adds two "virtual cores." These will help moderately in very few specific scenarios (GTA 5, Witcher 3), but in those scenarios, you'd probably want an i5 anyway. Both the i3 and the Pentium use the same motherboard socket, so you might as well save the money for the future i5 upgrade, if you ever need it. Yes, I think it should get high (not ultra) settings in all of those games. &gt; Just curious, why would I need 3.0 speed in the front?

If you have external HDDs or SSDs, or if you frequently use USB 3.0 flash drives, and you particularly need to use the front ports instead of the rear ones mounted on the motherboard.

&gt; Also, do you reccomend I get an Ssd?

SSDs are nice, but they're not necessary. I wouldn't buy an SSD if it meant a significant performance hit elsewhere. A 120GB SSD (~$45) is enough for your OS, which will make your PC start up faster, and a 240GB SSD will also have room for some games, which will make loading screens faster.

&gt; And what do you think of the detective420blazing's setup

* The H97 motherboard is unnecessary. The H97 chipset offers little over the more basic H81 and B85 motherboards, which have all the features most people need. I own the H97 Anniversary (the full-size version of what he has listed), and I wish I had spent less on it.
* The R9 380 is a tier below the R9 390 and will get you high, not ultra, settings in the more demanding titles. I also definitely don't agree with the choice to get the 4GB version of the 380. Not only are there cheaper 4GB versions available than what he chose, but the 2GB version will perform exactly the same 99.9% of the time if you're playing in 1080p.
* The case he picked is definitely more budget-friendly. The Define S is a very high-quality case that's easy to build in and does wonders for noise reduction. But if you don't care about that, by all means pick the cheaper option.
* The 650G2 that I recommended is a top-tier power supply. Nothing near this price beats it. If I were you, I would buy the 650G2 right away. Like, tonight. No sense in waiting. Seriously.
* The monitor he picked is a good monitor, but 1080p IPS monitors can be had for substantially less.
* I just realized I didn't include a keyboard and mouse. The CM one he recommended is fine, although personally I would go for a more basic one like the Logitech MK120.

Here's a build that will perform virtually equal to his build, with more cost-effective parts:

Skylake offers very little over Haswell, and in my opinion it isn't worth the price premium.

&gt; The PSU is ok, but there are quite a few better on the market, with better energy efficiency rating

The NEX (G1) series is pretty [mediocre](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=442), but not because of its efficiency. The quality of a power supply has little to do with its efficiency rating and more to do with things like voltage regulation and ripple suppression. The [650G2](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220g20650y1) is substantially cheaper after rebate (due to a current sale) and also a [top-of-the-line](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story&amp;reid=429) unit. /u/YinAska, I recommend that you jump on this deal ASAP. Like, tonight.In that case I think you ought to drop the 980 Ti and get a more 1080p-oriented card.

http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/antec-vp450-power-supply-review/

Also, the FX-6300 bundle from Micro Center is a better deal than that i3, and the R7 265 is cheaper than a 750 Ti and will perform better.1440p, 165Hz, G-Sync, IPS. I know, I know.&gt; an SSD for my OS would be niceNot sure why you're getting downvoted. You're not wrong.I get that there's a lot of temptation to get things OP doesn't need, just because there's a big budget. And I get that there's temptation to go overboard on some components[ just because other stuff in the build is also top-of-the-line](http://jamesclear.com/diderot-effect). But you're over budget, and you didn't include a keyboard and mouse.

* An overclocked 4690K is still more than enough for gaming and streaming and will last for years. There's no magical rule that says two 980 Ti's need to be paired with an over-the-top processor.
* That motherboard is very expensive.
* OP only needed an SSD for the OS. This being a $5000 build doesn't make a 500GB SSD any more appropriate than a 120GB one.
* OP doesn't care at all about aesthetics. I get that most enthusiast builds like this tend to also look cool, but I think we ought to try to resist shaping the build to our own preferences instead of OP's. No matter the budget, we should still be trying to pick cost-effective parts to put the money in places where it'll make a difference.Do those cases really have better airflow? I don't have much personal experience with $30 cases, but the FBM-02 does have two pre-installed fans.* The NEX series of PSUs is mediocre, and if OP intends to overclock, 750W may be cutting it a bit close.
* You picked a FreeSync-enabled monitor but an Nvidia GPU.Here's one with a 1440p 144Hz G-Sync monitor. A single 980 Ti won't be able to handle demanding games at this frame rate, but you can add another 980 Ti either right away or whenever your budget allows.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-06 12:42 EST-0500 |I wasn't referring to overclocking the Xeon. Regardless, the G1 series should be avoided for any build when there are plenty of better options at the same price.What exactly is "this kind of build"? It's no different from any other gaming build, except that OP wants to play on a high-resolution, high-refresh monitor. Nothing about wanting to game with better graphics suggests that a Skylake i7 or larger SSD is necessary. 

And I know that I'm splitting the thinnest of hairs here. Personally, I would rather have the 500GB SSD than the 120GB one. But OP was pretty clear with the request for an OS drive. This is something I see a lot on this sub -- people making upgrades where they are unnecessary, just because there are very high-end components elsewhere in the build.Fair enough. Is this better? Looks like the rebate on the 265 ended. I went ahead and dropped the SSD since it no longer fits after rebates.

Maybe /u/bubajofe ought to clarify what was meant here. I didn't take this to mean Twitch streaming.I'm well aware, but if OP only intends to install an OS on it, that's still $20-30 wasted (it's actually more like $40).This is precisely the logic I don't think I will ever understand. Nothing about having a larger budget suggests to me that we need to go overboard in areas that OP doesn't care about.I'd go with 1x8GB RAM to save room for a possible future upgrade. Good build.

Edit: Actually, I don't really see any reason why OP shouldn't just reuse his current stick. /u/-Caesar, why do you need to replace your RAM?I have some edits to this build, along with some questions.

* ~~Does hyperthreading make much of a difference in Lightroom? I know it makes a difference with video editing, but for photos I'm not convinced. I left the Xeon alone because I'm assuming you know more than I do about this, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask.~~ It looks like the Xeon should help with the music stuff anyway.
* Good call on the Z97 for SATA ports. I probably wouldn't have caught that.
* Why the expensive RAM? It's gotten really cheap lately.
* Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't the 950 PRO be a better choice than the Intel 750? The motherboard you picked has an M.2 port, and the 950 PRO is both cheaper and larger. Is the Intel faster or something?
* Is there an advantage to WD Reds that make them more attractive than faster, cheaper 2TB HDDs?
* I'd pick the PCS+ 390 over the XFX one. I own the XFX one, and I wish I had picked up one with a better, quieter cooler. It's also a bit cheaper.
* Picking a full tower is always so easy. At $100, it seems like a no-brainer to get the Enthoo Pro.
* It's a shame the sale on the G2 ended. The S12II, however, is still available at its standard price, and it's a [high-quality unit](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story&amp;reid=185). 
* I don't think there are any features unique to Windows 10 Pro that OP needs, so I'm pretty skeptical on that, but I'll leave that alone because OP requested it.

Your friend is misinformed. AMD and Nvidia trade blows at various price points, so any assertion that Nvidia is flat-out superior are biased and should not be trusted. Here's a cheaper alternative to /u/Kusibu's build that will perform virtually the same.

* i5-4460 performs within 3% of the i5-4590 and is $22 (~10%) cheaper.
* No need for a hybrid drive. You could add in a 120GB SSD if you really want to, with the savings from other components.
* I'm not convinced that the 4GB 380 has any important advantages over the 2GB 380 at 1080p, and even if there were any, I doubt it would be worth $50 (~25%) more.
* Cheaper case, although if you like the one he recommended I have no issues with it.
* Less expensive power supply with [good reviews](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story&amp;reid=351).

The build will get you high (not ultra) settings in more demanding games. You can almost fit in an R9 390 for ultra settings, but that would be very close to (probably slightly over) your $1000 budget, and if you need wiggle room for taxes, it's definitely a no-go.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-06 16:33 EST-0500 |Do not buy an i5-4690. The i5-4460 performs within 10% and is more than 10% cheaper. Either go with the 4460 or get a 4690K and overclock it. Anything in between makes little sense.The Z97 motherboard is only necessary if you get the i5-4690K, since it can be overclocked but requires an OC-compatible motherboard. I highly recommend just getting an i5-4460. Best performance per dollar for this upgrade, hands down.* Skylake offers very little over Haswell and isn't worth the price difference. An i5-4690K, Z97 motherboard, and 16GB DDR3 RAM will cost altogether around $375. An i5-6600K, Z170 motherboard, and 16GB DDR4 RAM will cost about $500. That's a 33% increase in cost for a marginal increase in performance per clock. You'd be paying for novelty.
* ~~The CPU cooler /u/Du6e picked out is great (also one of the quietest, if not the quietest), but expensive CPU coolers are only necessary if you want very aggressive overclocks. A $30 cooler is already enough to get overclocks well over 4.0GHz, so spending $30 more for an extra few hundred MHz (at best) isn't cost-effective.~~ Just noticed he switched it to a 212 EVO in the second iteration. The 212 EVO is by far the most popular cooler, but the H7 I recommended beats it in every way while being around the same price excluding rebates. It's also slightly easier to install. Either one is fine, though.
* The 850 EVO is a very popular SSD. However, the advantages it has over budget SSDs are imperceptible outside of benchmarks. I will never understand why people get snobby about SSD read/write speeds when 99% of applications are not sensitive to those speeds. The SSD I picked is 20% cheaper, and you'll never be able to tell the difference.
* His build does not have a power supply that can handle multiple 980 Ti's. I've made sure to give you a quality PSU with enough juice for SLI if you need it.
* The monitor I picked has a refresh rate of 144Hz with G-Sync, which will look very smooth in games where you can achieve that frame rate. Two 980 Ti's will be able to hit 100 FPS in pretty much any game out there right now. His monitor is 60Hz without G-Sync, although it is an IPS panel, which is nice. However, the Acer G257HU is around $250 and is also a 1440p 60Hz IPS panel, so I don't know why you would spend $400 for a slightly larger monitor with the same main features.I don't see any reason why you shouldn't reuse your current RAM. Just go with /u/Du6e's suggestion and skip the memory. 

If there's any way you could get your hands on a used i5-2500 or i5-2500K, you could reuse your motherboard as well. The second-generation Intel chips aren't very far off from even the newest generation. An i5-2500 will perform more or less the same as an i5-4460 or i5-6500. If reusing your motherboard is an option I see no reason why you shouldn't take it. The only difference between an i5 and an i7 is that i7's have hyperthreading enabled. Hyperthreading is great for highly parallelized tasks such as video rendering and certain types of CAD work, but for gaming there are very few cases of it actually making a difference. 

What makes this a bit tricky is that DirectX 12 could potentially change this by being able to take advantage of hyperthreading. However, since no DX12-compatible games have been released yet, any assertion that i7's will soon have tangible gaming benefits over i5's is only speculation. It's currently unclear how well Star Citizen (a DX12-compatible game) will benefit, if at all, from hyperthreading, but I'm going to guess that an i5 will be more than enough. If I recall correctly, I read somewhere on the Star Citizen forums that an i5-2500 was recommended for the game. 

My gut says that an i5 is just fine for the game, and if you want to be extra sure, you're probably better off getting an overclockable i5 (and overclocking it) than getting an i7. Of course, an overclockable i7 like the 4790K is the best of both worlds, but it's also very expensive. Here's a little summary of the four quad-core CPUs I think you ought to be considering right now (assuming you can't find an i5-2xxx and reuse your current mobo). 

* Core i5-4460: No hyperthreading, no overclocking
* Core i5-4690K: No hyperthreading, overclockable
* Xeon E3-1230 V3: Hyperthreading, no overclocking 
* Core i7-4790K: Hyperthreading, overclockable

The one that may seem odd to you is the Xeon. It's just an i7-4770 without integrated graphics. The lack of integrated graphics makes it cheaper and doesn't matter because you'll have a dedicated graphics card anyway. If I were you, I would stick to an i5. 

Edit: it's also worth noting that if your current OS isn't upgradeable to Windows 10 you're going to want to get Win10. DirectX 12 is a Windows 10 exclusive, and you're going to want to play Star Citizen with DX12.You were probably thinking of Battlefront. &gt; I am looking to build a gaming rig that can run AAA titles at 1440p 144hz/fps on ultra settings.

I don't know if any rig could do this, to be honest. Even two 980 Ti's would have trouble doing this in a lot of games. 

-------------------------------------

Here's one with a single 980 Ti with room for a second, as well as a G-Sync monitor.

If you plan to put more than just your OS on the SSD I'd recommend getting one that's a bit bigger. Plus the larger ones cost less per GB.

&gt; since liquid cooling is quieter (I've read) i would like it

This is debatable. There are some very quiet air coolers out there, and liquid cooling seems unnecessary if you have no plans to overclock.

&gt; In the future, i would like to run another identical card in SLI once the price runs down, i would upgrade the PSU when i buy the second card, so that isn't a bother, but i would like the motherboard to be able to support it so i don't have to reapply the CPU

I don't think you realize how generous your budget is.

I'd go with an i7 or Xeon if you're doing CAD work. Since you're also interested in overclocking, the Xeon is out of the picture.

&gt; was thinking somewhere between 16-32gb

16GB is the maximum for fourth-generation (Haswell) Intel mITX motherboards, since DDR3 is 8GB maximum per slot and mITX boards only have two slots. You'd have to go with a more expensive sixth-generation (Skylake) board to get 32GB.

&gt; WiFi is required

Most mITX motherboards have built-in Wi-Fi, since PCIe network cards aren't an option if you have a graphics card.

&gt; SLI/Crossfire isn't needed

It's neither necessary nor possible. mITX boards aren't large enough for multiple GPUs.

I'd suggest upgrading a bit further, but the next tier of GPUs is out of reach on your budget. You can either add an SSD or just keep the extra cash. I would absolutely *not* sacfrifice performance for an SSD. Framerate &gt; load/boot times. And you don't even have to compromise, since you can fit in an i5 and an SSD if you just don't get the 4GB 380 as /u/xFrostbite13x suggested. I'm not convinced that the 4GB 380 has any significant advantages over the 2GB version at 1080p, and if any exist, they're not worth the price difference.

And the 390 is about equivalent to an overclocked 970.

However, the assertion that liquid cooling is necessary for the best overclocks is incorrect. Liquid cooling is overpriced, as the best air coolers [outperform](http://www.hitechlegion.com/reviews/cooling/heatsinks/39900-cryorig-r1-ultimate-cpu-cooler-review?showall=&amp;limitstart=) AIO coolers at lower costs. They're also quieter at maximum speed. The only downside to a top-tier air cooler with respect to AIO liquid coolers is that they are very large, but this shouldn't matter in a build of this size.

As for how to overclock, the resources /u/Du6e provided are great. I also recommend /r/overclocking, as they have everything you could possibly need in their sidebar.

EDIT: Forgot to address the mechanical keyboard thing.

It'll get 100+ FPS in all but the most demanding of games, but if you want a solid 100+ FPS in any game, you'll need two GPUs. It's worth noting that the second build, with two Furies and a FreeSync monitor, will likely get &gt;100 FPS in 99% of games at 1440p while costing a lot less than two 980 Ti's and a G-Sync monitor.* CPU with hyperthreading for productivity and possibly highly threaded games in the future. No overclocking this CPU but in my opinion overclocking your CPU so wouldn't be worth the price.
* 16GB RAM for multitasking and productivity.
* R9 390 for ultra settings in any current games.

You should be fine, unless you like having a lot of background programs running while gaming. Either way, I've picked a B85 motherboard so you have some extra RAM slots to use if you need them, since your current RAM is 2x4GB.

&gt; I would prefer to keep with Intel processors and Nvidia graphic cards but I'm open to suggestions.

Intel's definitely the way to go, currently, with CPUs. For ultra graphics settings, you're going to want either a GTX 970 or an R9 390, and the 390 actually outperforms the 970 unless you plan to overclock, in which case they're pretty equal. And the 8GB of VRAM may prove useful eventually.

&gt; Would it be advisable to have a second backup hard drive as well?

That depends all on you. Personally I wouldn't consider 250GB enough for OS, applications, and file storage, especially considering that you shouldn't use more than 80% of your SSD's capacity. But if you can make it work, by all means go for it.

If by "run it" you meant "game on it" then I'd say no. Otherwise, yes, as the 390 can drive displays at 4K resolution.

&gt; Which specific CPU would you recommend instead?

I would recommend the i5-4460 or, if you plan to overclock, the i5-4690K. Here's one with a 4690K, which should perform very close to the previous build at lower cost.

The OS can be installed by downloading the Windows .iso and putting it on a thumb drive. There are plenty of guides detailing how to do this.

This means that the front ports would be operating at USB 2.0 speeds instead of USB 3.0. There are still ports mounted on the motherboard (the ones accessible from the back of the case) that have USB 3.0. The only things that really care about those speeds are flash drives and external HDDs and SSDs, so if you didn't have USB 3.0 headers but needed to use those drives, you could just plug them into the back. If for some reason you need to plug them into the front, it's not really that much more expensive anyway:

I wouldn't go any further than a 390 if your intent is to play in 1080p. What monitor are you reusing?There's no reason to get a more expensive motherboard unless you have an overclockable CPU. The one I recommended has all the features you need, so why spend more money? Spending more isn't going to make performance any better.

This is unnecessary if you don't plan to overclock, and overclocking your CPU will have minimal benefits for gaming, regardless of resolution.

&gt; Also plan to use a super high res monitor down the line.

Why not right now? Your budget is more generous than you think. Here's a 1440p gaming build with a 1440p monitor.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-11-10 12:52 EST-0500 |The PowerColor PCS+ one has been as low as $275 after rebate. To be honest I'm not sure why people get so snobby about the MSI and Sapphire ones. All else equal I'd probably grab the Sapphire, but the PCS+ cooler is fantastic and highly underrated. I own the XFX DD Black Edition and wish I had gotten the PCS+ one for the better, quieter cooler. However, this deal on the MSI one is really good, so if you're looking to buy soon then I see no reason why you shouldn't jump on this. But in general, I would pick the cheapest option between the PowerColor, MSI, and Sapphire cards. It's a giant heatsink at a good price. No heatsink-only cooler would be good enough for overclocking, but for someone who's got a locked Intel and is very concerned with silence, you can't beat fanless.&gt; Although a video card that's 6x the price and 3x the size of the Mobo is freaking me out a little, lol.

Trim the fat from where you don't need it, and pour your money where you'll actually see performance gains.

&gt; 4590 vs. 4460 vs. 4690?

They're all going to have virtually the same performance. Just get what's cheapest.[PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/xvBHCJ) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/xvBHCJ/by_merchant/)

Just different parts because there are different sales going on, and a bit cheaper because prices have dropped. The builds will perform exactly the same.My graphics card is a tier below this one (R9 390) and I can run Fallout 4 with a couple of graphical mods (textures, lighting) just fine in 1080p. With this card you ought to be able to get away with more mods than I can.I'm sure that's why he said "most Christians." And that's probably not even True for most Christians, just the ones this particular person has come across. For me it's not "most Christians" but it's still an unacceptably high proportion. No, the point isn't to say that only religion causes people to do these things, just that it's one of the major sources. People love to find justifications for doing terrible things, and religious dogma is one of the places people often find those justifications.Sorry, I forgot to respond to your other comment.

The CPU is clocked 100MHz lower (about 3% slower), but the GPU is better stock speeds, and the PSU is more reliable. With this you may be able to squeeze in a 144Hz monitor.

It can be helpful to buy parts over the course of a week or two while keeping an eye out for good deals, but much sooner than that it doesn't make much sense to recommend a part list.I was just trying to meet the minimum requirements for both MGSV and SFV. MGSV has a quad-core i5 listed as a minimum. However, I'll concede that the R7 265 probably isn't enough for SFV, as it lists a the GTX 480 as a minimum, which is a tad above a 265.

I just built my first PC a few months ago with some summer internship money. Definitely one of the most gratifying things I've done. Good luck with your new job!Well, all the more reason never to trust developers' PC specs. Disregard my suggestions, /u/cmbsfm.I've been recommending the 850W HCG M in a lot of builds recently. An 850W PSU of that quality, for $69.99, with free shipping, and *without rebate*? It was already a pretty awesome deal, and now it even comes with a free speaker. That's pretty nuts.Happy cakeday! Here's one that pushes your budget and, in my opinion, is pretty overkill. This is more of a 1440p build.

As for the part list, the SSD in the second build is an exceptionally good deal on a 240GB SSD, so I'd pick that up ASAP if you can. Same with the PSU. The 850W HCG M is a rock solid PSU, and it's a great deal at $70 with free shipping and no mail-in rebate. That deal has been running for a few days, and I would pick it up right now in case it ends soon. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/3nxp93/psu_antec_hcg850m_modular_850w_6999/) is some discussion if you're skeptical. You can even get a free speaker with it, due to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/3nwlgh/speaker_buy_any_antec_hcg_m_series_psu_between/) other promo, which ends in five days. The rest of the parts aren't exceptional deals, so no rush on those, but if your budget permits it I would get those two things as soon as possible (unless you want a bigger SSD or something).Good deals are constantly popping up all over the place, so feel free to send me another message closer to when you purchase so I can make sure you're getting the most out of your money. I'm pretty active on this sub and on /r/buildapcsales, so I stay pretty current.If you're not going to be purchasing for a month or two, then it would make more sense to ask for a part list then and not now. We'd be able to use whatever deals are available at that point in time. However, if you're just looking for some idea of what it might look like, based on current prices, here's my suggestion:

Not that the 500B is *bad*, but I would err on the side of caution and get a 600B or a high-quality PSU.* I think the G3258 is a better buy than an i3 if OP plans to upgrade anyway. However, OP did specifically ask for an i3.
* I don't see why you picked RAM that costs $10 more when there's no practical difference between mine and yours. 
* The R7 265 and the R7 370 are the same GPU, with the 370 being clocked 100MHz higher at stock. If we're already talking about switching to a G3258 (which ought to be overclocked to make it worth it), then OP could just as easily overclock the 265 to at least the same level as a 370. Either way, I don't think the 370 is worth an extra $40.
* I picked an ATX case in case OP ever wants to upgrade his CPU and get an ATX motherboard. The price of the Core 1100 will end up being higher if you factor in the cost of shipping, so I'm not sure what the advantage is there.
* If I were OP, I would get something more like this:

But in gaming, there will be zero performance difference between the fastest RAM and the slowest. If you can show me a benchmark in which faster RAM had more than a 0.1 FPS advantage over slower RAM (which is still small enough to be mere coincidence), and convince me that this difference is worth paying 30% more for RAM, then I'll consider myself corrected. 

I won't fight you on the case thing. It just depends whether OP wants a smaller or larger case, I suppose. It's a little ambiguous from your post, so do you need an OS? If not, here's one that's a bit over budget before rebates and a bit under after them. I could've gone with an i3 and slightly more powerful graphics card, but the i5 will last you for a very long time without upgrading, whereas buying a new GPU is easy as long as your PSU can handle it.

I think you can do better than a 970 in this build, but I'll leave that discussion alone and work with what you gave. Here's one that preserves the black/red theme, has no compatibility issues, and is ready for a second 970 should you choose to add another for SLI. I know you didn't ask for an SSD but I threw one in anyway because I know I would want one.

As for the CPU, if OP doesn't intend to overclock (and there would be no need to), then the G3250 is just as fast at a lower price tag.The size of your case isn't a concern unless (a) your motherboard won't fit, or (b) you need good airflow because you have power-hungry and/or overclocked GPU. If you ever plan to get a Full ATX motherboard, it may make sense to have a larger case, but there's no reason to go Full ATX over Micro ATX unless you need lots of PCI-e lanes for SLI or something. If you plan to overclock your GPU (or get an aggressively factory overclocked one like the R9 390), then you may want more room for airflow (although this may also require a PSU upgrade). The GTX 900 series has very conservative stock clock speeds and highly efficient architecture, so you won't be having any problems with heat on a GTX 950 unless you overclock it heavily.

As for modular PSUs, they're nice because you can choose to use only the power connectors that you need for your system, whereas for non-modular units all of the cables are permanently attached. This means that with a non-modular PSU you have to keep the unused cables tied up somewhere in your case, preferably out of the way of fans and other components. A minor inconvenience, usually, but modular PSUs are nice for that reason.Ah, the anonymous downvote. Does anyone care to explain why this was worthy of a downvote? Perhaps we can have a healthy discussion so I don't make the same mistake in the future when recommending builds. Not to mention that seeing detailed discussion will only help the OP make a better decision.

&gt; Rather than downvoting 'bad builds', take a moment to reply with some reasons why the build is bad.Had to go a bit over, but here you go.

&gt; Rather than downvoting 'bad builds', take a moment to reply with some reasons *why* the build is bad. 

We're trying to help OP here. If you have a better idea, post it. And we're a community that's supposed to be able to give good advice, so if I'm doing something wrong, tell me so I won't do it again. Updated with suggestions from /u/Kyle_Pq and /u/somesortofusername. I wasn't able to fit in an SSD, but I think that's the most logical place to make a cut. I did originally have 16GB in the build, but I cut it down to make room for the Wi-Fi adapter. I suppose it does make more sense to downgrade the graphics card instead. I wasn't sure how much RAM is required for programming.

The last thing most of us want to do is give bad advice, so if you're going to downvote us, at least help us out and start a healthy discussion about it.There's a never-ending debate between those two cards on this subreddit (and related subs). The truth is that they're both fantastic cards, and you wouldn't be making any mistakes by getting either one. However, most people who are familiar with the two agree that, in general, you're getting better performance per dollar with the 390:

* The 390 is more aggressively factory overclocked, which means that its performance will, for most games, equal that of a moderately overclocked 970.
* The 970's more conservative stock speed means that it has more overclocking headroom than the 390. You might be able to squeeze an extra 10-15% out of a 390, whereas you might get 30-40% extra out of the 970. When both are overclocked, the performance difference between the two is a lot smaller.
* The 390 has less efficient architecture than the 970, meaning that even when 970 is overclocked to match the performance of the 390, it will draw less power and generate less heat than the 390. However, this difference is very slight, and people often exaggerate this point.
* The biggest advantage of the 390 is that it has 8GB of VRAM, compared to the 3.5GB of the 970. I say 3.5GB and not 4GB because Nvidia is a bit guilty of a form of False advertising with the 970. While it technically does have 4GB, the last 0.5GB was found, after release, to be much slower than the rest of the VRAM and left unused by many applications. This was a highly controversial topic after it was discovered. The 8GB of VRAM that the 390 has, many argue, is unnecessary. Currently, that is True. The only games that might use more than 3.5GB of VRAM are Shadow of Mordor and highly modded Skyrim. However, future games will inevitably use more VRAM, especially since we'll probably be seeing 16GB HBM2 graphics cards next year.
* There is some speculation, due to DirectX 12 benchmarks, that AMD cards will perform better than Nvidia's current generation of graphics cards in DX12 games, due to their support for asynchronous compute. This is still speculation, and DX12 games are still a very long way from being mainstream.

Again, let me reiterate, the 970 is a fantastic card. But if you see lots of people being nitpicky about the 390 being better than the 970, it's because we want you to get the most out of your money. The difference is small, but based on the information we currently have, there is a difference. The 390 is a card that few know about because they default to Nvidia cards. It's not their fault that they do this. It used to make a lot of sense to default to Nvidia. However, at a lot of price points, AMD cards are more bang for your buck, and I want to make sure you're aware of that option.Higher factory overclocking means the manufacturer overclocks the card before selling it. Nvidia and AMD make reference versions of the graphics cards, after which companies like EVGA and Sapphire modify them with custom PCBs, heatsinks, and coolers and change their core clock frequencies (AKA factory overclocking). If you're someone who wants the benefits (and drawbacks) of a moderate overclock, but don't want to do the work yourself, getting a factory overclocked card like the 390 makes sense. Higher factory overclocks are, in my opinion, the reason AMD cards have better stock performance, greater power consumption, and higher temperatures at many price points. 

I'm not a WoW player, but my intuition tells me that a 970 or 390 would be pretty overkill, even just to get a stable framerate. I'll do the research when I get home, but I suspect you can go pretty far down the food chain and still be safe. How's do you like this one?

* Over budget, unfortunately, but you had some pretty specific requirements and did say the budget was a bit flexible.
* Went with the R4, which is a great case despite not being an R5.
* R9 285 seems a bit out of place in this build, but you mentioned that the GPU isn't the highest priority at the moment.

The PCS+ is a really good cooler. Unless you need black and red for some reason, I say just pick this one up. Even a quality 550W PSU is enough. System peak power consumption stays in the low to mid 400's, even when everything is overclocked. The XFX TS 550W is on sale right now, I think. I got an EVGA 650W GS with my 390, and i think it's pretty overkill. Ah, yeah I've heard. I forgot that I had put that in this build. I was just swapping the GPU and RAM. I'm on mobile right now (actually teaching a class, haha) so I can't update it. Would you mind?

The CPU would benefit a lot from being overclocked, and overclocking your GPU directly helps gaming performance in a lot of games. Granted, this PSU is only $25 after rebate, so you're not in the hole by much even if you need to replace that too.Won't perform as well as /u/Du6e's build, but I thought I'd have some fun with it and try to build around a really small case.

The two are identical, except that the G3258 is unlocked, meaning it can be overclocked. It's something you only have to do once, and it only takes a few minutes. Overclocking the G3258 doesn't require buying a new cooler, as it can be clocked to 4.0GHz easily on the stock cooler, which is a 25% increase in CPU performance. It's still only a dual-core CPU, so it will have issues with games that are meant for four cores, but for any game that doesn't need more than two cores, an overclocked G3258 will perform as well as any CPU out there. For only about $15 more than the locked version, I'd say it's worth it. 

And again, feel free to post again right before you purchase. Pay attention to /r/buildapcsales, too, since there may be a really good deal that's worth jumping on before everything else. You're welcome to send me PMs if you don't know if something is a good deal, or if you want me to put together an updated list. Are H1Z1 and CS:GO the only games you plan to play, or do you want a PC that can max out any game? Here's one that should be able to get ultra settings on any game out right now. I wasn't able to fit in a CPU overclocking setup but I figured that was the least important part.

Here's one with an unlocked CPU, but I had to drop the SSD to fit it in, and it's still a bit over budget before rebates. I've heard H1Z1 is a pretty CPU-intensive game, but I'm not sure how necessary the overclocking is to you.

Is that something you intend to do in the future? If so I'll need to upgrade more than just the PSU.I'm sure it wouldn't benchmark well at all against "good" SSDs, but what I'm saying is that "in benchmarks" is the only context in which most people would ever notice a difference. Outside of benchmarks, if you're coming from mechanical hard drives, comparing SSD speeds is like comparing a Lamborghini to a Ferrari when all you have is a Camry.You could just get a [390](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/powercolor-video-card-axr93908gbd5ppdhe).Either way, ask me to update the list on the day you purchase.

&gt; I\u2019d like to run at ultra settings if possible. The PC will be driving a 34\u201d 3440x1440 monitor.

Ultra settings at 3440x1440 is gonna be a little rough, but a 980 Ti should do it in most games. The more graphically intense ones will struggle.

I find it hard to believe that the game will benefit much, if at all, from an i7 versus an i5. If you want to be extra safe about that recommended spec, I recommend getting an unlocked i5 and overclocking it. It's probably just the clock speed (3.6 GHz) that's relevant there.

But what's with the two 144Hz monitors? It doesn't really make sense to me to game on two monitors instead of one or three, unless there's something I just don't know about. Also, a 980 Ti is extremely overkill for what OP asked for, which is 1080p at 60 FPS. And the power supply is a bit extreme, considering the motherboard you picked isn't SLI-capable anyway. I get that OP gave us a big budget to work with here, but I think you got a little trigger-happy with this one.In case you just aren't aware you don't need to spend $3000 on this, here's a cost-effective option that is still more than enough to do what you described at 1080p.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-23 02:54 EDT-0400 |Where did OP mention video editing or CAD?How so? System power consumption will top out in the 400's, won't it? 620W seems like more than enough to me.Good call. I'll try to be more careful when choosing parts from CPL in the future. Edited the build.Technically the manufacturer recommends 750W, but that's probably just to avoid liability when people get crappy PSUs. At least if they buy a bad unit, it's terribly overpowered anyway.

Even a quality 500-550W PSU is enough to power a 390, even when both the CPU and GPU are overclocked. As I said, power consumption will typically top out in the 300's for a 390 system, maybe the 400's when overclocked. Relevant reviews [here](http://www.eteknix.com/sapphire-nitro-r9-390-8gb-graphics-card-review/14/), [here](http://www.legitreviews.com/sapphire-nitro-r9-390-8gb-nitro-r9-380-4gb-video-card-review_166123/11), and [here](http://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/zardon/sapphire-r9-390-nitro-8gb-review/22/).

The 620W HCG-M is a quality SeaSonic PSU (S12II) that will have no trouble with pretty much any single-GPU setup out there. I bought the GS 650W with my 390, and I now know that's pretty overkill.Oh, okay. I was just confused because you said the second build was for if they "change their mind." I thought I had missed something.&gt; I doubt that even if the CPU and GPU are overclocked that would still be the case

OC reviews [here](http://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/1986-amd-r9-390-r9-380-overclocking-benchmark/Page-2) and [here](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2015-amd-radeon-r9-390-8gb-review). Obviously max system power draw depends on what the rest of the system looks like, but I'm pretty confident that OP's build here won't even get close to 500W. Not to mention a lot of these tests in reviews are done with hardcore stress testing, which doesn't reflect the conditions you'd see when gaming.

&gt; It's usually better to get a little more wattage than you need

I agree, and that's why I leaned toward 650W when I got my 390, but I think it would be incorrect to say that 600W is necessary for a typical 390 setup, even when overclocking. &gt; When I do but one, I was looking to get a 960.

If I may, I recommend the [R9 380](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/powercolor-video-card-axr93804gbd5ppdhe) instead. It will perform better, especially since you aren't planning to overclock anything.

Here, I've trimmed some of the fat from your build. You can spend the difference on a new SSD or put it toward your GPU and/or speakers later. Or you can just put it in your pocket.

I'm well aware that some games are able to make some use of four or more threads, and that the Witcher 3 is one of them. But it still seems likely to me that an i5 with a higher clock speed will fare better than an i7/Xeon with a lower clock speed, even if the game does benefit marginally from eight threads. Of course this is all speculation at this point, as the game hasn't been released yet, but this wouldn't be the first time a game developer has listed an i7 in the recommended specifications when that didn't actually make any sense.

&gt; the Z97 actually costs about 120$, not sure why it shows 84$.

There's a $30 mail-in rebate. I assume you don't like those and disabled them on PCPP.

&gt; the difference between R9 390 and 390x is very minimal

There are mixed results on this topic, but in general I'm inclined to agree with you. I just picked the rest of the build out first and chose the best GPU I could find while remaining within budget. I was trying my best to meet my interpretation of the listed recommended specifications, which listed a 290X.

&gt; OP said he is not interested in overclocking, so why shove OC build on him?

I'm not shoving anything on him. He asked for suggestions, and listed Fallout 4's recommended specs. He didn't flat out say he was not going to overclock, just "probably not." If I have a compelling reason to try to convince him to overclock, I should at least make that an option. I saw that Bethesda recommended a 3.6GHz processor, so I went with my gut, which told me that a higher clock will beat a higher core count.

-------------------

If you really think that a hyperthreading-enabled CPU will be more beneficial than convincing OP to moderately overclock an i5, then here's how I would change my build. I also took it down to a 390 and picked a cheaper PSU.

Edit: Didn't see that you had already posted a build. Looks like we had more or less the same idea.

Even the video you linked video shows a small advantage to the 380, and from mine it's pretty clear that in most games you need to overclock the 960 to put it on par with a stock 380. And this makes sense given that AMD cards are typically factory overclocked more aggressively than Nvidia ones. If you overclock both cards to their limits, they'll perform much closer to one another. I have nothing against the 960, but given that the cheapest 380 is typically $20 cheaper than the cheapest 960, and that OP has no intent to overclock either one, the 380 makes more sense as a general recommendation.

Edit: I'm also aware that GPUs, especially Nvidia ones, come with widely varying factory overclocks. Unless the benchmarkers even out the clocks between different variants of the same card, it's hard to say anything conclusive. It's worth noting that the Gigabyte 960 used in the video I linked has one of the highest factory overclocks of any version of the 960.[PCPartPicker part list](http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/trFdkL) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/trFdkL/by_merchant/)

* Might as well save OP the trouble of a BIOS update and grab an H97 mobo if it costs that much anyway.
* WD Black is pretty overpriced. The only appreciable difference between this and other 7200RPM HDDs is its longer warranty.
* There are cheaper versions of the 750 Ti, and you can get an R7 370 for cheaper than $130.
* 750W PSU is very overkill for a 243W TDP system. It would be better to get a lower-wattage, higher quality power supply.
I agree with /u/Manodactyl that the recommended specs are pretty vague. Here's one that exceeds all of the listed requirements and should be able to handle any level of multitasking that you do. It's probably overkill, to be honest.

* Xeon E3-1231 V3 is effectively an i7-4770, which is an i5-4670 with hyperthreading enabled. So it has some extra processing power, just in case.
* 16GB of RAM for heavy multitasking (and video rendering, maybe?). Again, just in case.
* R9 380, which is probably very overkill, but it's the best GPU in terms of performance per dollar that I know of. Beyond this point there are some serious diminishing returns. It's unclear what "a faster system is advised" means, but if you do intend to use this for "heavy or advanced use of video" then this will easily have you covered.

EDIT: Added PCI-e FireWire adapter.

Are you near the Micro Center in Detroit / Madison Heights?It's not the VRAM capacity that determines how powerful the card is, but that card is virtually the most powerful card on the market right now. It's pretty overkill for 1080p, so you might as well pick up a 1440p monitor with it as well.Not particularly, aside from the fact that it's black and yellow.Alright, here's my best attempt at an SLI-capable black/yellow spaceship.

Will they all be displaying the same thing, or do they need to be independent?You could get an i7-4790K and overclock it, but that would cost you maybe $150 more, and I'm not sure it would be worth it. And that's not including the Wi-Fi adapter. To be honest there's not much I would do to that build to improve it.

I thought about going with an FX-8320 build, as Fallout 4 recommends eight-thread processors, but it's still very debatable whether that's actually necessary. My gut says a locked i5 is more than enough to comfortably play the game, and games like the Sims will benefit a lot from the single-threaded performance of an Intel processor. On the topic of the Sims, you might want to grab a ~240GB SSD, as that game benefits a lot from faster load times.

No doubt they're tougher than ATX builds. You definitely have to be good about managing cables and careful about which order you install stuff in. 

It might be worth getting a modular power supply like the [HCG-M 620W](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/antec-power-supply-hcg620m) or the [SuperNOVA GS 550W](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/evga-power-supply-220gs0550v1), although who knows what PSU prices will be like when you buy. 

You might also look at picking up a GTX 970 instead of an R9 290/390, if only because it will generate less heat at stock speeds. Performance will be marginally lower, but it'll make the PC less like a space heater. Maybe pay attention to [EVGA B Stock](http://www.evga.com/Products/ProductList.aspx?type=8), as you can get a 970 for $240 if you're quick enough (set up auto-notify). Personally, I'd get the cheapest deal you can find on a good GTX 970, R9 290, or R9 390. I prefer the 390, but great deals are scarce.&gt; I'd like to at least have some of the core components picked out so that I can watch sales over the next few weeks, but I don't plan on building for another month or so.

There's nothing wrong with this, but there's no guarantee that the good sales are going to happen to pop up on the exact components we recommend here. If I were you I would just try to get a general idea of what's good and what isn't, based on the builds and discussion you see in this thread. Then watch /r/buildapcsales for deals and hop on anything that's too good to pass up. And do repost and/or message me when you're about to purchase something, so you can make sure you get the most out of your money.

&gt; Should I look into upgrading that to 1440, knowing that will be a big chunk of my budget? or 2) just stick with it and go for a 1080p oriented build?

If your current monitor works, there's no reason to replace it, unless you particularly want 1440p. Going 1440p will not only add the price of the monitor but add hundreds to the price of the PC itself, since you'll need a much more powerful graphics card (well beyond the point of diminishing returns).

&gt; use my 44" 1080p tv as a monitor? I assume there are challenges driving a larger screen

There are no challenges with driving a larger screen, provided it's also 1080p. The TV has its own power supply, so it won't need any extra juice from your PC. The primary concern with gaming on TV screens is that TVs tend to have much higher latency than computer monitors, which can make certain types of games (FPS, rhythm, anything competitive really) very annoying to play.

---------------------------

All that being said, here's what I would recommend if you were purchasing everything today. It will get you ultra settings in pretty much all current games. Let me know if you have any questions about anything in the build, or just general concerns.

Can anyone confirm if a 980 Ti makes sense for this purpose? I haven't played a lot of Minecraft, but is there any way to play it that would warrant this GPU?That's what I suspected. What GPU do you think would be enough for 1080p? And 1440p? Assuming worst case scenario for graphically intense Minecraft mods.

/u/Arcane_Panda, your wish is my command, so here's what I would consider to be a balanced 1440p gaming build. However, for the purposes you've listed, this seems like a colossal waste of money.

It's unique to Intel CPUs' architecture, as far as I know. This virtual core appears to the PC as just another core. So a hyperthreaded dual-core processor would appear to the computer to have four cores. The virtual cores are actually not as fast as real, physical cores, but they do still add computing power. Each of the cores (physical and virtual) are also called "threads." Hyperthreading in CPUs especially useful in applications that are highly parallelized and use multiple cores at once.

Typically, games don't use many cores, because they are optimized by developers to use only a few. But some games are able to take advantage of higher core counts. Instead, what typically drives gaming performance is how fast the cores are, not how many of them there are. Higher clock speed (or frequency) means higher frame rates, although this comparison doesn't apply between one Intel and one AMD CPU. As far as I knew, Minecraft was a single-threaded application, but apparently either that's changed, or there are mods that are programmed to take advantage of higher core counts.

Typically, differences between Intel CPUs are as follows:

i3: Two cores, four threads

i5: Four cores, four threads

i7: Four cores, eight threads

Thus, i3's and i7's have hyperthreading enabled. The CPU I recommended in my build is a Xeon E3-1231 V3, which is effectively just an i7-4770 without integrated graphics. The lack of integrated graphics doesn't matter because, as a gamer, you're going to have a dedicated GPU anyway, and it's cheaper than an actual i7. Originally the Xeon line was created for servers, not personal computers, but there are some Xeon units that are actually useful for us gamers.I answered this question in response to your other comment.Wow, alright, I won't question it anymore. Some Minecraft mods are pretty insane. For some reason I find it amusing that people will go to such lengths to make a game looks so pretty when it's just a bunch of blocks. Alas, there is a community for literally everything.&gt; all Xeons have it

[Not entirely True](http://ark.intel.com/products/75052/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1220-v3-8M-Cache-3_10-GHz), but for most people's purposes yes that's a good way of looking at it.Are you aware that you picked a 64GB SSD? 120GB ones are around the same price.[PCPartPicker part list](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Y3nHHx) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Y3nHHx/by_merchant/)

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-23 21:52 EDT-0400 |&gt; Go for an i5-4460 if there's a substantial difference in price.

There is a substantial difference in price. The i5-4590 is cheaper. Why would OP want to pay more for a slower processor?

&gt; Opt for 1x8GB of RAM, as dual channel will make no difference for gaming.

If it makes no difference anyway, why would I choose anything but the cheapest RAM? It doesn't get any cheaper than $35. The only reason I would go out of my way to get 1x8GB is because the motherboard only has two RAM slots and I want to leave room to expand. To a gamer, RAM is based on only a few things:

* Does it have enough capacity?
* Are you leaving enough room for expansion?
* If you care (and OP's husband does), does it look cool?
* Does it have a lifetime warranty?

Pick the cheapest RAM that meets all of these requirements, and that's exactly what I did.

&gt; Get a Samsung 850 EVO, as some OCZ SSD's are sub-par and it's not that much more for a more top of the line SSD.

I will never understand why people get so nitpicky about SSD performance. Outside of benchmarks, 99% of consumers will never tell the difference between the 850 EVO and any other SSD out there. To the average consumer, the only speed that matters on an SSD  is "really fast." And every single SSD that exists qualifies as that compared to a mechanical hard drive. SSD read/write speeds only matter in very specific applications, and that doesn't include gaming. You're welcome to pay 40% more for your "top-of-the-line" SSD when it's imperceptibly faster in practice. OP asked for the "cheapest that can run the Witcher 3 on highest settings." In fact, OP never even specified needing an SSD, so being a snob about "sub-par" SSDs doesn't even make sense here.

&gt; Spend more and get a 980 Ti or go for an R9 390.

Again, "cheapest that can run the Witcher 3 on highest settings." The 390, although I love mine to death, isn't enough for an acceptably consistent 60+ FPS in the Witcher 3 on max settings (1080p, Hairworks off). On the other hand, a 980 Ti costs $150 to $200 more than this 980 and is totally overkill for this purpose. I was literally doing exactly what OP said. There are seven cards in consideration here, in order from weakest to strongest:

* GTX 970 ($300)
* R9 390 ($300)
* R9 390X ($400)
* **GTX 980 ($500)**
* R9 Fury ($550)
* R9 Fury X ($650)
* GTX 980 Ti ($650)

The 980 is, literally, the cheapest of those options that does what OP wanted.

&gt; Get a higher quality PSU, such as the EVGA G2/P2 or GS/PS.

OP has no intention of overclocking, so system power consumption will peak in the low 300's. There's no reason a 600B won't be enough to power this system safely. I would've gone for the 500B had this one not been just a few bucks more. Don't get me wrong, the G2/P2 and GS/PS series are fantastic (I own the 650W GS), but there's nothing sketchy about a 600B in this build. And the modularity of the PSU doesn't matter because the case I picked is the S340, in which cable management issues don't exist.Normally I would. It's only $20 more, but I was already over budget before rebates, so I figured I shouldn't push it. OP's playing in 1080p, so it probably wouldn't make a difference at the settings you'd be playing at on a 380 anyway.&gt; I live in the Dallas/Fort Worth Area, Texas, in the USA. I honestly have no idea what a microcenter.

Micro Center is an electronics store. There's one in Dallas. I'd recommend going there for your CPU.

&gt; my power supply I think is good, but idk honestly, its a ToughPower Gold 1000w

Do you have an exact model number for that? I suspect it's fine, especially since it's grossly overpowered for this system, but I'd like to make sure I'm reading the right reviews.

&gt; My current comp is blue so anything else haha, maybe like a green and white look.

Green and white is one of the hardest combinations I can think of. Even green and black might be a little rough. I'll just give you a quality "bland" tower, then give you a build where I've done my best to color-coordinate the components (not blue).

&gt; maybe an SD card slot if that's a thing

That's absolutely a thing. The easiest thing would be to get a card reader that fits in the optical drive bays.

&gt; I prefer 7, if that's still possible to get

Yeah, definitely not a problem.

-------------------------------------

This should work great for both editing and gaming, and it doesn't really approach your maximum budget at all. Do you want to spend closer to your budget, or is this okay with you? I suppose the next logical thing to do from here would be to upgrade to a six-core processor, but I'm not sure if that would be worth the money in your opinion.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-24 02:11 EDT-0400 |&gt; I wasn't aware the 4590 was cheaper.

Micro Center is magical.

&gt; Without going in to ultra territory, the 970 holds up very well

I was operating under the assumption that OP did want to go into ultra territory here, although according to /u/transam617 I wasn't being conservative enough. I was avoiding AMD here because of the Witcher 3's better performance with Nvidia cards (and the fact that Hairworks only works with them). 

I guess I just made the mistake of assuming the 980 was substantially more powerful than the 970. I had heard that the 970, when aggressively overclocked, was about equal to a 980. A maxed out 970 can handle ultra settings, can it not? I guess not.

This is probably the only time I've ever recommended a 980, as  I was aware it's typically not an attractive buy over a 390 or a Fury. If a 980 doesn't even make sense in this context, then I guess I'll never recommend one again.

&gt; I seem to doubt that, especially with a 980. Here seems to suggest 520W for the GPU alone, then about 100-150W left for the CPU and other components to operate safely.

That page seems to be making recommendations for total PSU wattage, based on typical loads for the entire system, not just the graphics card. I don't think you need to add 100-150W to those figures. [Here](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-980/specifications) are the official specifications for the GTX 980. TDP is 165W without raising the power limit, and recommended system power is 500W. No single GPU uses anywhere close to 500W of power. Even the Fury X has a maximum power draw of 275W.

&gt; Sure, the average user won't notice a huge difference but I go with them (if there's budget) because of quality.

I understand that this is somewhat a matter of preference, as is the matter of PSUs. If I were buying a PC now, I would get the cheapest SSD that doesn't have a reputation for failure. I personally would rather either keep that money and put it in my pocket or spend it on something more important than a marginally better SSD. 

And I feel like a bit of a hypocrite here, because the PC I'm using right now has an R9 390, an 850 EVO, and a 650W GS in it. But I've realized since I built this PC that I overspent quite a bit on it. When OP asks for the cheapest solution, I want to respect that request by giving the most cost-effective suggestion that I have confidence in.How exactly does the 980 perform with ultra settings at 1080p? Does it just sometimes dip below 60 FPS? If that's all then I'm still not convinced a 980 Ti would be worth the extra $170.

Edit: Oh man, Hairworks really [shits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUTsy3OeiwQ) on your FPS. Maybe I should rephrase the question. /u/Viverra, is your husband being able to see realistic hair physics worth $170 to you?Man, that's brutal. Alright, you win! /u/Viverra, if this doesn't do it, I don't know what will.*

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-24 05:17 EDT-0400 |&gt; I have a sound card with my current build, but I've heard motherboards these days have equally comparable sound, so I guess that's not necessary.

No, it's not necessary to have a sound card except for very specific purposes.

&gt; Other than that, I don't really care for having more than one card, I don't play more than one game at once.

Multi-GPU setups aren't for playing multiple games at once. They're for combining graphics cards' resources to play a single game better.

&gt; I would like a beefy single card that'll be a considerable powerhouse (hopefully) till 2020 than can continue to run everything maxed throughout the years. (might be wishful thinking here though).

Definitely wishful thinking here. Even at 1680x1050, I couldn't guarantee you any single card would be a "monster" in 2017, let alone 2020. It wouldn't be too hard to give you a build that will stay mostly relevant for the next few years, but you'll definitely want to upgrade your GPU a few times.I'm not the guy who recommended you the build but I have some responses.

&gt; Under 450w so I can reuse PS.

&gt; Thinking crossfire over sli I want to be able to build it more later on

What power supply do you have specifically? If it's a low-quality unit you may want to replace it anyway. Also, it probably doesn't have enough connectors for SLI/CF anyway. Not to mention you would need a motherboard capable of SLI if you wanted to use two GTX 960s.

&gt; Also probably going to go with one 8GB stick to save space for expansion.

The motherboard has four slots anyway, so unless you need 32GB (and you won't), 2x4GB is fine.

&gt; I was looking at an r9 380 but I like the clock on that.

Normally I would recommend a 380 but if you insist on reusing the 450W PSU, a 960 might be a safer bet, because who knows how safe that PSU is. Again I ask, what power supply do you have? If it turns out you should replace the PSU anyway, you might as well get a 380.

-----------------------

Here's how I personally would change that build:

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-24 06:15 EDT-0400 |&gt; I think that given the budget is so low, leaning towards an AMD centric build could help him get more bang for his buck. I would go with a FX-6300 for the $100 6 core (providing a slightly better single core performance as well)

The reason I went with the i3 over an FX-6300 was specifically for higher single-thread performance. Whenever you're not on mobile, link me to some evidence that a non-overclocked FX-6300 has better single-core performance than an i3. I'd be happy to admit I'm wrong, but I've never heard anyone claim this before. I am a fan of the FX-6300, but I think OP should overclock it to make it worth it. 

&gt; and shoot for a R9 270X or possibly a 280

The 950 beats the 270X in most games, I'm pretty sure, and the 280/285/380 would probably be tough to squeeze in. We're already close to the budget here.

&gt; while maybe finding a more suitable storage option (possibly a Kingston SSDNow series 120GB SSD or the OCZ 120 GB SSD) coupled with the 1 TB drive.

Now that's definitely not going to fit in the budget. And I just realized I missed an optical drive and a Wi-Fi card. This is gonna be rough. This build here is pretty much at OP's limit, before rebates, if you factor in shipping from SuperBiiz and OutletPC.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-24 11:50 BST+0100 |Clock speed matters a lot more than memory does. In fact it's debatable whether the 4GB version is worth the extra $20 (the 2GB PCS+ 380 is $164 after rebate/shipping). But if you're comparing the clock speed of the 960 to that of the 380, that doesn't make sense. Comparing clocks only works between two of the same card. I'm pretty sure a 380 at 980MHz will outperform a 960 at 1280HMz. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0HzWW6mDno) is a recent and relevant DigitalFoundry video. I know it's a bit dubious to use a single YouTube video as evidence, but it'll help me illustrate my point, and you're welcome to investigate it further. The 4GB 960 in the video is clocked at 1220MHz at stock and overclocked to 1450MHz. You can see that in most games the stock 380 is on par with the overclocked 960. 

As for the difference between the 2GB and 4GB versions, you can see that there basically isn't one. It might make a difference at a higher resolution, but these cards are meant for 1080p anyway. In 1080p, 4GB might be useful for, say, high-resolution textures, but a card like the 380 would struggle with those anyway. Some people like to argue for the 4GB versions of the 960/380 as a matter of "future-proofing" since it only costs a little bit more. Personally, I would probably just get the 2GB version. I'll leave it up to you to decide if the VRAM is worth the extra cash. Either way, I think most people in this sub will agree that the 380 is a better buy than the 960 in general.

Edit: The 4GB version of the 380 probably makes more sense in a Crossfire setup, where only one of the cards' VRAM is usable. I personally don't think Crossfire is the best upgrade path, but that is definitely a context in which the 4GB versions have an advantage.Absolutely.

-------------------------

Edit: Here's one with an 8GB stick of RAM (will be necessary for more demanding games) and a 500W PSU. This is more easily upgraded later. You can swap the Pentium for an i5 or Xeon and the GPU for, well, whatever the best mid-range GPU is at the time of upgrade. You could also add another 8GB stick of RAM and an SSD if you see fit. 

Edit 2: It's also worth noting that overclocking the G3258 is easy on the stock cooler (4.0GHz, even) and highly recommended. 25% extra CPU performance for no additional investment.

Yeah, I was just trying to keep the black and blue thing going. Sounds good. Here's a build with a hexa-core processor and 32GB of RAM, which should be a substantial improvement in rendering times over the previous builds. Unfortunately this means you shouldn't use Windows 7, since it only supports up to 16GB of RAM. [Here](http://www.microcenter.com/site/brands/intel-processor-bundles.aspx) is the relevant Micro Center CPU/mobo bundle.

Edit: It's also worth noting that with this build CrossFire should be easy. If you ever need more power, you can grab another 390 and put it in without having to worry about compatibility issues with motherboard/power supply. If you want more graphics power right now, though, I'd recommend just getting a stronger single card.

* Cheaper RAM.
* 2.5" version of that SSD is a bit cheaper.

If 8GB, might as well just reuse that.Fantastic build. I wasn't even aware that any LGA 1150 mobo had USB 3.1. A couple of nitpicky questions:

* Since OP doesn't plan to overclock, wouldn't it make sense to get a version of the 980 Ti with a higher core clock, like the EVGA FTW one? $50 more, between the two cards, and almost 10% more performance.
* The 1050W GS is virtually the same price as the 850W G2 right now. They're both top-of-the-line PSUs, and I'm aware 850W is enough for two non-overclocked 980 Ti's, but why not go 1050W if it's the same price?
* What exactly is the advantage of that monitor over a $400 4K IPS monitor or the $700 4K G-Sync one? I know it's what OP chose, I'm just curious what makes it worth the extra price tag.

&gt; The Pentium won't bottleneck your 770, it should be fine.

This is an oversimplification of bottlenecking. There is no magical relationship between CPU and GPU such that you can make a blanket statement like this. Bottlenecking depends on the resources allocated by the application. There is no CPU that simply does, or doesn't, "bottleneck your 770." There are some games in which even a 4790K will bottleneck a 770, and there are some contexts in which a G3258 won't even bottleneck a 980 Ti. It doesn't make sense to say that a CPU "won't bottleneck" a GPU without talking about a specific game or subset of games.There's a lot of misinformation in this thread. Here's my suggestion:

* Great dual-core processor if you don't intend to overclock.
* Inexpensive motherboard that has all the features you need.
* Inexpensive case with room for an optical drive and two pre-installed fans.
* Excellent deal on a decent 550W PSU, but you're not buying before the sale ends anyway. If you can spare the $50 upfront, I'd recommend picking this up right away.
* 1080p IPS monitor at a good price.

It's just that it doesn't matter 99% of the time.System power consumption will peak under 400W in a non-overclocked 860K/770 setup. It might break 400W under an extreme stress test, but never under normal use. 500 watts is plenty.PSA to others trying to make AUD builds: Be careful with CPL. Look at each product page before you put the part in your build and make sure it's not "end of life." This was particularly a pain in the ass for PSUs and monitors in my build.

-------------------------

&gt; Due to the clearance of my desk, the largest ATX case I can have is a Corsair 540 Smaller cases are alright though.

This made it a bit difficult. The Air 540 is short for an ATX case since the PSU doesn't need to be mounted below the motherboard. I went with ~~a similar case here, but with Micro ATX~~ that exact case.

&gt; The main thing I'd like it to have a machine that lasts for a good long while before needing any major upgrades (replacing parts, not adding)

I went with a 980 Ti, since it's the best card on the market right now and nothing will last you longer. I think it's terribly overkill for a 1080p build but if you insist on not upgrading your GPU then you might as well get the best of the best. Normally I would recommend a more cost-effective option like an AMD R9 390, followed by an upgrade one or two years down the line.

Upgrade the graphics card if you must, and get more SSD space if you would prefer. Upgrading to a GTX 970 or R9 390 would give you a decent boost in gaming performance but I'm not sure it's enough of a difference to be worth the price. You could go for an R9 Fury, but that's a little outside your budget and probably a bit overkill anyway.

If you have a full (not OEM) version of Windows, you might try grabbing a Z87/Z97 motherboard so you can overclock your CPU, since you for some reason didn't do that when you originally built your PC. If your OS is OEM, then you would have to buy a new OS to swap the motherboard, and that sounds a lot less worth it. But overclocking your CPU in general isn't that important and won't do as much for you as a new graphics card.This should accomplish what you asked for and look stylish while doing it. Do you *want* to spend $1600?

Brand loyalty doesn't make much sense here. You can ignore our suggestions and get a 970 instead, but since I'm trying to make sure you get the most out of your money I can't in good conscience tell you to get a 970.If you notice that you're getting USB 2.0 speeds in your USB 3.0 front ports, then you just plug into the back ports. Unless you have a multitude of external drives for which transfer speed is critical, it's still not a problem worth investing extra money for.&gt; A weaker CPU will bottleneck, a stronger one will not. It's a simple concept.

My point is that there's no relationship between the CPU and the GPU that would justify saying that the G3258 simply won't bottleneck a 770. It's not a simple concept because every game uses the hardware differently.

&gt; I'd like to know which games those are &amp; at what resolution they're being played.

* Planetside 2 is a game known for being heavily CPU-intensive. In especially large battles, there is no CPU  that won't get shit on by this game, despite it not taking much to max out the graphics.
* Minecraft is known to be a terribly optimized game that does way too much CPU work. Without intense shaders, even a $90 graphics card will max out the settings, but the CPU will really feel it.
* Civilization V, especially later in the game when the whole map has been filled up, takes a toll on your CPU, whereas a 770 will have no trouble with any part of this game.
* Almost all MMOs have serious difficulty in large battles and in towns where there are lots of things moving around.
* Many games that need to simulate many different things at once, such as city builders and open-world RPGs, will hit a bottleneck on a 4790K long before a 770 breaks a sweat. 

I'm aware that some of these examples would also be problems with a G3258, since most of those games aren't highly threaded. But there are many situations where it would be straight up incorrect to say that a G3258 won't be the bottleneck. For example, In GTA V, the 770 should allow you to get decently high settings with a smooth frame rate. But there are no settings available that would allow you to get more than 30-40 FPS on a G3258, and it's worse without overclocking.

It just annoys me when people say "X won't bottleneck Y" without first assuming any context. It's an oversimplification of PC components and the way they interact. Sometimes all you need is a G3258 and a 960, and sometimes all you need is an i5 and a 750 Ti. When we get new builders on here, they take your word for it when you say things like this. And then they go play an MMO and wonder why they get crappy performance in some games when their CPU was supposed to "not bottleneck" their GPU.&gt; How much of a frame rate difference would that 10% add to justify the extra $50?

Theoretically 10% higher frequency is 10% more FPS. Normally with a 980 Ti the assumption is that the user is overclocking it anyway, but if OP really doesn't want to for some reason then he might as well spend $50 more on his $3000 build on graphics cards that are factory overclocked higher.Yes, absolutely. Although, I suspect no major upgrades will be necessary for a few years. You might need to get some more RAM within the next year or so, and a year or two after that it'll probably be a new graphics card if a new game comes along that he wants to max out. There's nothing about the case that wouldn't accept future upgrades.Why do you want water cooling so badly if you don't know if you want to overclock?

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-26 08:54 AEDT+1100 |&gt; I am totally okay with spending 1600$ to 2000$.

I know you're okay with spending $1600 to $2000. I guess what I'm asking is, if the above build is more than enough for this:

&gt; I'd like to play most game on ultra 1080p and editing on vegas and after effects

Do you still want to invest more money into it, despite the diminishing returns on that investment? It's not hard to add more power to the build but it may be overkill for your purposes. So do you want the best $2000 build we can give you, or do you want a more cost-effective option? 

No doubt, going overkill now will allow you to go longer without an upgrade, but upgrading a fairly high-end GPU every two years is more efficient than buying a top-of-the-line card every three years. On the other hand, if you want ultra settings at 1440p instead of 1080p, you'll need something more powerful than an R9 390.

&gt; By the way, I like to play heavy games like gta V and other demanding storage game. Should I replace the SSD with 2TB hard drive or what is your recommendation?

I guess that depends how many games you play. You could just add a 1TB HDD and leave the SSD in there.With this build, as long as the case is an "ATX" case and not a "Micro ATX" or "Mini ITX" Case, it should be fine. [Here](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/case/#t=1,4,3,13) is a list of cases filtered such that only ATX cases are shown.No problem! The power supply might seem like overkill but I figured I should leave you the option to SLI.A 270X for $60? My cousin paid more than twice that much for his. Sounds like a solid deal!I don't doubt that the build is good. I think very highly of the G3258 and would have no problem pairing it with any card in the right context. I just know from my experience learning about PCs that it's easy to be misinformed about these things. Since we're trying to do people a service, and also because there are other helpful people learning from us, we shouldn't oversimplify an issue and make people think that choosing a CPU boils down to something as black-and-white as "once you get to X GPU, you should move up to Y CPU." I used to think that way because of people either being to lazy to explain the difference or just being misinformed themselves.No, I doubt this will max those games out. Do you want the cheapest build that will, or the best $1500 PCs I can come up with?Alright, I'll give you two options, and you can either pick one or go somewhere in between.

---------------------

Here is the least expensive build that *I think* (no way to know just yet) will be able to max out Fallout 4 at 1080p. Beyond this point, we start to hit some pretty rough diminishing returns on investment.

----------------------

Here is the best I can do with $1500. A 980 Ti will likely play the game handily at 1440p, so I went with a higher-resolution monitor. I also added an SSD for a boot drive and went with a slightly higher-quality PSU just to be safe.

This doesn't mean you don't need Windows. If what you have installed right now is an OEM (not full) version of Windows (and I suspect it is), then it's linked to your current motherboard, and you'll need a new copy of the OS for this new motherboard.

Given that you can reuse your RAM and HDD, it looks like you can get more than average performance. How about ultra settings?

A Pentium and 750 Ti will run very cool in the case. No need to worry about that. Just try to clean dust out of your case periodically, and buy some dust filters for the case intake fans if the case doesn't come with them. The case I chose comes with two fans pre-installed.

&gt; (2) is there no reason to worry about the quality of the $20 PSUs?

The CX-430 is a solid budget PSU, and it's more than enough to power a build that uses as little power as this.

&gt; (3) just realized that given that I'll be building closer to Thanksgiving, maybe I should wait until black Friday deals are posted. Would there be a good time to post a request here to get a build that takes advantage of some of the deals we'll see soon??

These deals are already pretty good. I wouldn't expect much better than this because of Black Friday, but you should be able to get deals similar to these any time of year. Feel free to send me a PM before you buy so I can make sure you're updated on current sales and stuff.Yes and yes.Just add another 980 Ti. The motherboard supports SLI, and the power supply has more than enough juice for two graphics cards.What does your current build consist of? I see no point in spending hundreds of dollars replacing it for a marginal improvement.The Witcher 3 does actually run better on an i7 than an i5, assuming your GPU is strong enough to force a CPU bottleneck. That game, and GTA V, would run on an i3, just not as well as an i5. I would still try to go for an i5.$175 for a GTX 770 is a pretty average deal, considering its performance is about equal to that of a GTX 960, except that it's less power-efficient. It's definitely possible to fit an i5 in on this budget if you select less expensive parts and drop the aftermarket cooler.I see no reason why you can't have an i5 and still get everything you want.

The Fury costs $250 more and will allow you to do the same in many of those games at 1440p. But of course, you would need a 1440p monitor. I'd say a Fury is pretty overkill for 1080p, currently. But who knows, maybe a year from now it won't be. The question is whether to invest now or upgrade later. 

You may need to remove drive bays to make one if these GPUs fit, which means you would need a 5.25"-to-3.25" adapter to mount your HDD in one of the optical drive bays. Alright, I think I've managed to meet all of your preferences here.

* i5-4590 for $160 because Micro Center is magical (in-store only).
* 16GB of RAM and a B85 motherboard so there's room to upgrade if you ever need it. 16GB of memory seems like overkill to me, but your wish is my command.
* 120GB SSD for the OS and 1TB HDD for storage. For $30 more you can get a 240GB SSD and be able to play games like Fallout 4 with faster loading times, and you could pay for it by downgrading to 8GB of RAM.
* R9 380 for ultra settings in many games and relatively high settings in the rest. Certainly not as powerful as the R9 390 that /u/Du6e recommended, but given your other preferences this may be the best option.
* The white S340, my favorite case. Easy to build in, wide open for good airflow, very aesthetically pleasing, and at an affordable price from Micro Center.
* Quality SeaSonic PSU that will handle any single GPU you throw at it. Not on the same level of quality as the SuperNOVA GS series (as /u/Du6e recommended), but very reliable, more than enough for this system, and $25 cheaper before rebate, with free shipping.

Comes out to about $720 with shipping (from OutletPC) before the rebate, $700 after it. Is this too much for you?

They're nowhere near the quality you'd expect from the GS (SeaSonic) or G2 (Super Flower) lines. [Here](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story6&amp;reid=442) is a review of the NEX650G. SeaSonic's S12II series, while still not quite up to the level of the GS and G2, is definitely more reliable than the G1 line. [Here](http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story5&amp;reid=185) is a review for the S12II's 520W version. 

This isn't to say that an NEX650G is completely unsuitable for this build. The build, even if it included a 390, wouldn't use much more than 400W under peak load. But considering that it's $15 more expensive before rebate and only $10 less after rebate, I'd say that the drop in quality isn't worth the price tag. If I really needed to save money in the PSU department, I'd pick the EVGA 600B (by HEC), which is only $39.99 after rebate from Newegg. Here's one with an i5 and 16GB of RAM. Are you near [this Micro Center](http://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/fairfax.aspx)? I might be able to put together something a bit better than this without going over budget.

This game can really demand a lot from your CPU. I considered going with an FX-8320 but picked a 4690K just to be sure.

&gt; Monitor (Unless the GPU has VGA output).

This is not something that should cause you to need a new monitor. Maybe an HDMI adapter or something, but certainly not a whole monitor.

&gt; If you have recommendations for MIDI peripherals, that would be cool too.

I don't know anything about these, unfortunately, but this should cover the internal hardware. Maybe this build can be used as a starting point for others to improve on.

It shouldn't cost more than half your budget to play these games. Do you want a build that can play everything at ultra, just games like these, or somewhere in between?&gt; and change the cpu base clock to 3,6

You can often go up to 4.0GHz on the stock cooler. Not sure how necessary that is for this build, but it is possible. Solid build. Don't think it can be improved at all, and it beats the crap out of that pre-built.A 980 Ti is the best chance you've got at getting 144 FPS in very demanding games on a single card. It depends on the game, but you may hit a CPU bottleneck that prevents you from getting to 144 Hz in some of them. The best solution to this would be overclocking a 4690K, but since you're heavily opposed to that the only way to get appreciably higher clock speed is by getting a 4790K, which is clocked at 4.0GHz by default (25% more FPS in highly CPU-bottlenecked scenarios). This would put you slightly over budget before rebates, so I'll let you decide if that's worth it.

In fact, I'm not even sure that 16GB will. An SSD is easier to deal with when you install your OS on it at first instead of migrating it from an HDD later. And even dropping some RAM and the SSD isn't going to get you all the way to a 970/390. As you can see in /u/Du6e's build, you would need to also downgrade the CPU, and those aren't cheap to replace either.

He can either get a 380 and upgrade it a year from now or get a 390 and upgrade it a year and a half from now. At least when he upgrades from the 380 he didn't spend $300 on it. OP is going to need to upgrade stuff anyway, so we might as well give a balanced build that meets the requirements *explicitly stated* in the post. How many of OP's preferences for this build do we need to dismiss to make it fit our own?Ah, so Micro Center is an hour and a half way. Not worth it. I was gonna try to fit in a [Xeon E3-1231 V3](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80646e31231v3). Without Micro Center's in-store deal ($210) it would go over budget since you would also need to get a cheap graphics card (~$30) to drive your monitor(s).

OutletPC is a solid dealer. If you buy multiple parts from them, it all gets lumped into one shipping cost (~$8), which is convenient.

EDIT: You know what, let me just give you the option. I downgraded to 8GB of RAM but left the motherboard alone because it has room for up to 32GB. If you're sure you won't need more than 16GB ever, then I can save another $15 in that department. RAM is easy to upgrade later. We're now $25 over budget before rebates, but the hyperthreaded Xeon is a beast that will last you a really long time no matter what you're doing with it. Just make sure you're plugging your displays into the graphics card and not the motherboard, since the Xeon doesn't have integrated graphics.

This motherboard won't do it if you do.I too am in favor of supporting AMD, but not to the point where I'd recommend something that, at least from what I've seen, is equal to *or worse than* a 980 Ti. Do you have evidence that it can be better?Good, because you would also have needed a larger PSU.I don't see anything wrong with the quality of the parts, but I suppose you have pretty high standards for PSUs. I can't speak for the reliability of the USB WiFi adapter, as I've never owned one. His build seems fine to me.&gt; OP definitely won't have to upgrade a 390 in a year in a half lol.

I was only using that time frame as an example. Sorry, I should've made that clearer. When each card would need to be upgraded depends on what settings OP is okay with, and when that one game comes along that pushes the 380/390 to its limit at those settings. If OP wants ultra settings in 99% of games, the 390 may not even be there a year from now. If OP wants at least high settings in all games, then the 380 will do it for a while, and the 390 a while longer. It's a matter of economics. How much will either option cost in the long run?

My build:

* Has everything OP wants, but GPU will need to be replaced before the 390 would.
* At some point, OP can sell the 380 (for maybe $120?) and get a new card.

/u/transam617's build:

* Has a 390, which currently gets ultra settings in pretty much everything.
* At some point further down the line, OP can sell the 390 (for, say, $200?) and get a new card.
* OP still needs to buy an SSD and more RAM, and didn't get his windowed white case.

So build #1 has OP at a loss of $60 but needs a GPU upgrade sooner. Build #2 has OP at a loss of $100 for the card and maybe $60 for the SSD and RAM given ever-decreasing prices on those.Would you like a solid-state drive? A 120GB one costs about $40 and will make your computer boot a lot faster, and a 240GB one is about $70 and will also let some of your games get through loading screens a lot faster. Does this sound important to you or would you prefer to invest that money in more gaming power? The 380 can be had for slightly less than that 270X, and the PSU is pretty mediocre. Aside from that that I wouldn't change a thing.No problem. Send me a message before you purchase so I can update the list with current deals.I might be able to find one, but even if I did it might cost you more than just buying an adapter. Are there any downsides to that conversion that I'm unaware of? I wouldn't recommend a GTX 960 over an R9 285 or R9 380, but it would be the closest thing price-wise. You'd have to overclock the 960 a bit to match them performance-wise. Any reason in particular for wanting an Nvidia card? Still only one HDMI on this one, but DVI-to-HDMI connectors are less than $10, so that's not a problem really.

So you don't need monitor/keyboard/mouse?

&gt; Yes. 8.1 or 10, it doesn't matter.

Why do you need a new OS if you're reusing the motherboard?There used to be a time when Nvidia made more sense than ATI. People who persist today telling everyone that Nvidia is simply "better" than AMD are uninformed and should take care not to misinform others. AMD competes well against Nvidia at most price points, but people continue to stick to Nvidia because it's what they're comfortable with. As consumers, we ought to pick what will give use the best performance per dollar. In this case, given current Canadian prices, the GTX 960 is cheaper than the R9 380, so I have no problem recommending it. But at equal prices, I would absolutely pick the 380.Yeah I noticed that as well. Between the 960, 285, and 380, if one is significantly cheaper (as the 960 currently is) then buy that one. But things may be different when you actually purchase your parts. I would say to wait until a month or so before you buy and if any of these three drops to a price you can't pass up, snag it.[PCPartPicker part list](http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/hNgFVn) / [Price breakdown by merchant](http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/hNgFVn/by_merchant/)

That depends on whether you had a full or OEM version of Windows. OEM versions are forever linked to the motherboard they're installed on. Based on what you just said, it sounds like you have a full version of Windows, which is readily transferable to a new motherboard.

Nonetheless, here's my recommendation.

Edit: Let me clarify a bit. An Intel quad-core, such as a Core i5-4460, would be objectively better in most cases and equal in some. An AMD quad-core, like the FX-4300 or the Athlon X4 860K, would be better in some cases and worse in others.I can't guarantee this is going to get high settings in Fallout 4, and it is over budget before rebates, but I think it's the best I can do.

http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story&amp;reid=214Allow me to make a suggestion that foregoes some of what you've asked for.

* I know you've expressed some interest in overclocking, but investing in an overclockable CPU, aftermarket cooler, and compatible motherboard is not the most cost-effective option, as a locked i5 is enough to play any game comfortably. I went with the Xeon, which is an i7-4770 without integrated graphics. The hyperthreading will help with productivity, some current games, and presumably future DX12 games. It's also cheaper than an i7, and the lack of an iGPU doesn't matter if you have a dedicated card.
* No aftermarket cooler, which saves you money and is unnecessary with a locked CPU.
* A B85 motherboard with enough slots for 32GB of RAM. It has all the features you need, so why spend more money?
* 16GB of RAM, which helps with multitasking and productivity and potentially future-proofs you a bit for gaming. We've already seen that Battlefront can use more than 8GB of RAM, so it's not crazy to think that this could continue to happen with future titles.
* 120GB SSD for a boot drive and a standard 1TB HDD.
* With all the money saved on the other components, you're able to fit in arguably the best card on the market, the GTX 980 Ti. It's overkill for 1080p, but it will keep you gaming at 1080p for longer than any card out there right now.
* This case for some reason comes with five fans and only costs $69 AUD. You wanted airflow, so here you go.
* Quality semi-modular 620W power supply that will handle any single card you throw at it. And here's where I've again gone against your request. SLI/CF is not, in my opinion, the most cost-effective upgrade path, unless you're looking for the absolute best PC out there, which right now means multiple 980 Ti's. I especially wouldn't recommend SLI/CF if you were using anything less than a 980 Ti or Fury X. It requires a more expensive motherboard and power supply. In my opinion, it would be better to run with a single card for a few years and replace it with whatever the best single card is at that point in the future.
* I didn't include a WiFi card because I don't know enough about them to make a recommendation. As far as I know it can depend on your connection type, so I figured it would be best to let you figure that part out.

 | Generated by [PCPartPicker](http://pcpartpicker.com) 2015-10-29 02:41 AEDT+1100 |The motherboard is a basic B85 motherboard. The expensive motherboards you're probably referring to are Z97 motherboards, which come with CPU overclocking capabilities and are usually SLI-ready. As I've said, CPU overclocking has minimal benefits when gaming and costs significantly more money. 

Granted, I think some of the others have chosen more expensive components than they needed to, even for an overclocking setup. Liquid cooling, for example, is pretty inefficient cost-wise for what it provides, and a decent Z97 motherboard shouldn't cost you more than maybe $150. If you're interested to see how much more an overclocking setup would cost you, I can modify the build. 

What have you owned in the past that you've had such terrible experiences with? I don't foresee any temperature issues with a Xeon and the stock Intel cooler. There's nothing wrong with the PSU. People need to stop shitting on the CX series every chance they get.

http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&amp;op=Story&amp;reid=214

Fair point on the CPU.&gt; I hardly ever suggest an i3 for gaming. They are awesome, but not for games.

This is a highly misinformed statement. Most games do not make use of even four CPU cores, and many of the ones that do have no trouble running the game on two. There are some notable exceptions, such as GTA V and The Witcher 3, but for the most part clock speed remains more important than core count. This trend is starting to change, but there's no reason an i3 can't handle 97% of games, especially the ones OP listed. I have lots of love for the FX-8320, just not in this context.Here's a &lt;$500 build that, honestly, is pretty overkill for the "low-demand gaming" you've specified in your post. There's plenty of room for expansion later, as the CPU can be upgraded to something like an i5 later on, and the power supply has enough juice for a more powerful graphics card if needed.

It's a maximum of $10 per purchase, not per item.Guys, we need to be more careful with SuperBiiz's promo. The $10 maximum applies per purchase, not per item. Also, we should make more of an effort to be conscious of unlisted shipping prices from SuperBiiz, NCIX US, etc.

Here's something that will have equal performance to the other builds posted in the thread at a lower cost. I don't think it's worth pushing it closer to $500, since there's no need for a better CPU, and the next GPU tier is a bit out of reach.

* i5-4590 for $160 from Micro Center, in-store only. If you don't want to drive there, you could just pick up the i5-4460 online for $10 to $15 more.
* B85 motherboard. I could've gone for a slightly cheaper H81, but I assume from your post that you have 2x4GB RAM, which means that if you want room to expand  you'll need more than two RAM slots. Note that the cost of the motherboard is more like $58, since OutletPC has an unlisted shipping cost that applies once per purchase.
* R9 380. At $160 after rebate, there's no better choice if you're buying new.
* ATX mid tower, as requested, with two pre-installed fans.
* Solid budget PSU with a great price after rebate.

I've also tried to avoid high unlisted shipping costs.

* You aren't planning on overclocking, and Skylake doesn't provide much over Haswell, so I didn't sink a bunch of money (read: about $200 more) into an overclockable Skylake setup.
* There are few contexts in which the differences in speed between various SSDs matter. Gaming isn't one of them, so I picked a cheaper SSD. Not to mention you never asked for an SSD anyway.
* All around, I picked equal-performing, less expensive parts, so the total is $300 less without a noticeable impact on performance.

An i7 rarely has any advantages over an i5 in gaming, but the hyperthreading may benefit your video editing work. I'd be happy to recommend a hyperthreading-enabled CPU if you think your "light" video editing is worth some extra investment. However, the "K" version of that processor means it is overclockable, and since you don't intend to overclock, it makes little sense to get a 4790K. What i'm going to recommend is a Xeon E3-1231 V3, which is effectively an i7-4770, but significantly cheaper and without integrated graphics. The lack of an iGPU doesn't matter because as a gamer you'll be using a dedicated graphics card anyway. I also threw in an extra 8GB of RAM to help with editing and multitasking.

This one will hopefully get you high settings, although probably not ultra, and it contains a small SSD for the OS.

---------------------------------------------

This one is over more likely to get you ultra settings, but it contains no SSD and its significantly over budget before mail-in rebates. It's still unclear whether this CPU will bottleneck performance, as no real benchmarks have shown up yet.

* Not deceptively cheap because of SuperBiiz's promo, which only applies once to the entire purchase, not per item.
* No USB 3.0 front ports, but if you really need the transfer speed for external drives, you can use the back ports.

Definitely better performance per dollar, but since we don't know what case OP is using, and considering there isn't much room for a decent aftermarket CPU cooler, it's hard to have 100% confidence in that recommendation.I'd recommend, unless /u/lilwhitestormy absolutely needs to play the game on launch day, that he/she wait until after some CPU benchmarks show up to make a better decision. If it turns out that an i3 is more than enough for smooth gameplay, that would be a decent option.I agree that you don't want to get an unreliable power supply, but not every build needs a top-tier PSU. There are plenty of reliable, less expensive offerings out there. I own the 650W GS, and I wish I had spent some of that money on other components.&gt; Would love to be able to play new releases at ultra/very high for the next couple years at least.

This is where the 390 becomes necessary, in my opinion. If I may make a recommendation for a cheaper alternative to this build, here's one that should perform the same in every perceptible way without picking unreliable parts. Without the monitor, we're under $700 after rebates.

&gt; light gaming

What does this mean? It's hard to make a GPU recommendation without knowing what games you're interested in playing.

&gt; Printer?

Do you need to print in color?
