It's so worth it though...Cause a LOT of people like the way the clock works like real time.&gt;  The story as a whole starts out with the player's intentions to attend university, in which plays a vital role in your storyline. There are no badges, there are no E4. The whole game is intended to have more of an RPG feel and hopes to give Pok\u00e9mon games a new twist outside of the conventional "become champion" motif.

Already beating out gamefreakIt's like saying : "I don't mean to be rude, but [super rude thing to say]"Glorious5Octo-ber doesn't make sense for a JAPANESE gameIf eh was smart, he would make black slime become regular slime again, since slime typing is based on intake.Someone who has never held a real gun before and is holding a fake gun would have no understanding of trigger discipline (nor need it)Zelda sequilitis was very flawed, and he admitted it himself.  
No one is saying all his sequilitis' are, just that one.  
And even then, pointing out flaws in his creative work is exactly what Arin has always asked for himself.  
A creator does not improve from praise, they do so from straight forward, critical analysis of their work.

And He shrugs of Dan cause for one, he isn't someone to go : "yeah, I'm just THAT great" unless he is being sarcastic about it.  
and two : if we are being honest, it's not like dan is a leading authority on game design, especially so more modern game design.  

Or he just powersaved it...Anubis didn't need a wielder to "activate" though, he was still consious when not being wielded by anyone.  
The fact he could take over silver chariot is irrelevant to the fact he is a stand that survived his user's death.  

You also assume there is such a thing as an absolute rule amongst stands.  
spoiler : there isn't.  

Every single one of the "stand rules" have been broken.  

We have had stands that act against their users, even killing them.  
We have had stands that survive their users' death  
We have had stands that do not cause "recoil" damage to their user.  
We have had stands that were insanely strong despite distance  
We have had stands that are visible to non-stand users  
Etc...   

The entire point of stands is that they are unknown.  
The 'rules' that are stated are merely something 99% of stands have in common, and thus the in-world characters assume them to be a guarentee, while that is not so.The real problem is that people think stands ever trully abide by "laws" (also : That Araki follows his own rules when he doesn't feel like it)   

None of the "stand rules" have not been broken by now.Dunno, they seem pretty breakable when I throw them off the platforms.I actually really hoped Holly was gonna be able to keep and control her stand.  &gt; 2) I honestly don't know how to respond to a person who suggests Federation Force as an alternative to Super Metroid.

reread the thread ya shriekbat[\u201dWell, it may be stupid, but it\u2019s also dumb.\u201d](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Trubbish_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29)Cause leaving hyrule would take to long probably.I doubt the flood was done by the goddessesm so who knows.  
I wouldn't be surprised if only Hyrule was affected though.I couldn't tell you.  
I love all zelda games immensly, but it is amongst my lowest 5 zelda games personally.'eh'  
If the fact you got it legit isn't good enough on its own, I think you probably should have powersaved yourself.  

All you are doing is saving yourself time, as long as you keep the pokemon legit, there is no reason not to do it.  
Not everyone has the time or patience to fuck around with time-wasting RNG until they get a genetically superior pokemonExactly.  
Most of OoT's ranking power comes from nostalgia, and the people where it just so happened to hit the exact right 'amount' of everything.  

But taking any one "thing" seperatly, it has been outdone by a different game by now.A bomb dropped at your feet doesn't kill you either (unless you are at low health obv.).  
Hylians are pretty sturdy, most likely a result of natural/passive magic protections they have.  

That's probably why they placed the soldier in the middle of the fortress in the remake.  
So you are forced to atleast do a part without it, and so you are more likely to stumble upon him when you actually need it.What are you talking about, it obvious stops that one useless argument.  
Totally worth it, seeing as it is the reward for the longest quest line. . .&gt;There's a couple masks that seem pretty pointless (scents? Dancer? What, will I use those like one time?)  

3/4th of the non-shape shifting masks are essentially useless outside of their one intended use/some funny reactions.    

&gt;I am hoping the masks get cooler from here on out! 

Sorry to pop your bubble, but they won't.   
If you have the transformation masks, the bomb mask, stone mask and bunny ears, you essentially have all the interesting ones covered.  

Captain's hat is fun and gives me some minor 'feels' when using/obtaining it.  
Gibdo mask is cool to get, but then becomes somewhat obnoxious during it's intended use.  

.

My favorite transformation mask is Goron, least favorite is FD.  
My favorite 'regular' mask is probably bunny hood, simple cause of how usefull it is.  
Though the dancing and marching masks are really funny  

Worst mask is the couple's mask.  
Design doesn't resemble anything decent imo, it has a boring/redundant use, and is a very boring reward for what is essentially the main 'side quest' of the game.  
The sun/moon masks that are wasted to make it were ~~ten times~~ infinitly better.  
Not to mention they probably could have come up with something cooler for the sun/moon masks' use.  

My True series-wide favorite mask is this though : http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IXpGiD-6SXs/VMe9JzRG6yI/AAAAAAAAD2U/KR2GV7Dwcxw/s1600/news150127_03.jpg&gt; Bayonetta 2 looks leagues better than Starfox Zero and was displayed on the gamepad and TV too  

I didn't show two different (both-intensive) things though.  
Rendering the same screen on both isn't comparable to rendering 2 "main" screens on both screens, it's much more intensive.  
Sending the signal for the same screen to the gamepad and the TV is hardly any work.  

&gt;It's honestly inexcusable that people will settle for Starfox Zero having graphics that don't take advantage of the Wii U hardware

I think most people simply decided to reserve judgement until we got footage that was closer to a release build.IV and EV values are barely "part of the game" tbh.  
They put no effort into learnign you how to do that shit.  
That would be like saying some obscure physics exploit in some game is a "major part" of the series.  
it might be for the hardcore, but it barely affects 90% of the playersI don't powersave, but I also don't give 5 shits about EV and IV  

And breeding/training at the level we are talking about, is most definitly about IV/EV  
Whenever someone posts as "Childhood game in HD" picture, people always remark on how that is how they used to see their games in their mind.  

I still do that,   
I have no need of insane graphics and complaining about the lack of it.  

It is about as useful to me as a color blind option, nice to have for those that need it, but irrelevant to me.  

.

&gt;Bingo. This is also why Mario Kart 8 doesn't do things like let a second player use the Gamepad as their own screen or let a solo player use it as a rear-view mirror. Both are obvious features, but it wouldn't have been technically possible because they decided to focus more on the visuals there.  

Hell, MK8 even tones it down a bit when you do 4 player splitscreen already, and that's all on the same screen.  
Hyrule warriors is another perfect example of the double screen layout requiring sacrificesIf you got a lot of success by doing the same thing over and over, and not doing so resulted in a lack of said success, what would you do?  

Simple fact is, many content creators that have "stupid" content, have it cause it works.  
Why do so many lets players scream like little girls and act all hyperactive ?  
Cause Pewdiepie does it, and is number one, and generally, the more "obnoxious" a lets player is, the more success they get for the same amount of effort  
sure there are exceptions, but the hyperactive squeeky  lets player is definitly the most succesfull version

etc...It doesn't even fox, it has like 5 furries in it, and not a single one of them is Fox from Starfox^^tmMajora's Mask is far from the best game imo (it doesn't even hit best Zelda game for me)  

It's a great game, but it has a LOT of flaws in it, most of which are even just objective flaws.As I am loving 5, I would LOVE Venom snake.  
Especially if he has **ROCKET PUNCH!!!**He was  clearly talking about twitchplayspokemonFire Emblem has the same amount of reps as Zelda.  
Zelda hasn't had a newcomer since melee.  
Zelda is the second biggest first party/third biggest franchise in smash.  Sadly, the 2D zelda games don't matter as soon as it is about representing the series....  

(Smash and hyrule warriors :/)[I voted for Goku](http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Goku)Your face is Your momIt's the same for everything.  
Once something is popular, even if it is not the most well made or whatever, it will rise, untill people get sick of it, and then the next over-done thing rises, etc...Where have you been the last couple years ?!?He really wasn't though.  
He is as much a "newcomer" as "Twilight Princess Link" was.  
His name changed from Young Link to Toon Link, but they fill the exact same 'concept'If they are so easy, you shouldn't have had an issue reaching the bottom.  

Eh, I'd say for  most people, Xenoblade is the other end of the spectrum.  
just trying to hard with little gain.  
Story was just a very standard with the only things that you couldn't see coming being stuff you had no precedent for knowing.  
Essentially "lol so random" but then for drama.  

And the combat is also extremely hit or miss, it's either great fun, or extremely boring.  

For example, Xenoblade chronicles X's overworld exploration and shit looks amazing, but I won't play it cause the battle system will just make it a massie chore for me.No, won't happen.  

It has nothing to do with "not nice to assume"  
Making a (practically already established) character a transgender is a risky move, ESPECIALLY so for a Japanese company.  

Nintendo has had transgender characters before, but a pre-existing character (even on the "changes" between games) is extremely unlikely to ever be one.  

&gt;  It's not gonna get upvoted because it's not a discussion worthy of having.

Why isn't it ?  
You shouldn't have to upvote like gwinbar said, but you shouldn't downvote a thread that isn't doing anything wrong either.

meanwhile, "my suicide prevention story" (really glad for them though) that doesn't belong on /r/Truezelda is well upvoted.&gt; Something like Tri Force Heroes (which doesn't technically star Link)

It does though, it is clearly still Link.Know you joking, but the point is still that LoZ is still with 2 semi-clones (2links), a one-off character (sheik) and a clone of a completely unrelated character (falcondorf), while not having had a newcomer since Melee.  

It really could do with getting Vaati, or Ganon, or SOMETHING.Rude.  
I constantly see people hoping for [Goku](http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Goku), I'll admit I never expected him to be so popular, as I didn't think Y\u016by\u016bki was that popular but still.  
There is no good reason he couldn't be in.A "narrator" commercial that is pretty well done, pretty rare imo.You don't have "one vote" though.  
PS: 90% of the people in thsi thread wasted their vote, probably more.Same, he is the series main villain afterall.Except that system doesn't work.  
it has been done time and time again.  

Sumple fact is, the suicide story isn't a discussion, this is a discussion.  
Following the rules and purpose or /r/Truezelda, this one should not be downvoted, and the other one should be removed.  

(although stuff that has to be removed always takes a long time seeing as the mods aren't very active here)thnx

(PS: I do think it would be awesome if eh was added though, every game with multiple playable characters should have one based on Journey to the WestYeah sure, that explains why Hyrule Warriors has over 15 characters that aren't smash and that's just the 3D games.  

Following that (retarded) logic : Fire Emblem only has a couple of archtypes, with the same being repeated over under a different name and haircolor.  
With only the lords (or in case of Robin : Might as well have been a lord) ever being added in smash.  

&gt;who matter to the series  

.

&gt;Fire emblem has hundreds of characters,  

Only 2 characters in fire emblem can be said to "matter for the series"  
That's Marth and Tiki (and through tiki, Naga/divine dragin)  

&gt;Fire emblem has hundreds of characters,  

Hundreds of characters, about a dozen archtypes and even less uniqueness amongst them.  
Even more so if we only consider important character for smash.  

LoZ has way more characters that are actually more then a new name/sprite/haircolor slapped onto a previous character.Uhm, yes he is.Sheik is only in a single LoZ (not even a really big role in that one)  

Only reason she became a staple in smash is cause she used to be glued to Zelda.&gt;.&gt;I don't mind that she is in, but I do think its sad when a one-off with a small role (even if ti was "the" most popular zelda game (not the best selling one though) gets in while the main villain of the series isn't in (not in his main form) and his alt.form isn't even using a fitting moveset.I am saying : &gt;If they are so easy, you shouldn't have had an issue reaching the bottom.
You seem to fail to grasp the point of a discussion.  

You don't downvote a fucking discussion cause you think it shouldn't/won't happen.  

The entire point of a discussion is to discuss, a premise you disagree with/strongly doubt will happen is perfect for that.   
Over half  (closer to 3/4th) the characters in this thread don't stand a chance.  

I couldn't care less about downvotes.You just wrote a comment of over 15 lines, this discussion thread is already creating more discussion then most other "shit"posts on this sub.  

PS: you are right on this : 
&gt;

"Should the main character of the next Zelda game be a frog", "Should the next Zelda game be a first person shooter" and "Do you agree with the timeline in Hyrule Historia" are all discussions with wildly different values.  

Namely, that there is no value in "disagreeing" with the canon timeline.I'm not thoow ok, lol.  

Sorry, a different guy made some stupid "LoZ doesn't have any useable characters" comments so I missunderstood yours.  

yeah, not to mention the links being semi clones and ganondorf being a clone of a completely unrelated characterI'm not tho, I am linking to who I meant quite clearly, if I didn't link to which goku I meant, I would be baiting, sure.  
but there is a difference between baiting someone into a pitfall, and someone smacking away your warning sign and running into the pitfall headfirst cause they WANT to see what allows them to complain.TBF, almost all of those rules have been broken before.It's without research, that's why stands can be grabbed by non-stands.  

PS: the dio/sakuya one wasn't that illogical, I heard she can stop time infinitly, so realistically, Dio would only have ever been able to fight her for his own duration, after which she would have been able to just slit his throat and move on.  

(Though giving a character infinite time stop is pretty retarded)That's you not partaking in the discussion.  
not the same.  

I could go onto ANY discussion and act like a fucking assholish tool by just answering "yes" or "no" or "maybe"  
That does not reflect on the context of the prompt.  
the best posts to have ever grazed this subreddit can easily be replied to with a "no discussion comment"  
but that's just cause the commenter is being a dick, not cause the topic isn't a discussion starterthen you wouldn't be able to see the other fightersI think the entire point of the requim stands is that they transcend human understanding with their powers.  

I mean GER isn't exactly a clear cut example of what he actually does either.  
Sure, the end result is "clear", diavolo is perpetually dieing till infinity.  
but... HOW is that his power.  

Same for SCR, end result is (somewhat) clear.  
but what exactly it entails isn't explained as the main characters wouldn't be able to figure it out themselves.Would be interesting if they added 1 character based on the JAP votes, one for the NA votes and another for the PAL votesI'm just gonna link [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/2edftu/the_wonderful_101/cjyg19a)  

It's hands down my favorite WiiU game, and I expect it will eventually only be beaten out by ZeldaU.Dio did regenerate after his fight with Jotaro for some time.  
And Dio did stand up and leave in this fight afterwards.  

So they sorta didn't forget it.  
it's just the what's her face left before DIO stood upShe could just stop it once, cut him in pieces and walk away though.  

That's what i meant with giving a character infinite stop time is retarded, there is no way a character with it can lose against anything unless the other character also has some form of ability allowing for that.Even if they did, I doubt they would just mindlessly pick the highest voted character.  
And frankly, I doubt either SK nor Shantea are first in any region.&gt;No such thing as a rational fear  

yes there is.  
Any fear you feel cause you know it is dangerous, is a rational fear.  

I do not have a phobia for heights, but when I am 500 meters above the ground without a safety railing or whatever, I "fear" to idea of falling.  
Simply cause if I did, I would be dead.  

Irrational fear might not be something you can "logic" away, but there is definitly such a thing as a rational fear.&gt;They are harmless yes, but tell me seriously, if a big ass spider was hiding in your boot and when you stuck your foot in it climbed up your pants, You would also be at LEAST a little bit freaked out.

I actually went to sleep yesterday with 2 big spiders within arms reach of my face.  
Knowing they are close gives me comfort.  
I would probably "shake" my leg more cause it would tickle then from them climbing up me.  

But like the other guy said though, you get a free pass on being afraid of spiders cause you are from australia.  
In fact, I think you guys get a free pass on just about anything.Stories like these always seem so foreign to me.  
Only thing close to those idiocies in my country, I can remember is some idiots making a fuss over Sinterklaas and his black petesIt's just the current spin of the Zelda Cycle mate.  
Come back in a couple years and "everyone" will be swooning over windwaker.  
etc...

I know right ?  
But I personally think all this overuse of the run and jump buttons are what is really cheapIn the SBR universe, everything is His fault.I'd actually enjoy a reality in which Dio and Jonathan actually become the friends they pretend to be during their college/university days.Jotaro's dad was gone cause he was famous and busy though.  
Jotaro himself actually divorced his wife.no way to tellThe thing that impressed me the most from australia is the plant that makes your skin hurt so hard that people and animals have commited suicide because of it.Hair is decided by Father in Awakening, with the exception of Avatar-birth-right.  
Lucina's mother doesn't matter in any way for that aspect.Chrom and Female Robin  

Horrible supports, but the story scenes make up for it.  
Having Lucina decide to kill her own mother makes that scene much better.  

Alternativly, Male Robin with Lucina for the same reason (also : Chrom the Grandpa)  

Most of the people that say : "this doesn't belong on /r/gamegrumps" probably don't give to shits about whether people downvote or not though.  

I mean, they aren't wrong, they're just assholes.  
But they have a valid point.  Your comment implied otherwise, as it is removes any need for the maiden to have blue hair.  
Apologies for the assumption.Very dangerous if you can't focus and your job requires constant deligence though.Yeah, it has popped up now and then, sometimes it is coming from some wacko group in the Netherlands, sometimes it's over here in glorious Belgium, etc...  

But atleast it is way less common/idiotic as : "This fad is DEMONIC and turning our childeren into japanese mindcontrolled spies !!!"Yes exactly, Jotaro's dad however, was merely abroad, and probably never even heard about Holly's condition.  
And Jotaro himself was practically an adult, not like with Jolyne where the dad left at a very young age.  

Jotaro's dad was (AFAWK) a better father He was talking about a different reality in which Dio and Jontathn became vampire buddies.Jep, it's a very serious "powercreep" issue in a lot of stories, where they just give a super OP power to a villain (or even to a hero at times), in order to boost the "epicness level" even though that is the lazy and stupid way of doing so, and creating a good level of "strife" is much more enjoyable.  

I doubt Majora's battery pack will make it into smash, he didn't even make it into hryule warriors untill after Agitha.Shame it isn't the twilight Princess version.  
much better than the Majora's battery pack version.He isn't doing that though.I know, still a shame they went with the dweeb.I thought P:M was always called "melee jr."I meant a moveset inspired on the TP Skullkid.  Putting powers like that into either the villain or hero's sides means power creep has already won.  
From then on out, you need to give every single character power like that in order to make it workI never said anything about that specific whateverthefuckitis though.  
Simple fact is though, once a character can freeze time infinitly,  you either need to give that power to everyone, or else find some other bullshit reasoning as to why he doesn't just solve everything like that.You can refill your lantern in the shop infront of the temple immediatly, and there is NEVER a time where you need the lantern without there being some way to refill it nearby.  

the real reason you need to save the cat is cause the shopkeeper won't sell you the slingshot until you do, and you won't be able to progress without showing of your leet slingshotting skills to the kids.I disagree.  
All of those "long" openings allow them to create a setting for Link's situation and have new people learn the game.    

Majora doesn't have to have anything to do with Termina either.  
Skull Kid stole it from Happy Mask salesman on his travels, it could have been from anywhere, there is no reason it has to be from Termina originally.I actually don't, cause I don't give 2 shits about it and it already left my mind before I even finished reading your comment.  
You never heard of Ruse?  
I ruse, you ruse, he/she/it ruse, we ruse, study of ruseology, Come on Toffee, it's first grade.I said it's a shame, I never said i expected it before the other one.  

PS: i already saw he does have a puppet in his moveset, so I'm already somewhat satisfied.  

What I would have wanted more then MM skullkid and that had a chance would have just been majora without the useless bagageyes, the DLC knocked the ball out of the park.  
It should be the other way around.  
the full game should have the serious shit and fitting story, and the full out fan service bullshit should be reserved to DLC.The second I read that there was a difference between position and label for memory I knew they would get stuck at it XdDiffuser should have the gamepadare you sure ?  
Cause that page doesn't match up with what they are asking either.That can happen now with the pc version too.  
You just need to hope the player wants to play the actual game.That's for the final rank.  
You unlock stovepipe sooner.None other then Oliver, Champion of Beauty !!! could be so.I think the joke is : "till it gets wet"You also seem pretty skilled at the shadow clone jutsu.You could just have the manual in front of you.  
Either way, the final stages of the game can't be won solo, you'd need like 4 people giving you answers to different puzzles at the same time.  

There is no difference between screencheating for the pc version or the gamepad version, you just have to trust that the players want to play the actual game.I think they'd just make papi seem more older, or simply not make her a "marriage candidate"  

But probably they would just make Papi look like an adult, but with a somewhat petit frame.I don't think it would work.  It's even better when you consider Tingle also needs Link's boots.Cause most people don't sacrifice their pikmin, even if that unleashes their special ability.&gt;Number 7 Blue Pikmin | No big shock with Blues being at the bottom with the introduction of Winged Pikmin basically making Blues almost completely useless and basically making them the Aquaman of Pikmin  

You do realize aquaman commands a nation with an army powerfull enough to give the entire world a run for their money right ?  
And that he is almost as powerful physically as Superman   
And that his trident can control water (not to mention his people have martial-arts/magic that use water)  
And that he can speak/control sea creatures, which doesn't just include the little cute fishies people laugh with, but that that also includes krackens, giant sharks, giant monster-crabs capable of ripping tanks and shrugging of explosions and even... chutullu himself, which not only exists in the DC universe, but is considered a sea creature.  
etc...  

Aquaman is one of the most powerfull DC heroes there is.  

.

Also, back to pikmin.  
Please tell me how you will kill those tadpoles/fishes in the water and how you will start lifting/destroying stuff in the water with pinks.  Played all of them to (t)100% completion without a guide.  
Windwaker is my favorite.  

I'd have to go for Windwaker or Skyward Sword.  

Windwaker for the travel experience, as it is my favorite game, and frankly it is perfect in anyway except for : "Imagine if they had put in more"  
Skyward Sword for the story experience, the way it ties together many of the other games and referenced many of them (before they even happen in-lore) was amazing.  
The "wake me up sleepyhead" scene, the Demise curse explaining the eternal trinity of the series, finally having a reason to care about the master sword, etc...Yeah, he uses Link's boots for his badges too.   
(specifically his defensive and utility badges) 

Not sure why you would avoid the best character in the series as the plague though.shut yo mouth, tomatoes are fucking amazing.It's to prevent your pikmin line from "jamming" if the 'next' pikmin isn't within arms-reach  of you.Tetra's flintlock pistol and cutlass is practically guarenteed to go the way of Sheik's harp and so forth, with the different versions being hyrule warriors based OC designs.  


Lol, person expressed minor distaste for skull kid and immediatly people act like he just insulted their higher deity of choice.  

I'll do you one better, this skull kid is nothing more but a useless battery for Majora, and putting in either a design based on TP or majora itself would have been better.  Tingle is way fucking better then skull kid (mm) has ever been mate.  
Not to mention TIngle is much more relevant to the overall series than some battery/generator for the actual villain of the game.I personally just think that they used the wrong transformation mask for young link.  
A moveset based around his goron/zora/deku forms would have been more interesting.  

Fierce Deity's gimmick of being totally op and laughably balanced is funny and all, but Fierce deity is such a small and insignificant part of Majora's mask...Rauru with Kaepora Gaebora would be fucking sweet though.  They could have, but they didn't.  
They did so for several weapons tbh.  
For example, Zelda's other rapiers aren't based on anything either.  

PS: For skull kid, they could also use his deku trumpet from Twilight Princess (which would be fucking awesome)  
Although it probably won't happen.Walking around in sunken hyrule stings the most for me personally.  A sequel will happen, give it time.  
Hyrule warriors legends is essentially just a port with some (albeit pretty big) changes.  
It probably is using a smaller team than the original did.  

Most likely this one will sell even better (bigger instal base on 3DS) and that would only support an eventual sequel even more.Only problem would be that the animations wouldn't match for those, so it probably won't happen.Truth might hurt, but it's still so.  
MM skullkid is a pathetic character whose only use in the story was to be a powersource for the actual villain, tingle has his own spin off series (only LoZ character to have so that isn't Link)That's a wobbly bridge you are crossing though.  
Where does it end ?  
Before you know it, people are using "whatever" words they feel like to mean something, even when saying said word would mean something else.  

Grammar nazi's should honestly be thanked, not hated.  
They provide a valuable service (assuming they do so politely) to non-native English speakers wishing to improve.In what way?"If one sword has a power of 100, then two swords have a power of 200."

It's common sense.  
When it happens it ussually gets downvoted.That reasoning is about as likely to succeed as the idea of : "Up and Downvotes will be able to maintain a subreddit without the interference of mods"The day being "a bit weird" is a reason to avoid someone/something is the day you have officially become ["that guy"](https://youtu.be/BJEvhi2OlEY?t=6s)[You are forgetting the golden rule of comedy though](http://i58.tinypic.com/20ht6x1.png)Thank you,   
point remains though.  

Leaving something be and saying : "It'll solve itself" doesn't work 99% of the times.Your prime example is a horrible example.  
Those quick time events are things that only happen like once, and the alternative would have been pushing an "action button" time and time again, or having it all happen automatically/in a cutscene.  

Nah, there are things you can do with the c-stick that don't really work (well) without.  
So go for it.Except aquaman isn't useless in anyway.  
He is superstrong, super versatile and has defeated more things on his own then some characters have done as part of their carreer, teams and solo added together.  
he also has a bad ass hookhand.Now I just want a Brewster one.eeeh, old aquaman was also way less useless than you imply tbh.  
It's really more a joke that originated from people only knowing his "talks to fishes" power and nothing else.I think most people would just be glad with **A** metroid game at this point in time."It's to remember some button combinations/order"  

I fail to see what is weird about it.TBF, this fandom has no idea what it wants 95% of the time.&gt; It should be a cutscene, what's the point in having QTE in what is essentially a cutscene?

To take the control away less often/in a lesser extend for the player.  
**YOU** might not like it, but a lot of people do.  

It makes it feel much more like you are doing the action, as opposed to some character with your camera feed taped to his face doing it.Is Metroid really that different ?  
At the time of release (or even before it) people have complained (in growing quantities) about the last ~4 or so games.  

People complained about echoes and corruption  
People cried their fucking eyes out about Other M  
People are already flipping their fucking shit over Federation forceOw yeah, could be.  
and IIRC, Zero Mission got the typical "A remake instead of a new game!?" hate.&gt;That's a wobbly bridge you are crossing though.  
Where does it end ?  
Before you know it, people are using "whatever" words they feel like to mean   something, even when saying said word would mean something else. &gt;From the way things look on this topic, most people don't like QTE, given all the top comments are about how they don't like QTE.   

yeah, cause a random reddit thread is a good way to poll opinions right ?  
There is also a big difference between good QTE and bad QTE.  

Either way, having a 1 minute cutscene with some button presses inbetween and where you can look around yourself is a lot more enjoyable for a lot of people then having a 50 second cutscene where you might as well go take a piss since there is no player interaction.  The problem is that idiots are taking your comment as : "Holly is not a grump" as opposed to : "Holly's channel's content is not directly related to the grumps"Phantom pain as SEVERAL moments in the game where you have control during what is essentially a cutscene.  
walking outside with code Talker, Sitting face to no-face with skull face in the most amazingly awkward car ride ever, almost the entirety of the hospital escape, what are you even talking about man.  

MGSV is FILLED with "scripted gameplay" (which is what the QTE's in your example are)  

&gt;If you're really so not-engaged that you need QTE to keep you there otherwise you'll just go take a leak, then that means you're playing a bad game.   

I meant that there is no player input, as opposed to "scripted gameplay with QTEs"  Guess what, we will also never have a world with no war, does that mean countries should just say : "FUCK IT" and go have one war after the other ?  
We also will never solve world hunger or poverty, does that mean we should stop supporting people less fortunate than us ?  

"perfection" can never be achieved, but it should always be strived towardsAll of the scenes I talked about were shown in the trailer but whatever.  
Shouldn't have used a game as an example if you haven't even finished it.  

The entirety of the first walking part is you pressing "forward" after which V.Snake crawls over a set path and tries to get up at set prop pieces.  

Also, every single time you counter someone in QCQ is a QTE.  Could have been that one that they lost the footage from (the one with the Rick and Morty guy)The quick time events in your example vid of CoD were way closer to the MGSV scenes where you can look around but have to do certain tasks now and then instead of just watching the tasks be done.  
They are "opposites" in the way that head and tails are "opposites" of the exact same thing.  
both are situations in which they give some form of (limited) control to the player in a situation that would otherwise be a cutsceneWell Metroid got it chance during the prime-era, and it didn't succeed during it.  
You can hardly blame Nintendo for putting it on the backburner/trying some new things with it, after that.  

and frankly, the amount of bullshit crying this fandom does is never "understandable" in any situationThere is a difference between using a word for a new situation and just used the wrong word.  
Your is never gonna turn into you're.  
And wail/whale isn't a case of a "new word" being invented, it is a case of people using the wrong word out of 2 similar sounding words.  Well you use one as an example of "this sucks" (QTEs during cutscenes) and the other as an example of "this is great" (Scripted gameplay) despite them being the same concept just used slightly differently.  
(Opposite side of the same "limited control" coin)   
So I think you do imply one is better.  

Either way, QTEs aren't inherently bad, and people love to circlejerk over them.  
they are essentially the game-overlapping current version of the "navi is so obnoxious right ?!?!" circlejerk and so forthI really hope it doesn't happen though.  
Linkle has got to be one of the worst ideas everLet's list of all the reasons for her "needing" to exist. 
(some of these also apply to the "we need female link in the main series" argument)   

"We need a female Link" (despite that not even happening in the main series yet) because  :  

- Link is an 'avatar', and female gamers need to be able to relate to "him" better.  
(Aside from the fact Link isn't a True "avatar" and is much more a character lately  then his original 'intention' was.)
Ok, so why not ask for a skin for regular Link then, instead of 'making do' with this knock off "little sister/female counterpart" that would only have like 1 weapon while the male (and real) Link has like 8 ?  

- "we need a female lead because : 'some reason to do with rights and shizz' "  
Ok, so why not have Zelda be the main lead, and Hyrule warriors already has an immense amount of strong female lead characters anyway (as does the main series, in fact, Link tends to really only be the 'tool', the people with real power are mostly 'evil demon-men' or females)  

- "We need a sister-character"  
Aryll, even if you don't want WW Aryll, why not just make a HW Aryll?  
Instead of coming up with the absolutely retarded name "linkle" (if anything, that name should be the name for a fusion or a ship between tingle and Link)  

- "I just like having more characters"  
As does anyone.  
But I'm sure most people would much rather have a character from the actual LoZ series (and they still have a SHITLOAD of characters to choose from) then another OC character.  
Personally, I liked Cia/Lana, cause the story revolved around them which made it work (Volga and wizzro were really just "humanoid volvagia" and "fusion of all 'undead' enemies and a wizzrobe" anyway)   
But 'Linkle' wouldn't have that, and adding an OC character in as an "extra" is just a waste fo development resources in that case.  Well there is your problem, you essentially watched one of the bad shows for him.  
The character itself has never been nearly as weak as the "jokes" made around hik implyThe sword they already have (assuming these are the result of using the four sword) is far superior to post-ss master sword though.1 Purple  
2 Purple  
3 Purple  
4 Purple  
5 Purple  
6 Purple  
7 Purple  

.

Seriously though.  
i'd probably go :  

- 7 yellow  
Same reason as for you Blue.  
if you think blues were made irrelvant by Pinks except for minor situation use, then what about yellows.  
Their entire schtick is "Can be thrown higher"  
Pink's can fly, which is way higher then yellow.  
Aside from that, their only use is to take down the occasional electric enemy/obstacle. which tends to be pretty rare and many of them can still be defeated by other pikmins with the right numbers/strategy/timing.  

- 6 Red  
Their entire schtick is : "Does slightly more damage"  
Nothing that can't be offset by superior numbers or purples/rocks, which are even way more powerfull   
They have essentially become like the yellow and blue's, but because of the purples instead of by the pinks.  

- 5 Blue  
The fact you still need to be able to go underwater, and the fact anything in water can't be done by any other type, no matter the numbers, strategy or timing makes them less "lost their role" then the other three original members.  

- 4 White  
Their poison schtuff is meh, but their insane speed makes them amazing in recovery a large amount of "pile" treasure.    

- 3 Rock  
More damage, stun oppotions

- 2  Winged  
Pretty obvious I think.  

- 1 Purple  
Nothing beats purple.  
They are the ultimate lifeformPersonally I disagree Sheik was a good example of that in OoT.  

I'd say tetra was better, and especially Midna and Spirit Zelda   

Sheik was Zelda dressing up as a boy (the body remained female, as we now know, but the "persona" of sheik is still that of a male sheikah)  
And then she still didn't do anything except teach you musical songs and getting her ass kicked by bongo.  
(in fact, if it wasn't for the design of being a 'ninja' and her role in smash, sheik would actually be one of the least impressive characters in the entirety of OoT)  

.

Either way, I personally don't think LoZ needs a female Link.  
I wouldn't mind it, but I don't see the point of it.  
As a male, I am perfectly capable of enjoying games with female or non-gendered/non-humanoid leads.  
So I fail to see why the opposite would be an issue for female gamers.  
Link has always been a dude, and while there is nothing in the lore to prevent him from reincarnating as a female, I don't see what the game would get out of it.  
If being a girl doesn't change anything for the game/story : why bother  
If it does : people will complain about sexism or whatever.   
If we are talking about "breaking the Link mold" I'd much rather see a game in which Link is reincarnated as a Goron or some other race as opposed to "female hylian"  

.

Putting Zelda, or a different female character in a/the main spot sounds a lot more interesting to me.  
Although I doubt we will ever see a game without Link as a/the main character.  
Though again, I find gender to be one of the most boring aspects to define a character with.  
I'd much rather get a game with a goron/zora/subrosian/etc... helper over a game with "a girl" as helper.  

Either way, my previous comment was really just to show that even if people WANT a female Link/lead character, "Linkle" is a horrible way to do it.  
And especially so in a game which is supposed to bring LoZ characters together, not make up new ones the entire time.Obviously they would play League of le.... ow... wait...  

...  

nvm.You sure you weren't working for Riot ?[Dan called it a grumpcade.](https://youtu.be/ISHBwW5y4Bw?t=6m30s)Or they scrapped the guest grumps idea, or changed guest grumps to people they aren't friends with,etc....  
Who really knows, not like there is anything really to compare it to, seeing as the only Guest grumps is Jon era.with nothing having come out of it since.  
Wouldn't be the first idea that was lost in production or anything.Off course they were.  
it's like the day where there was a 7 minute episode and people freaked out over it, despite the other videos of that day already having more "extra" time then was lost anyway.  

People in this 'community' just love to complain over everything.  

The checkers "IRL face photo" freakout is the perfect example of it.&gt; I mean the point of the game is to design fun games, and share them with friends. 

So, if me and said friends find autoplay levels fun, doesn't that mean I am doing the exact "point" of the game?  Offcourse she isn't.  
That's cause she isn't an awakening/fates character&gt; which is sad because he probably put a lot of time 

Most likely, this was the issue.  
he worked on it for TOO long, which caused the script to be very *wishy-washy* on many subjects, and drop important shit for others, etc...Very late reply but : A Link between Worlds also does NOT remove the "tour" in any way.  
It merely makes it so you get a list of tours you can choose from, and a 'checklist' of items to take with you on said tour.  

And because of the way the item system and "do whatever order" dungeon system work, the puzzles/dungeons rarely use more then one item at a time.&gt; Its not like Arin is advocating for stripping games of narrative-focused experiences.  

he practically does though.  
He hates it and holds it against the game when the game tries to add "magic fantasy babble" into the scenario, etc...  
It also hardly *fixes* the "being taken on a tour" *issue*.  
You are still taking a tour, it's just a bunch of smaller tours you can do in which order you want.   
Like, you can either go check out the pool first, or your room or the bar.  
Just make sure you "rent" the right item for each tour.   

however, each seperate dungeon 'section' is most definitly still a "tour" if he feels the need to consider it that way.So, you calmed down yet?  

Only one that had his head up his ass is the idiot that made a thread expecting people to fall in line with his finger pointing, while in reality, BIG SURPRISE, nobody fucking caredThey played checkers and used their IRL faces in the thumbnail.  

Everyone pretended like the first sign of the apocalypse was the grumps "becoming like standard let's players"Justice is the one that fought Polnareff in his hotel room with the cursed doll.  

Judgement is the Enya's standRight, my bad.Next home console will almost certainly have backward compatibility though.Looking pretty nice mechanics-wise so far.That was fun as fuck though.It would also only work for the 2D games, and the zelda 2D games aren't as popular as the 3D ones.Baseless conjecture.  
There is no good reason for them to not have it be backwards compatible, and will in fact help with the eternal "launch-line-up" issue.  
There is no unwanted baggage beyond maybe the gamepad, which they could easily start selling seperatly, if the next home console doesn't come with it standard to begin with.  

You shouldn't trust reddit's "business experts"   
they have almost never been right about Nintendo's actions.tip  of the 'berg babyHe called it grumpcade.Sure brah, whatever makes you feel more justified.What are you talking about?Cause 3D is 'cooler' and they tend to be more accessable.  

Though I fail to see what you mean with "being better at being Zelda games"  I thought it was a system made out of pure energy that would integrate with your physicalityThat's not the same.  
The 2D zelda's are way easier to make.  
And they still do well, just not as great as the 3D ones tend to do.Exact opposite my *friend*  
Backwards compatibility to a system that bombed means people will have many games ready to play on launch.  

Gcb bombed too, and the wii still had backwards compatibility to it.&gt; respectable difficulty and better puzzles.

Only Zelda I and II are "difficult" in any (decent) way though.  
They already did.Definitly a remake.  

a same-gen remake, but a remake all the same.Multiplayer : Smash brawl (or the smash series as a whole)  

Singleplayer : Legend of Zelda : Windwaker ( as well as the LoZ series as a whole)The battle system sucked for me, even after 'trying' to take down the superbosses.eeeh, I personally didn't get into it either.  
Don't remember how many hours in I was, but I finally called it quits when I got the furry guy that is an assist trophy in SM4SH now.  The point where the fallen hero timeline happens makes no sense.  

I've spoken about this many times, but in order for the Alttp background story to work, Link needs to be defeated before pulling the master sword.  

However the "god's word" point of origin for the split is Link dying during the final battle.  

.

The big reason why it should be before the timeskip : 
Ganon**DORF the thief king** breaks into the sacred realm **with his band of thieves** in order to obtain **the triforce** and got sealed away by the 7 "wise old men/sages"

If this happened during the final battle, then GANON wouldn't have had a reason to enter the sacred realm, cause all pieces of the triforce were already in Hyrule.  
The 7 wise old men also don't match up to the 7 "new" sages in OoT  
But they could very well line up with the "ancient" sages we also see in TP.Nice to see he atleast uses the puppets from the better skull kid.  
Now I'm just hoping he gets a costume based on it.    

looks like there ill also be a bit of a story segment about him.  
So I am assuming both WW and MM might have a bit of story.  
I hope we might see some Termina maps in that case.That event could easily be : "Link undoing the damage Ganon did with his wish on the triforce"   
SS works the same way as OoA.  
With any changes happening in the altered past "catching up" with the present.  

For example : in SS you plant the tree of life in the past, and when you return to the present, the tree is fully grown, and Groose still remembers a time when there was no tree there.hehe, nice edit opThat is also how OoT works BTW.  
If you go back to Young Link, then plant some magic beans and go back to adult Link, they will have grown, even though they weren't there on your first adult trip.Cause gen 1 and 2 fell outside the current "link-cycle""Am I the only one" type of posts are fucking shit anyway  

offcourse he isn't the only one, you never areNah, quite the opposite.  
Time travelling through an object like the pedestal of time, the time gate and the harp of time merely has a "stabilizer" worked into it.  

All of these situations do not "travel time" as much as they create a link between 2 time areas  
A warp across the fourth dimension, no different from warping between two 3 dimensional areas.  

When something changes in the past, it creates a relevant change in the future that causes the issue to be resolved.  
In the area inbetween, nothing ever changed.  

Zelda's time travelling at the end of OoT was different, and caused the timeline to be split into 3 (or 2 if the fallen hero happens differently) as it did not "fix" anything in the future.  
Most likely, this is cause Zelda's time travelling was a one-way street, as opposed to a "connection" of two moments in time.  

All other instances of time travel merely have a "paradox preventer"  

(PS: SS also had the whole "timestone" stuff which created temporal bubbles where the living "past" stuff could actually move outside the area, turning them back into the "present" bones stuff.&gt; Except that's inherently contradictory. Either it doesn't change, or it's always been the revised version. The only way around that is to have two branches of the timeline. 

Not really, You are forgetting this is a universe with magic.   

&gt;  It did fix something though. And 'fix' is a vague word. Mechanics have to function identically. You can't just pull out the rug as soon as you lay down the groundwork.  

There are multiple ways too "fly", why wouldn't there be multiple ways to time travel, which follow different rules and receive different results?  

See, the problem here, is that you assume time travel is this straight-line thing that has to "function" the same as it does in any other work of fiction.  

Name me ONE good reason why it can't be that there are like 3 ways to "time travel" which all follow different "rules"  

&gt;Right. :\ I'm not sure how I feel about those bubbles. Made for some fun mechanics, but I'm not sure the logic is sound.  

It's fucking **MAGICAL** time travel, there is no guarenteed "logic" to it.  
You have a stupid piece of stone which seals someone away for 7 years because he pulled a sword out of it.  
Where is the "logic" in that?!?st

&gt; There shouldn't be a need for a 'paradox preventer' because paradoxes aren't logically possible. If you have a paradox, you did something wrong.  

Except because of the "preventer" there is never a straight out paradox.  

Either way, the very fact we have a split timeline already implies there is a paradox involved, cause else the timeline that doesn't get altered by the time travel (adult timeline in this case) would have seized to exist.  

The very fact the adult timeline EXISTS, already means there is a paradox. I strongly disagree on that.  
LoZ is not a series you should play if you are looking for "respectable difficulty"  
Even the first 2 are only so because of... questionable... reasoning.&gt;Backwards compatability did not make the wii a hit. The appeal of the waggle gimmick + wii sports to people of all ages, including many non-gamers made the wii a hit. Backwards compatability was an afterthought made possible by the fact nintendo chose to NOT make the wii a graphical powerhouse.

&gt;The wii u has backwards compatability with the wii and it's the worst selling console in nintendo history. So backwards compatability clearly didn't help sales much, did it?  

I never said it did in any way.  
Re-read my comment, you clearly filled in some non-existant blank with your own (funny tasting) words.

&gt;Nintendo hasn't said much about the NX, but they have said repeatedly that it will be an entirely new concept - not exactly a ringing endorsement for backwards compatability.   

the wii was CONSISTENTLY marketted to be "something different" as well, even when it was still "revolution"Hmmm, I was under the impression he praised Link for it, but it seems I was mistaken.  
Although the very fact the tree is now there already creates a paradox on account of that meaning Link has no reason to go back to plant the seed, and thus the tree not being there, and thus Link needing to plant the seed there, and thus the tree being there and thus........  

And the timestones are also still inconsistent on that aspect.[eeeeeeeeeh](https://youtu.be/z2Gue6Um2OE?t=38s)  
I think that is some serious leaps.  
I think it is much more likely that Link fails somewhere during OoT, and that Zelda, or someone/something else, creates the split (probably even unknowingly, as in their timeline it most likely looked like "nothing happened" ) trying to prevent/reverse Link's death.  

Although my reply was over Zelda forgetting who Link is between aLttP and the oracle games.**NINTENDO SEQUELS**

&gt;Wand of Gamelon, Faces of Evil, and Zelda's Adventure. I also wouldn't be too surprised if they are somewhat based on the general idea of "(woodland) fairies" as mildy-evil/annoying tricksters  

That combined with her easily being a bit of a ... "special" case could easily be the reason.Kokiri girl also believes she will die if she leaves the forest (as all kokiri do)  
yet at the end we see them all at the ranch, VERY happy that they will soon all be dead.  

also : 
&gt;All the stalfos in OoT are skeletons, boney and obviously shirtless, that's a terrible argument.   

Exactly, and as the very sexy [Serb](/u/serbaayuu) just pointed out, Hero's Shade is **NOT** boney, and does not look like the TP Stalfos **AT ALL**It could very well be that people in that get lost in the Lost Woods do become Stalfos,   
it's just not a guarentee nor is it clearly the only way that Stalfos are 'born'.  

Although TBH, Based on most of the Stalfos' troughout the series their skeletal structures, I sorta doubt Stalfos' are the remains of humans/hylians anyway.She is probably just a bit of a bitch, as well as possible a bit of "elven snobbishness" 

With which I mean : a race that does not know the fear of death (on account of being age-immortal) will probably look down on species that do as well as not realize what they say is dark/mean/etc... when talking to said races.People just want to feel 'offended/hurt' over this sort of stuff lately.  

If they really cared *that* much about it, they wouldn't have an issue with meeting up with people.  
If this happened before the internet age, they wouldn't even have known about the damn costume.  
and now that they know about every little funny thing they can't easily obtain, they refuse to work towards it.  

Not to mention this costume will probably not even be that great, it will probably have a very *meh* effect or something.Seems very likely.  
In general, the other forms of time travel all seem to create some sort of "tunnel/gate/door/etc..." between the two moments in time.  

While Zelda seemingly just send something back without create a (somewhat lasting) "connection" to said time.They didn't look over it at all.  
That was the entire problem.  

Those were essentially the whole reason that Nintendo has since turned into the *big brother* of trademark licensing.The worst part about Fairy Tail (imo) is that in many moments, you can feel there is so much potential, both in the story and the writer.  
and then... BOOM... Natsu does some stupid new attack and breaks down one of the [twelveunbeatablegodsofwar] or whatever in a single hit for no good reason.Starring :

&gt;You're missing the point entirely. Not everyone has friends that even own a 3DS. I personally only know two: my husband and his friend. Both of them live in Canada, and I live in the US. What am I supposed to do, walk around and look for people that own a 3DS? Then what, "hey, you wanna play triforce heroes?" Something tells me that's not going to work.   

Ever heard of the internet ?  

We SEE they don't age, or at the very least age VERY slowly (physically) , as they look the same after 7 years.I didn't stop because of rikki, it's just that at that point i was no longer able to force myself.Yeah, and even ignoring dying, he has been "critically injured with no hope of recovery, even if he survives he'll never fight again" just as often, and he is still dregging along.  

(not as retarded as Might Guy's non-death in Naruto though)What ?  
Sorry. but imo, TP skullkid is way more interesting then fucking batterypack useless mm skullkid.  Exactly, and people can't stand the game not being designed 100% around them. cause they are little sensitive babies that need the whole fucking world to revolved around them.  Exactly.  God, please tell me you were half-asleep when writing.  

Do you really not realize what the internet can allow you to do ?  
Fucking arrange a meet-up if you need that last fucking costume so much, FFS.  
This is no different from stuff that you unlock through streetpass, or stuff that you unlock through online while you have no online.  

It's a single extra costume that rewards people for playing local multiplayer.  
And people are pretending like they are locking the entire game away behind a paywall or piramid scheme or whatever.  
Fucking get over yourselves.Why?  
Cause you people think too simplistically to realize the internet can be used for more then browsing reddit and linking your systems too ?  

Set up a meet-up with other people that need the costume if it really matters so much for you, geez.  Just amazed at how ignorant people will pretend to be in order to feel justified in raging over something like this.  
Merely the drop that caused the bucket to spill on this community."best experience"  
As if a single costume is gonna change the experience of playing the game, dear god.So Nintendo should only ever market to the lowest common donominator so that nobody can ever feel like the game isn't catering to their situation correctly ?  thank youOooh dear god.I got that spoiled just in time, and was able to prevent it :3Not really, we all known they came up with that reason after wanting to dress her like that.  

You can still dress her up in clothes, and the person that had her "condition" before it wore full body clothes eitherwayIt's a bit of a shame it removes the chance for 100% completion though.  
I'm hoping for a patch where you can re-capture quiet by simple replaying her 'boss battle' mission.Purple.Not at all.  
Like, even further away then OoT is from S64Maaah right, he said that himself.  
Kojima is a bit like Huey.  
Lying so hard that he believes it himselfVery strange choices.  
Wooly world is already out in most parts of the world, lots of games aren't even mentioned, etc...

Either way, It's Zelda U, and for a game we already know more about : Triforce heroes.  
both ar elooking great.  
Though honestly, I think I'm hyped for the entire list (and most games mentioned in this thread) except for terraria and Xenoblade CXMagic in Fairy Tail is even more loosely explained than stands in Jojo...  Making the same game between old and new "standards" is a lot easier, but generally, non-indie games have become WAY bigger, both in scale and production.  

The teams that are one single PARTS of games these days would have been the entire company before.  &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Spiny Suffocation is exactly the sort of level you'd expect Arin to make, with the learning curve built-in into the gameplay, and it's clever how you can take two paths. Both of his levels generally felt like Mario levels.

I strongly disagree on them feeling like mario at all.  
mario almost never forces you into awkward jumps/situations like 3-block-sized hallways over infinitly spawning spinies.  

&gt;However, we've mostly seen Ross's levels, and a lot of shit has been talked about Ross's levels. And yet, I don't recall a single level of Ross's that required you take damage to complete it. Both Arin and Jirard's levels do, and I feel that any real stage in gaming SHOULD be reasonably solvable without taking damage, even if that's unlikely.  

On the other hand, Ross also almost never gives you any powerups (his little cheats not considered)They are holding their hands/arms to the side though.  
That is clearly not a [stroheim salute](http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/518i1BnxtXL.jpg)The totem mechanic didn't work as well with 4, and in general : balance/design worked beter with 3Man, /u/serbaayuu is gonna be sad.Cause they didn't buy those phones just to play the games, while you did do that with your portable gaming console.  

I just wished we could get a Four Swords Adventures re-release for WiiU or 3DS (prefer WiiU with 3DS linking, but both would work)oooh god, here we go again.I can sling that way back at you.  
"Creating" a game has become easier, sure.  
but because of that, the minimum level of quality a game needs to have in order to be seen as "good" as gone up.  

Making games has really not become "easier/cheaper/etc..." across the entire line, and the only person overestimating anything here is whoever thinks they did.&gt; almost never

There is a reason this sort of thing is in only a handfull of levels, cause it isn't fun.   
And even so, many of the ones in your example are still not actual limited jumps.  The voiceacting seems a bit awkward, but it looks great otherwise.[Subtly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVAhW4ToLFI)If they so silly, why you guys leeching of their langauge ?"TP wasn't loved"  
Guess that explains how it was the BEST SELLING ZELDA TITLE ever, with only Ocarina of Time re-claiming it **IF** you count the remake/VC sales.    
Also explains how it got almost nothing but positive reviews, etc...  

But, I guess Arin is just going off of the current stand of the Zelda Cycle.  It's not saying anything though, it's just repeating the same vague shit, some of which is even working against each other.  

Ow, so it needs to be simple controller-option-wise, but it also needs to be backwards compatible (and thus allow for all the controllers the WiiU allows)  

Not to mention it is telling Nintendo to just turn the way of the other two and become a weak fake-pc with nothing unique to it.  
Which is the exact opposite of what Nintendo should really do.The main difference in Darksouls is that in Darksouls, the big bosses tend to be the easy parts, and the ganging up of smaller creatures is the hard part.  

In Monster Hunter, the small monsters might as well not be there from a difficulty perspectiveThis was back when Soccer was played right mate, when you didn't avoid tackling someone because of some stupid pansy with a wistle and color-coded cards, but when doing so would mean the entire opposing team would try to give it back to you, on or off the field.Mario games are never "the same" game, each one has made differences.  
Saying they are, would be like saying all platformers are the same game.And most likely that was cause you weren't aware of the Konchu's location, or didn't take measures to stop it.  

Something like a "regular" enemy parrying you and one-shotting you, or a single small enemy stun-locking you to death on its own is something that never happens in Monster Hunter.  
admittingly, in Darksouls it only happens till you git gud (or more realistically, learn that running through/past small enemies is the way to go) but still.His reach,  
and if you don't fall for the cape, he also doesn't have long-range projectiles.  

In general though, his weakness AND strength is in being the all-around.  
He doesn't really excell at anything, but he also doesn't suck at anything either.Peach is a nurse though, not a doctor.It also wouldn't work for SM4SH, cause I assume you mean he would use his transformations, which the 3DS can't handle.If you are gonna be mad at him for commenting that he agrees, then just downvote him instead of yelling.Thank you.He's already in it though, twice even, he does that floating and finger lazers stuff.In what way would Krystal not be realistically unless taking very loosely ?  She is first party Nintendo and part of the main cast of her series.  So I guess you also want them to remove Fox then?There might not have been a FE  that was a "bad game", but Awakening was a "bad FE game" imo.Honestly, I don't get the Paper Mario more then the Inklings.  
Paper Mario is fucking awesome.  Awakenign had less to do with "expectation" in terms of quality, and more about design choices, which will now become the norm because of how many new people Awakening pulled in.Not Mario's series' fault that they have so many awesome characters  
Paper Mario has no representation though.FYI i was being sarcastic.They really don't change enough between each itteration though.  
ussually you have a couple that are pracitcially unchanged, followed by one that changes a lot of stuff, and then being very minor "updates" style new stuff.  

Let's be real here, yes they change, but not nearly enough to be a yearly release.eh, if FE can get 5 characters, i don't see the issue with giving the best Mario side-series an awesome character with a shit-ton of possibility for a moveset.&gt;Thats such a copout, Fire Emblem has a 3 different movesets, a semi clone, and a clone, with tons of moveset potential with many different types of weapon, spears, axes, tomes, so theres no reason to even consider giving paper mario an edge on moveset potential.  

Sorry, but no.   

Not a single character in fire emblem has as much stuff to pull from as paper mario.  
(which is logical, because we are talking about simplified class-based characters as opposed to the single main character of 4 games)  
You could make entire movesets out of just his own moves in 64/TTYD, his partners, the pixels, the party in SPM, ~~a sticker-based one~~, his PJ moves, etc...  

None of the characters in Fire Emblem have anything beyond : "he uses this weapon instead of another" or "they use a horsey, a winged horsey, a scaly winged horsey, or can become a scaly winged horsey" 

Almost all of the fire emblem characters their moves are made up, with only a handfull of their animations beings taken from their actual actions in the game.  

Robin being the exception because he uses all the magics.  

Hector or Ephraim would be the same thing again, their sprited existence merely means they have all of maybe 5 poses/animations to take over, and beyond that, all you have is : "this guy's weapon is different"  
Hell, best part is, for Ike, they didn't even give him his signature move (or more specifically, what is 'signature' about his half of the legendary twin blades) : the ability to fire shockwaves.  

&gt;Mario, Luigi, Peach, bowser, yoshi, rosaluma, bowser jr, and if i would even count both wario and dr. mario within the mario reps.   

Guess what, "Mario series" is also like 5 series in one, and each of them sells  better than the average B-list series does. 

ps: Dr. Mario is indeed a mario rep, but yoshi is a yoshi rep.



[Jow serb](/u/serbaayuu)  
Is it just me, or is it a couple years to soon to start seeing TP praise and SS hate specifically because it isn't tp ?  

Zelda cycle speeding up or something ?The one thing I would like to see for this won't be in it though.  

(darned cut content, I need my iron-head shadow beasts)There is the Serb remake-salt.  
I knew it couldn't be far away :p  

You know what buddy, on this one and WW:HD I agree.  
I could see OoT and MM needing a remake because of how outdated they were, and especially MM was updated really well, but WW and TP really didn't need one yet.  Assuming this will take the path of WW:HD, I'm not that impressed.  
If they really want to remake these games already, they should atleast be adding in some of the cut content or something, but so far, none of the (3d zelda games) remakes, whether they be 3D(s) or HD versions, have done so.  

ALthough i will commend them if they at the very least add in the ironhead shadowbeasts.Haven't they done this for every wii game so far ?all the wii games have been 20 so far AFAIK, with a 50% reduction on release.Ugh, another bunch of wii games I already own coming to the VC Xd  
Man, this is unprecedented.  
I feel like a biologist that is starting to notice the mucking up of the ecosystem by harmfull "alien" species being introduced to it.  

Dunno man, I already though the WW:HD one was strange, but fucking TP which is still 'last gen' accessable ?  
It seems like Pokemon has become their version of an annualized series, and Zelda is gonna become the one with as many remakes/deluxe versions as there are game on their own or something.  

(PS: if we are getting all this remakes anyway, when is Zelda II HD coming ?!? If we are really going down this path, i better get my HD thunderbird)&gt;I was okay with Wind Waker exclusively because they were using it to learn the Wii U, but otherwise it's much worse overall than SD.  

WW is my favorite game ever, but honestly, I think that if they really wanted to remake it that soon, they should have gone the full trip and added in some cut content or something.   
And otherwise it was too soon, but I guess them using it to "learn" the wiiU and then not just throwing away what they got is somewhat of a good reason.  

&gt;I haven't played MM3D and don't intend to but the dumbing down of the Bomber's Notebook etc. is upsetting.  

I don't think making the bomber's note book less confusing/less random on who is written in it is "dumbing it (the game) down"    
And the much better boss battles (and much more details in the world) make THAT one feel like the "definitive" version   
IMO, MM:3D is the best one out of the remakes they have done so far.  

OoT:3D was also good, if only to remove the very obvious aging signs on OoT (and finally slap some... well anything really... onto "hero of time's" emotionless face)  

Honestly, if they really wanted to remake some games...  
There are a bunch of 2D ones that could look amazing with higher detailed sprites or an ALBW/TFH look that are way older than any of the 3D games...Well me neither beyond the first 2 sets, mostly cause I already own all of them anyway... but AFAIK, all of them have been 20, and 10 during the releaseweekMaybe the worst of all : now the news of this *remake* is probably gonna steal away attention/hype from an actual new Zelda game : tri force heroes...&gt;It won't make any difference.    

.

&gt;Made a difference for the Augment Your Preorder campaign.

That still doesn't guarenteed it was "it" (aka people nagging about preorders) that made the difference.It's a great series, now if only they stopped trying to make me play it on a 3ds and went back to screens that are the right size for that sort of game, and then I would be able to get back into the newer versions...None of the shit you mentioned fucking existed back then thoughI doubt all of said content would be re-used that way.  
More likely, they just didn't have those dungeons worked out well enough to re-add them in without any effort.    

Still think WW (and now, TP) didn't need a remake though.why do you put a little star next to trans ?  
It seems like you were gonna put a definition below your comment but forgot or something.And why do you expect this bigger, "arts and crafts filled" sub to be better?  

only issue with /r/Truezelda is that the mods aren't very active, meaning posts that should be removed instantly stay up for days.&gt;On a side note, where's all the love for the 2D games? There is more to Zelda than TP, WW and MM!  

Tell that to Nintendo and Koei before saying it to the fans.&gt; I think that this sub needs to give more love to the 2D games because they are incredibly fun.

Nintendo (and their team-ups) should give more love to the 2D zeldas in general.  
Tell me, how many fighters based on 2D games are in Hyrule warriors ?  
how many fighters or assists based on 2D games are in Smash?  
How many of the 2D games got remakes ?  
etc...Maybe he hates it cause it isn't glorious double dash, which is obviously still the undefeated king of mariokart games.No one is talking about that though.  
All that was being said is that 'it' won't make a difference, and then someone else said it did, even though there is no way to proof it was cause of the nagging (unlikely) or cause of it just being a whole new level of bullshit.  

Either way, pre-ordering should still be a choice.  
What really should be discouraged is complaining about you having preordered something and not being satisfied with the result.  
People that pre-order a game for the advantages and don't start crying when something goes wrong aren't an issue.dafuq is wrong with people.&gt;And that's what the movie had... Did you not you watch it?
  

no, you replied to this Well, she is the least "gimmicky" of the cast except for rachnera and suu now that she isn't a mental infant anymore.  
And rachnera has her body (lower half) to work against her, considering arachnophobia is one of the most common phobias in the world.  

Mia is also the one with the most scenes thanks to being first, and in general seems to be the one okayado likes to gives the most attention/scenes for.Well now you are just trying to farm downvotes obviously, everyone knows Double Dash is the absolute best.I think Lala could do whatever the fuck she wants tbh, considering she is an Agent of Death and allWW:HD was already way to soon for a remake imo, so TP is in the same boatI think you replied to the wrong commentIt really wouldn't be.  
Ganondorf would sooner kill himself then team up with Link.  
it would be extremely out of character for him to pull a bowser.Many people sorta did throughout the years.  I think all MM fans realized what they were seeing as soon as the distinct fire noise came on.Are we sure the region locking is also for playing with friends ?  
it could be that playing with friends is global, but random match making is continaental.Kinda strange they singled out the MM one, there are lots of reference songs in those balls.  The idea of having Ryu as a third party character had definitly come up several times in my mind, with the announcement of Megaman, my main reason of disregarding the notion was cause I didn't expect Capcom to get 2 fightersGanondorf ARE the high stakes though.  
And I doubt he would.  
I could see this work for a new villain or vaati or something, but ganon(dorf) ? no way.Ghirahim could work if it was his only way to revive Demise  
Zant could also work 

Phantom Ganon could even work, especially considering the way Ganon treats the one in OoT.  (that is, assuming phantom ganon is more than just a being created/controlled by ganondorf)  

This idea could work with just about any character EXCEPT ganondorf.  
Cause ganondorf doesn't bend the knee to anyone.  
Even when he made his both-ways horcrux with Zant, he was still the one taking charge.Not the gamecube's fault it was the fucking best.  
just like how double dash wasit's ok, we can all be wrong in our opinions now and then.  

(for real dude, I'm joking, stop taking this serious)&gt;  It would've been so simple to do

This is never True for ANYTHING in game development (or coding in general)I like to imagine all of these were filmed on different days, and they have just been running around with their costumes on for days on end&gt;According to Wind Waker, Ganondorf does what he does simply because he wants a new home for his people.  

BULLSHIT!  

Guess what, he was on good terms with the king of hyrule, someone who had already decided to accept much less humanoid species into his kingdom to be treated as equal citizens.  
AND guess what the state of the Gerudo was after SEVEN FUCKING YEARS of ganondorf being in command of Hyrule ??  

They were still inside that stupid "winds of death" desert and several of them were being brainwashed to serve as his iron knuckles.  

WW ganondorf's little sob story is nothing but just that, a story he makes up to distract Link, and convince HIMSELF that he isn't THAT bad.   

And Majora is fucking piss compared to ganondorf.  
it took Majora DAYS in order to get his "**LAND-**destroying 'spell' to destroy termina, and in the end it was stopped by 4 giants deciding to just hold the moon up.  

Nothing Majora does is impressive, people really overestimate Majora.  

Ganon(dorf) wouldn't team up to "save the world", cause GANONDORF **IS** THE THING DESTROYING THE WORLD!Some people have this idea that articles that are bad/circlejerk shouldn't earn money, but still be passed around.  

If you don't want to give them money, then stop partaking in their "product"Honestly, it is pretty dang hard to find a character more "worthy" of anything then mario.  
He has saved the kingdom/world/galaxy/etc... more times now than most entire series' protagonists put togetherThat's like half SS, Half TP, which really means it's a quarter WW and 3 quarters TP2.0 sounds like a reboot of the series.  

Metroid prime 4 doesn't sound like "dark samus will be back" at all imo.  
Prime Hunters (and likely Metroid Prime : Federation Force) doesn't include Dark Samus/Primetroid either and it still carries the name.And for a game we already know 100% certain it doesn't have anything to do with phazon/dark samus while carrying the prime name : metroid Prime hunters.Probably just the general newsletter list.Showing of your tattoo doesn't have a purpose either.  
but if it is shoddy work and you show it off here, then you should expect people to note that it is.  

If you can't handle critique, don't show your stuff on a public forum.   

And it does serve a purpose, it essentially warns the op to not go back to that tattoo parlor if they ever get another one.  they fucking wouldIf you are so sensitive about stuff, maybe you shouldn't be on subs like this.The twilight itself isn't an issue, because twilight itself isn't evil, it is merely... "different"  
However people can't leave the twilight zones (just like nobody can enter)   
And it seems like the conversion into twilight caused a reaction out of the fused shadows (creating the first 3 bosses)    
It also stands to reason the twilight zones are a nursing home for twilight enemies, and the fact the twilight bugs have access to the light spirit's power to feed on/sustain themselves.Well I would much rather see a remake for an older game than Twilight Princess, that's for sure...  The ability to see and interact with all moments in time at the same time.Kira being hidden in the background of scenes (both opening and actual episodes) would be awesome in general.Uzumaki is indeed great.  
Pretty funny how the chapters that have some level of gore  (which is, like you said, rampant in "horror" )tend to actually be the lesser chaptersHis bosses should have learned to keep the leash tighter in that case tbh.No.  It's even more much better !That already exists, it's called Legend of Neil.More like : where he allowed criminals that have tried to kill him to come have fun FUNEE JOKE!Bantu is the best manakete in the entire series.Promotion choices are great (assuming they make decent choices, and not situations in which one is ver meh, and the other is way better)  
Overworld maps (or specifically, if said maps allow you to grind) are a bad thing imo.  
It removes the somewhat rougelike feel of actually having to make do with what you get.In that case she is being held back by the forced connection to Link though.  
let's be real here.  
What about Linkle beyond the name and color scheme is the same with Link ?  

She doesn't use Link's signature gear  
She talks  
She isn't Link, nor (at this point of time, and I doubt at any) the wielder of the triforce of Courage.  
I doubt she is a hero's spirit reincarnation  
etc...  

What is Linkle doing, that should couldn't have been doing as HW aryll, or even just HW "bertha" (as in : any name but Linkle)  

The connection to Link does not support her character/role in the story, as she is not "female Link", nor is she a stand alone character.  

That is one of the big issues exactly.  
They went half and half, like make a car/boat hyrbid that can neither drive on the road nor stay afloat.Nobody knows.I did say "real"  

note that this is not really a stab at the Vita itself, but the fact the vita does not pose as actual competition.  
Whether it deserves it or not, it is pretty clear the vita is not really selling well enough to consider it a "threat" or even just a negative factor to the 3DS in anyway.ah, sorry.&gt;Actually really loved this response. 

And I love you, random citizen ! *points*

&gt;I'd say for discussions sake the only really advantage of Linkle is giving her an independent personality and identity in the game rather than "default male link but now here's a female counterpart with a pink bow or dress maybe".  

Thing is, a good female Link would not have a pink bow or a pink dress.  
She would have a green tunic, white thights and be a sleepyhead at the start of the game.  
cause that is who Link is.  
Male or female is no important aspect of Link's personality nor design in any way.  

Giving her the seperate identity is exactly the opposite of what a female version should be imo.  
It is exactly that that enforced the fact that she ISN'T really a female Link, yet is now stuck with the (failed) status of being so (and an utterly idioitc name, like really... wtf)  

&gt;
I've wrestled with this idea way too many times, I still can't decide which I would prefer but I do know and agree those two things are very different. Do we make an automous separate female entity or add Link with XX chromosome and I like your argument for the latter. I just fear they take the femshep route and marketing wise make Link the default and still reinforce the idea that FemLink is an added bonus. There's also the argument that adding a female option would also be checkmarking and seem like an afterthought rather than flesh out a separate female entity.  

That is an issue on the marketting more than on the way the game makes use of said character I'd say.  
It is a possible pitfall, but it is little different from the bad aspects of Linkle now.  
Link is still seen as the default, even more so than ever, now that she is clearly shown to be seperate.  
however she is not allowed to have a True clean slate to start on, on account of being "female Link that isn't Link"  


&gt;Personally I wouldn't be opposed to a new reincarnated Link thats female and only female and this identity becomes an actual plot point that the new hero is female which catches a patriarchal society off guard  

Only "issue" with that, is that the zelda world is always shown to be very female-supportive    
Hell, their entire religion is based around females, as opposed to the mostly male-centered religions IRL.  

That said, i wouldn't be opposed to a Female Link, at all.  
I just also don't think it would be that insanly interesting.  
I'd say a Link that is part of a different race/species/culture is a much more interesting concept over "Link with 2 x chromosones instead of an X and a Y"    
But if they ever made a game in which the Link we play as just so happens to be an incarnation that is female, yeah sure, go for it.  
I wouldn't mind at all.  (I just hope they don't do a "R63 world" then, I really don't need male Zelda, female ganondorf and so on just cause Link would be female ones... if anything, have them swap gender too whenever you want, but don't all force it into the same timeframe for no reason.)Spirits are also not a real thing (as far as Science knows)  

Therefor, the workings of a spirit/reincarnation in fiction is determined by the author(s) of said fiction.  Nathan Drake is not connected to Laura Craft, what are you talking about ?  
But asnwer this : is there any benefit you can think of from making her "Female Link that is not actually Link" ?  

Seems to me like now she is both not a good original character, nor a good "female Link", by going half and half.So, what are the right reasons to hate her?&gt; ... Give me a moment. I'm trying to imagine the implications of a female Ganondorf... but then Ganondorf is always the same, so it probably wouldn't count.

There are actually 2 ganondorfs throughout the series.  (the one in Four Swords Adventure is not the same Ganon(dorf) as all the other ones)  
Also, a reincarnation of Demise's hatred could appear in female form without having to be "ganondorf" anyway.  

&gt;The only thing I'm struggling to come to terms with is the fact that Linkle isn't "just another variant of Link".  
I mean they already set a standard for there being inordinate variants of Link across the various games of the branched timelines. I'd completely buy into the idea that one of the Links just happened to be a girl. Sure. No problem. I'd equally buy into one incarnation of Zelda suddenly and inexplicably being male. Not an issue.  

I agree, however :   
&gt;But we're supposed to believe that Linkle isn't another Link... and just happens to look very much like one as a matter of complete coincidence?   
It seems cheap. Also silly.  

Also makes her name even worse.  
They are essentially riding the "fake hype" about ehr being female Link without actually going the full way and making her female Link.  
it is baffling to me how anyone is glad with this outcome tbh.  

.

.

&gt;What do you find so objectionable about the idea of Link just... being a girl? I mean it is acceptable for him to be a wolf or a rabbit... but a girl is totally out of bounds?  
&gt;Have I mentioned that I find the entire Legend of Zelda series a bit silly with its gimmicks? The next game could be "Link is now a blind cave salamander" and I'd not even think it strange.  

Any of those, both the ones we already got, and the ones you are saying, sound more interesting to me than "2 x chromosones Link"  
I wouldn't mind female Link personally at all, but I also don't really see what would be interesting about it compared to some other "deviating from the norm" links they could mak.eWhich is why I didn't mention him with the first two.  

I do think doc is the first one that should go once lucina and darkpit are not amongst the options though.If she was the little sister character she was intended to be and she was "HW aryll" as opposed to "Linkle"  ?

Yes.  

Although I would somewhat be confused by the choice of twin crossbows, but honestly, not that weird.  
I mean, Impa has never even wielded a weapon before in the entire series and all of a sudden she is using a great sword and a naginata.

So yes, if she was Aryll, I'd be totally ok with her.  
Cause then she wouldn't be a stupid female link that isn't female link.THat is the abolsute best thing that could happen from here on out if you ask me.  

it should not be up to Hyrule warriors to introduce new characters.  
Especially so when we still have a shit ton of characters to use from the actual canon  

At most, what I would find fitting for her from here on out, is her getting a "Linkle's crossbow training" or something like that.  Differences with Tingle and Linkle  

1 Tingle is a canon character  
2 Tingle was not made to check off some checklist  
3 Tingle is an awesome character with a history in the series  
4 Tingle is in no way actually related to Link, with the closest connection to him being that he likes fairies and wears the same color.  
5 Tingle's name is not utterly retarded
6 Tingle is the sexiest shit to have ever come out of the legend of zelda series except for Dead hand.  
(ok, 6 might be a joke, not sure)  

I really don't see how Tingle is comparable to Linkle.  
Tingle was never made to be "*X* Link"   
he is just Tingle.  
at most he is a bit of a joke towards the obsessed adult fans   

Also, Tingle originated in a canon game, and worked his way up until becoming the big bulwark of the series he is now.  
Not like Tingle, who people are alreayd lifting in a golden seated fucking throne simply because she is Link with tits (and she isn't even that decently!)  

Honestly, I hope Linkle gets, at most, a future role in Hyrule Warrior games and "linkle's crossbow training"  
And i really hope Aonuma just said the whole "we are keeping her in mind" to shut people up, or to mean : "we might one day make a female Link", in which case he also means "but we will do it right"
.

Wizzro and Volga are hardly the same.  
They are monsters made into warriors, Volga is obviously just a way to get Volvagia in there, and Wizzro is a fusion between wizzrobes, poes, and a couple other undead "staples" in the series.  

I do think actual characters would have been better, but I'd rather them make "HW versions" than make fully new characters.  

Cia/lana, which are essentially the same character from a plot standpoint, were added for just that... the plot.  
The reasoning behind having them in there is just so that there is a reason for pulling all these worlds together.  

Using an existing character that fits (which there sorta isn't tbh...) would be better, but It's understandable.  

.

Linkle however, is not added for those reasons.  
I do have to say, that if they had added her with a different name, and no forced connection to Link I would have liked her more than she is.  
And if she was the main cause for the plot or whatever in an eventual HW2, or even in HWL, I'd place her on the same tier as Lana and Cia.  

but right now, she is a (very much so, for me) failed female Link, that is added for no real reason over any other character with no real reason\* as to why her side story should be about her, over any other character that could have had an excuse to go wander around and get tangled up in whacky battle reasons.  

(\*as far as we have seen now, which I will concede is not yet the full picture, though I doubt anything in the story will really shake the foundation or something.\*\*)    
(\*\* wadayaknow, they might just have done so afterall.)
I never realized how unlikely it is that it rhymes after being translated...Way to many people who think that just cause something works like "X" or "Y" in one fictional reality, or even in a lot of them, it has to work that way in every one of them.  &gt;
As opposed to... tingle? Navi/Tattl/Tael? Error? Lana?  

Uh yes, exactly.  
All of those except for Lana have more reason to be in than Linkle on the same fact that they are actual Zelda characters.  

&gt;
She is 100% objectively not Link.  

that explains why her original design concept is "female Link" and her name is fucking Linkle right?  
Let's face it, they wanted to make a female Link (which would have been better) but didn't have the balls to do so, so they made her this half-and-half.  

Not trully a female Link but also far from "her own character"  &gt; If you knew how lucky you are for being a guy in the domain of video games, you wouldn't say things like that. There is a disturbing lack of female playable characters in games (especially ones that aren\u2019t stylised sex toys), and players of all genders need more of them.

and the way to fix that is to make new female characters, instead of just strengthing the concept of "male as default" by making a "female Link"  

And it is definitly not by making a half and half between an original character and between female Link.  

if this was actually Female Link, with none of this "making it a seperate character", it would have been a lot better.Exactly.  

If she had been either just Hyrule Warriors' "Aryll" or a fully new character made to be the main character of the extra missions (or imo it would have worked better to keep it back for an eventual HW2, but whatever) it wouldn't have been so stupid.    

But they just decided to ride the "female Link hype bias' while not even making it a decent female Link.I have the exact opposite opinion on that aspect.  

If it had been a female Link, preferably in the main series, it would have been much better than this half-and-half between an original character that can stand on its own, and a female Link.  

Now she is "female Link that isn't Link"  

The much better solution would have been to just make her her own character  
(or just ignore all of this bullshit and add actual Zelda characters to the mix)Please no...  

Making a male Zelda wouldn't be that much of an issue... definitly would be an interesting plot-fake out.  
But I really hope they don't do some bullshit like a R63 world, with every single character being the opposite gender for no good reason.(well the real answer is : video game logic, but that's no fu)  

I think part of the masks' magic is to make people think you have always been "x"  
Essentially turning your very existance across time and memory into the form you currently are if people need to recall you.  

The only exception to this is people who know the form you are in better than they could ever remember/know Link.  
It would be stupid, and there is very little gimmicks in the zelda games that aren't done well imo.  

Making a female spirit of the hero, a male blood of the goddess or a female wrath of demise is all good and stuff, but I really don't want to have a "fiora and cake" situation in which every single character just gets swapped.  

There is no reason why Link and Prince Zed couldn't  just be bros and defeat some evil together.IN hyrule, being male or female has very little effect on social standing though.  
Hell, their religion is based around all powerfull females, In OoT most of the sages are female, Zelda is more often the ruler or otherwise most important person around, etc...  
So Link being born a female would not really change anything for him now would it.  

&gt;
In any case, I wasn't imagining Male Zelda to be all that different personality-wise... Zelda gotta fill the Triforce of Wisdom role, right?  

they shouldn't be different at all.Well sorry, but (for me) she is.  
She is not any kind of solution to the plight of having more female characters (one which HW is not even really relevant on, cause HW WiiU actually has more playable females than males).  
She only strengthens how much the concept of a female lead is secondary to that of a male one.  
This isn't a "baby step" in the right direction, it is taking a step after turning back, so yeah, we are "taking a step", but not in the right direction, and people are just blinded by the fact we went "forward", ignoring the fact the forward is not the direction it should be. (man, that was a silly analogy...)  

Linkle would have been better as either just "Link" or as an unrelated character whatsoever.  
As she is now, she does nothing good for either side.&gt; 
&gt; How is a canon character working their way up any different than a non canon character working their way up? If anything Linkle is being introduced much more gradually.

How so ?  
Linkle is being put into a game about bringing together Zelda characters while she herself is not a zelda character.   
Tingle is a zelda character, and has been so for years now.   
(not to mention a recurring character that even got his own spin off series)  

&gt;
This is just your assumption. Aonuma said Linkle was made in response to the popularity of her concept art, she is fanservice just like everything else in this game.

That is why she was re-added.  
that is not why people either wanted, nor what she was designed for originally.  
The fact the entire hype train about "female Link" (stupidly) took off shows that clear enough.  

Just cause something isn't explicitly said doesn't mean it isn't so.  

&gt;
History has to start somewhere, the awesome part is just your opinion.  

yes, and that start should be in the main series, not the spin off game.  

&gt;
We don't know Linkle's connection yet, or if one in universe even exists. Everyone is making so many assumptions about it, like saying she's going to replace him in a future game. How about waiting for the game to come out?  

Linkle has a connection to Link from the simple fact she was designed as a female version.  
her name is literally "link +le"  
Saying she has no connection to him from a design standpoint is going directly against what we saw in both the artbook and the way they described her.  

&gt;
His name is "tingle"... like "slight prickling or stinging sensation" tingle or how a child pronounces "tinkle"  

Yes, and that is much better than "Link+le"  

&gt;
Yeah... I don't see how any of that matters. It looks like you're just listing things that are different rather than distinguishing their cases, and most of those differences are just based on your opinions or assumptions.  

I only need a single one for that.  
Hyrule Warriors is about bringing together Zelda characters into a dynasty warriors game.  
Tingle : Zelda character  
Linkle : not zelda character  

Cases differantiated.  Pm wasn't illegal, but it wasn't legal either.  

Companies can send C&amp;Ds even if you aren't making money out of it if you are using their property.Seems like more stuff to grind adventure mode for, YEAH!!!!!!!I bet Ruto will have a laruto costume.  

Not sure what some of the other costumes are supposed to be yet.   
I was sorta hoping Darmani would have a Goron Merchant costume considering the WW content,   
but his costume based on Biggoron from PH is pretty nice too.  
Always nice to see the 2D games getting some love.&gt;Because she's not suddenly canon. If they do ever promote her changes could still be made.
&gt; What's with this elitist "only existing Zelda characters should get in" anyway? You're taking a light hearted spin-off game meant for fun WAAAY to seriously. Besides, we've already had lots of goofy originals. Should Lana, Cia, and everyone else get cut too?

wow, is elitist the new "triggerword" in order to just wave opinions away ?  
I thought we were still on "toxic" or whatever.  

Sorry that, ... in my opinion... ,it is way more fun to see actual Zelda character come together in this game then made up characters, especially if they are shoddy r63 of Link for no good reason that aren't even handled right.  

If development resources were infinite, then sure, whatever.  
but they aren't, they are finite.  
Every minute one of the creators was working on Linkle was a minute that could have gone into actual Zelda characters from across all the game.  

Also, Lana and Cia were added as the "story excuse" as to how all the worlds got pulled together/how both sides can "deal" with it.  
Their very existance as 2 parts of the same character makes that pretty clear.  
An actual Zelda character filling that role would have been better, but it is understandable that they would make characters for it, as no exisiting character in the Zelda games has shown anything of the sort in their "repetoire" of abilities.  

&gt;
That's a fault with the fandom, not Aonuma. And you're no better because you're jumping to just as many conclusions as they are.  

what conclusions?  
That linkle was designed as a female Link?  
That aint a conclusion, that is a fact we know ever since the artbook got translated.  

&gt;Again, why are we taking a Dynasty Warriors crossover so seriously? Was this game supposed to be the Zelda hall of fame? Because I don't remember it being pitched that way.  

[That is exactly how they described it, yes.](http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/08/13/hyrule-warriors-exists-to-celebrate-the-zelda-universe/97894/)    
[It was said multiple times the game was a celebration of all things zelda.](http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/games/trailer/release-date/Wii_U/commercial/celebrate-the-legend-of-zelda-with-hyrule-warriors/17834)   
[Linkle... is not one of those things.]()

And "omg you take this too serious"  
And you aren't?  
I mean, you are defending her existance just as much as that I am attacking it.

&gt;This connection is strictly meta, I was talking about "in universe". No in universe connection has been made. For all we know the story plays it off as a coincidence or never addresses it at all.
  
And I wasn't speaking In universe, i was speaking stricly meta.  
I was never speaking in-universe for that point.wow... so much wrong in this comment. . .  

ok, first of all.  
Unlike with the avatars, not all avatars have the same name.  
Each and every avatar is a different person bound to the same spirit (raava) 
All the Links are considered "link" as their standard no-name-given name.  

The situation is already quite different.  

.

Linkle is NOT a Link in the way they have her right now.  
She is a girl from a different village.  
She is not confirmed to be a reincarnation of the spirit of the hero at all.  

also, if her name doesn't matter and she is merey a female link, than why isn't she named Link.  

There are plenty of situations in which you can choose between male and female characters and either both have a seperate unrelated name (Pokemon protag.) or they both share the same name as they are the same person( Mass effect sheppard and Fire Emblem Robin and Kamui). 

Linkle is also most definitly not to Link as Korra is to Aang  
As both Korra and Aang are actually canon in their main series, while Linkle isn't.One issue with your reasoning : your entire concept hinges on whether I mind you disliking Tingle.  

I revel in it mate.  
every single time people say they dislike Tingle, my love for him grows stronger.  
Every downvoted thread about him, another chub is gotten  
Cause that is how amazing of a character he is.  

Ok, not really.  
But I honestly don't mind it when people dislike stuff I like.  
As long as they stick to facts when talking to others, I will never tell them they are wrong in disliking something or shouldn't bring it up, except maybe jokingly (mostly with DD).

.

Either way.  
Like I already repeated above, no matter how much you dislike Tingle, or how much I think Skull kid is overrated, or even how much work they put into Linkle.  

that'll never change the fact that those former two are canon, and the latter is not.  
Whether that matters to you, or me or even aonuma, is irrelevant to the fact that they are.  

You are free to love Linkle, I never stated ANYWHERE you aren't. (At most I might have dropped somewhere that I genuinly don't get the reasoning behind someone liking miss coldsteel's inclusion over that of actual characters. )   
In fact, i make it a point to very often repeat "Imo", "for me", etc... in my comments.  
So then also allow me to think her inclusion is almost as big an insult to the zelda franchise as Falcondorf is.  you don't really see them because of the positioning, but what little we see seems to me like it is quite "hippy"&gt; I hate the generic anime looking crap that everybody goes nuts over.  

hmm, yet you like Linkle don't you?Triforce quest is not a "bad bit" for everyone.No tingle tuner.  what consoles for you got ?  
Windwaker and Twilight princess are obvious choices.  
If you do not have a gcb, then the HD version of TP is coming soonish (ww:HD is already out).  
So that can be easy access for that.  

The oracle games on the eshop are the best 2D zelda games of all if you ask me.  
Minish cap is great too, but depending on your available consoles might be a bit hard to get atm.   

Tri Force Heroes is lots of fun, especially if you have friends to play with, but even with randoms or with dobbels I find the game very fun personally.  

Biggoron(PH) costume for Darunia was pretty unexpected for me.  
Always good to see the topdown games get some love.  
Although I do would still love to see a Goron Merchant (WW) skin.&gt;it's tedious   

opinion-based  

&gt;seems like an excuse to make the game feel longer  

yeah cause WW definitly felt over-long as is right ?  

I loved it cause sailing around to get stuff is the best part of WW.  Eh, I doubt it.    
The ouya was funded too remember ?Could be.  
And who knows what happens, but I doubt this will trully take off.yesLink, linkle and the other HW character have definite "anime" proportions and looks on them if we are being honest here, specifically the ones from the HW "world/time/era"  

not to mention how "generic" the trope/concept of r63 is.

Have you SEEN the eyes on all of these characters?yes Arin... Where DID the snail fall from !?!  
Maybe we will find out eventually !  

I sorta doubt they will figure it out during the playthrough though.Ocarina of Time and Skyward Sword grumpcade with PBG and Dan would be the best probably.  

Or Cosmo.


[Oingo Boingo you say??](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOjrfCdhD_I)Neither is the n3ds "really a new system"  
&gt;maybe not MM, as I heard the updated version is not as good as the N64 version in certain respects -- it's easier, the swimming is weird, etc.).  

MM:3D is the best remake they have done so far.  Flooded timeline.  
Has the bestest of games in it, and a lot of unique potential, both before the games we have in it now (#serbaayuu) and after it.he did use other mediums afterall.  
both tvs and even just the dirt.  

So it seems likely that he could do a lot with it if he really practiced/maybe if he had been younger.I never implied it was ??  
In fact, the "yeah" means I am glad over it.It is only "easier" because the controls are better, the bombernote book is more informative and they did some QoL changes.  

Aside from that, the game remains the same.  That'c cause those other warrior games are also "anime-styled"  

if that sort of design isn't what you consider "anime", then what do you count as anime?I don't see why it does that, and it is opinion-based either way.Playing it with Arin will be nothing but him either shutting himself up to prevent backlash, or him pointing out "issues" he has with the game, several off which will probably not even be the games fault.  

I'd much rather see Dan enjoy a LoZ game with someone who knows what he is doing, than see Arin complain about it.OoT/zelda in general speedrunner&gt;I don't mind if you dislike her (or let's rather say, I don't "care"). You can "think" about her what you want, that's not my business. You also can tell others your opinion, we all live in free countries (otherwise we wouldn't have access to reddit), so we all have a freedom of opinion. But you do much more than that. You keep repeating yourself over and over with great persistence. Every time (and excuse me, if "every" is not "100%" correct because you might have missed one), someone opens a topic about new characters in HWL, you seize your chance to tell the world how much you hate Linkle and give your reasons. And if someone voices their own opinion and tell you, that they disagree, you write multiple replies about why your point of view is correct.  

I write why I have my point of view, yes.  
Last I checked, "freedom of opinion" does not have a quantity clause on it.  

&gt; try to force them to agree with you  

That is called having a discussion.  
Any discussion between 2 opinions ever have always been about trying to CONVINCE the other to see your side.  

This very reply you are making, is trying to "force" (AKA convince) me to see your side on whether or not I talk about Linkle negativly everywhere.  

&gt;And calling Linkle "Miss Coldsteel" (whatever that means), is technically insulting her and her fanbase  

her ? yes.  
But then again, I also called her idioitic, useless, and out of place and shit.  
it's a fictional character, I think she can take it.  

Fanbase ?  
Sorry, but the only fans that get insulted from me insultingthe character are in it to feel insulted on purpose.  

If I said I think Micheal Jackson's Music sounded like someone killing a cat (I'm sorry MJ!) than I would not be insulting his fans, I would be insulting his music  

I also never said anywhere that people eother shouldn't like Linkle, or that they are "fill in insult here" because they like her.  
She is, not her fans.  

&gt; I'll ask you again: If someone came here and kept picking at Tingle, calling him names and would repeat himself over and over in multiple threads and fight off any opinion of other people, could you 100% silently ignore this without being bothered?  

I never said I would ignore it.  
I would reply, telling them why I feel different about it.  
you know, having a discussion on a ***DISCUSSION BOARD*** 

&gt; I'd say if you could, you could also just ignore Linkle's presence by now and the fact that she has many followers who appreciate her for various reasons.  

I **CAN** do so easily.  
I'm just not doing so yet.  

Especially not considering how many people I've had in these last few threads who had interesting debates about it with me.  
True, OP ran past the "line" for me too.  
Going from "Linkle is not the way" all the way to "No female Link ever"  
You wanna know what one of the best threads is on this subreddit ?  

[This one](https://www.reddit.com/r/HyruleWarriors/comments/3w22qa/linkle_is_terrible/)  

And no, not because of the title.  
Rather, look at the anount of comments  
And the amount of discussion that is going on in comparison to almost all other threads in this subreddit that might as well be dead most of the time.Very well worded.I think all the gods can change their size if they want.You better be ! /jkKing boo &gt; cloud
any day of the week.I'm a big fan of the Twilight Princess reveal with Miyamoto wielding the master sword and hylian shield, myselfSo, you ready to lose 50 dolla then ?Almost as bad as FE:A&gt;P.S. I think New Zelda will skip Wii U and it will be launch title for NX...
   

Not happening, they have repeated that it is coming to WiiU several times by now
MAYBE it might come to both like with Twilight Princess, but it won't skip the WiiUThat "trobe" has long since dropped/  

And Sheik didn't do shit either.  
THe instances in which Zelda took on a more active role is Tetra, Phantom Zelda &lt;- the best on in this regards and reborn hylia.  

This however, is only when talking about Zelda.  
Between the Sages in OoT, 4 out of 6 are female, 5 if we count zelda.  
The highest order of power is the 3 golden goddesses, which are female.  
The country and the main race are named after a female.  
The highest form of leadership is very often Princess Zelda.  
Many of the companions are female.  
Midna is the "True ruler" of the twilight and becomes one of the strongest forces in the game, second only to Ganondorf, who is the most important "man" in the series, and is evil, often times not even being a human.  
etc...  
Tetra is the leader of her pirate band.  

Hell, Hyrule Warriors itself has more playable females than males.  
With Link and Darunia being the only males on the side of good originally.  

Also, npc's very rarely to never talk about either gender in a superior fashion.  
I don't see how Link being a female would change anything for the story.  
And if it did, it would be considered sexist anyway.Social standing wise though, which is what would determine gameplay/story effect, there is no difference between male or female though.  

Unless you think a female Link will suddenly go "sit around doing nothing"  
Although I still find that a strange thing to say, considering nobody (of either gender) but Link tends to actually "do anything" in most zelda games.  

Smash bros shouldn't have anyone that isn't from a 2D platform games with multiple attacks based on input combinations !  
That is not the part that was opinion based.  

Also, it is easy to say "it is the shortest" if you also say"except for the shortest one"&gt; She is probably the daughter or granddaughter of a Link in any case.  

What makes you think that ?  

.

and yes, Link is active cause he is Link, and that what he fights is (sometimes, cause a lot of times the villain still just sits around doing nothing until you appear) active cause otherwise Link has nothing to do.  
(we also have had female villains already)She looks like Link cause they wanted to design her like that but then didn't have the balls to actually make her female Link, I think.  

I doubt she will have any acrual connection to Link, but it would probably be more interesting if she did.  

Now I am actually hoping for something like that myself, dammit.Zing!&gt;
It's about expectations. If Nintendo says when the game is first revealed that the game is going to be a side story and extension of a previously released full mainline game on the same console, then that's where I'm going to set the bar. 

they never said that back during MM's release.  

And WOW dude.  
Way to essentially say "everyone can have their opinion, but if they don't match up with mine they are retarded weirdos"  

Like, seriously, fuck you, I hope everything you try to buy in life is 1 more expensive than your wallet size.&gt;It's development name was literally "Zelda Gaiden". OoT was originally planned to be much larger, but when the N64DiscDrive never took off, the cut content was reused and developed into MM. It was never touted as a mainline Zelda like LttP or OoT.

and none of that information was available beforehand.  

And you say I put words in your mouth ?  
please show me where I said I prefered any of the things you said over the other ?If someone specifically guesses "nothing", wouldn't that mean that ANYTHING being announced means they are wrong?  
And even that for every new thing they announce, they lose points ?  

The real way to answer "nothing" is to post an empty comment.&gt;K, just want to make sure you recognize my empty comment just in case nobody breaks even or higher.Damn, I was hoping everyone with that idea would vote "nothing".  

Yes, but voting "nothing" is not the same as voting blank imo.  
Cause saying "nothing" means that "anything" being revealed means you are wrong, as they did not reveaal "nothing" they revealed "something"Yes, but Blank just means you are staying on exactly 0 points.  
As I didn't vote on anything, not even "nothing"But if it does....  
You know who technically voted the correct way ;)  

PS: how will you buy the DLC for people in different regions?  
Think so, yes.NOOT NOOT!Lol, then why would you care about it being spoiled?As always, this sub's rules will follow the "Don't want to be spoiled?, that's on you" principle.  

We will not moderate spoilers.  

Then those people should avoid the sub.Also not so great on keeping "grounded" when analysing Zelda U...&gt;
Well, we could downvote it all to oblivion  

You overestimate how many people actually care about not getting spoiled.Quite so, yes.And their trailers were still hype for me tbh.Won't work.I loved the Hyrule Warriors Legend leak last E3.  
Cause seeing a link too it, and not realizing what it was during the trailer was way more hype than the way Aonuma brought it up during E3Isn't lucas' victory theme the same as Ness' ?oh damn, truth bomb right here.Pacman's pose when standing still while his opponent dies is essentially a taunt on his own.&gt;Sakurai really, really doesn't like Zelda.  

Not even just the character.  
The Zelda series is Nintendo's 3rd biggest series.  
Yet it hasn't gotten an actual newcomer since melee.  
It has 2 (semi-)clones of each other, the main villain is a (semi-)clone of a completly unrelated character, the titular character is consistently bad and the best character it has is a pretty minor one-off character.  

.

My personal theory is that Sakurai wanted to make a Legend of Zelda after melee, but was denied, and so he vowed to never again add characters to LoZ's line up.nothing.hmmm ?Same way a 10 y. old stops evil organizations on his own and a hedgehog runs at the speed of sound to stop an eggshaped scientist.Zelda getting a newcomer.   
Wolf coming back with a new final smash.  Part II might just relapse if they'd announce that.I actually think Sora would have been more interesting/fitting than Cloud personally.  
Even though I'm not at all a KH fan myself.  

Chibi Robo would be pretty cool.  ikeI bet the fairies will be in 3D in the game though...K  

Though I really don't see how being in 3D or not constitutes "anime"  
Fire emblem characters and Shulk are often considered "anime swordmen" in smash, and all of them are "in 3D"  

Also, quick question, if the fairies were in fact in full 3D, would you suddenly find them fitting?Compass is useless without knowing how to work with it.  
Especially if this is most likely gonna be some "magic compass" that doesn't point North but instead points towards destiny or whatever "compass trope" they will use.Wasn't it specifically the players he was harsh on?  
Maybe he thinks the character could do it, but none of the current Falcon mains can.Cause Sheik is still better ?Don't make a post like this again.That's the 20% discount you just described.  
You should try contacting the hall where you ordered.For me it most definitly was.  
Went with a friend, had the best seats, great fun.  
I wouldn't have traded it for anything the world can realistically present to me.[Goku](http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Goku) fits perfectly amongst the cast, he is a Nintendo character afterall.Personally I'd much rather get Ganon, Tingle or Midna+Wolf Link or something, but at this point, I'll take anything (from the main zelda series)He did so for the Direct/cloud reveal didn't he ?  

So I'd guess he'd do it for the broadcast if he has the time for it.  
Eitherway, I'd say this isn't the best place to talk about this.  
if you want him to see it/ask hima bout it, then send it to his twitter or something.Reggie and myself  I would like a Co-op game in 3D  
Not sure why it would have to be a "four sword" game specifically though.  
TFH is essentially a Co-op game just as well but it isn't a "four sword" game.  

.

One thing I would love even more is if there were multiple characters/races to play as with each bringing their own role into the game.  

Like, imagine a "Four Sword" game coupled with the "concept" behind the 3 transformation masks of Majora's Mask.  
So you would have a goron, a zora and a deku working together with the actual Link.  

.

One way I think a co op zelda in 3D (or even in 2D) could work outside of the level-based structure is to essentially make it a single player game where other people can take control of the other characters.  

So if you play solo, you'd be able to swap between the characters to use their powers when needed.  
You'd essentially just play through the game as if you are playing a regular Zelda, except with multiple people.  

I do think this would work better with 2 people, atleast for the first time/game.  
In which case it would work somewhat comparable to the gongoron section in PH and Phantom Zelda in Spirit Tracks, except with the option for one person to take control of the other character.  

Some issues it could have, especially with 4 players.  
Is that you'd essentially have to rush all the characters together, or havesome people not have a character to play as at first.  newcomer : Bandana dee obviously.  

But with such a small roster, it might be better to put some narrative into it.  
Maybe also change the gameplay to a level structure....  
and wouldn't it be sweet if it was co-op instead of competitive ?Very nice cosplay, though I don't get the near nakedness.  
ganondorf has always been fully clothed...  

I mean, I "get" it, as in : "it's a girl cosplaying, therefor : skin, especially belly",  but I don't *get* it...Yes, and he went on really big "what if the refractured light might mean that vampirism is part of the story??" type of tangent.  
not actually that one specifically offcourse, but he did suddenly start going on a tangent about the birds flying away when links appoached (something that has been in the series since A Link to the Past mind you, and the only reason it wasn't sooner is because Zelda I and II didn't have wild animals anyway) being a possible "hint" at stealth being a major part of the gameplay and such.   

That's what I mean with "grounded"   
or just, sticking to the facts.  

if you only took what is actually an analysis from his "analysis", you'd probably have like a 5~7 minute video at most.  
And most of it would be spend on the big sword, and the book with a sheikah symbol on it.Hyrule Warriors is a vastly different game.  
It also has very little of what I mentioned aside from the option to play solo and co-op    

For one, there is no puzzle or exploration aspect to HW.  
As such, the different also characters do not play different roles in this aspect.  
Nor do you swap between them (or atleast not in the WiiU version, the 3DS version will add this, but it isn't for the sake of making use of their different abilities)    
HW is level/mission-based, as opposed to the "free roaming story" aspect of the main series.  
In fact, just about the only comparison between HW and what I was proposing is the option to play co-op or solo, with nothing else matching up between the two.  

&gt; But if you want to have a more typical Zelda design with the world and the dungeons, then that will be very hard to do, because you can pretty much expect the players to all be everywhere, making co-op pretty difficult.

It is only hard if we assume needing to keep every single player's game updated.  
You could just be playing the game all the same as normal , except multiple people would be going through the story together.  

ALternativly (for online), you could go for a Dark souls system, in which everyone goes through the story solo, and you can "enter" your friends game in order to help him out.Hardly so.I'd like it, especially for the WiiU version.  

No way it would work for the 3DS version (getting the WiiU stages) though.  True.  
also, I don't mind them "making stuff up" or making long guesses...  
Just don't do it in the analysis.  

They used to have "our and your ideas"videos, which would talk about "theories" behind stuff, or guesses etc...  

Essentially all the "maybe this points at X or Y" things/random thoughts that aren't actually supported by the source material.  

Just bring that back, and voila, an extra video release without watering down the actual analysis and artifically lengthening it.Not in TP I didn't.  
Which this is the ganondorf off of.  

And If we follow that logic, than this ganondorf should not even be wearing any armor, or should be wearing an iron knuckle suit with a blank stare on her face.  
let's be real here, this has nothing to do with the gerudo's clothing, which is just cloth-based.  

This is a girl showing of her (admittingly nice) body while cosplaying.    

&gt;
Uhhh, multiple characters and races to play as? That is literally 98% of Hyrule Warriors' gimmick. While you pick what characters enter instead of being assigned a goron, deku, and a zora, those are still races present in the game. They also all have at least somewhat unique powers, which means you will be swapping to make use of those powers and succeed, and their powers ARE relevant to your strategies and success in the game. 

they really aren't.  
there is nothing in the game that Darunia can do, that any of the Hylians or ruot or etc... can't also do when it comes to what it results too.  

All they do is deal damage,  
Darunia does not have something like "only character that can walk over lava" or something.  

to see what i actually mean with that, just look at Majora's Mask, in which every form has their own skillset and "role" to play.  

&gt;While I disagree that there is "no" puzzle element to HW-- certainly its puzzles are really stupid puzzles, but there are some 'get object a and use it to solve problem b' tasks, and I could argue that the necessary strategies are puzzles in and of themselves-- obviously it is not a classic game, which I addressed when I said "more classic adventure/gameplay".  

IMO that's not really a puzzle at all.  
That is like saying a counter move in a fighting game is a puzzle.  
or using a green shell to hit the person in front of you is "using an item to solve an issue"   

Either way, the focus isn't on it at all, and it is barely a part of the larger gameplay, not at all like the main series.  

&gt;
However: I just don't believe a truly "classic" Zelda game with co-op is feasible, anyway.   
I challenge you to find a game capable of co-op that doesn't utilize quest-points/stages like Triforce Heroes and (arguably) Hyrule Warriors do. 

Minecraft  
Don't starve together  
Darksouls has an area-based one, which could easily be extended to worldwide if not in a game that is paced like darksouls is.   

For the game to handle the entrance and exit of new players, the levels/quest-points/stages are pretty much necessary. 

Not really.  
It is only needed if both players are supposed to be getting the "main experience" and if both players their "savefile" needs to eb updated by doing so.  
You could quite easily just make player 2's "file' not be affected by the progress made in the game.  
like most co-op games used to be back in the day anyway.  

&gt;
 You'd have to use a system like SS's Surface Bird Totems to select an area to play in, although obviously exploration would be a feature there where it isn't in HW (largely due to Outpost things and nature of the strategy it employs). Creating another co-op game will likely go just like TFH did-- major emphasis on co-op puzzles.    

Again, hardly so if the second player is merely taking on the role of what would otherwise be a secondary character/ai companion

&gt;
It would be cool to have other races, but we kind of did have the whole "swap for ability" thing in TFH's clothes and tool systems.  

Which is a good starting point, but very, very VERY limited in its execution.  

&gt;A more linear storyline would make it "more classic", but in the end Nintendo has talked about making the classic Zelda less the defining Zelda, so...  

The fact it would have co op is already not "classic zelda"  And who is to say this isn't ?  
Last I checked, whirlpools do not have bedtimes.  

I also don't know about genetically engineered thousand year old sharks that are bred to be able to operate complex area design and the workings of mechanisms.  

And fine.  
If we want more "realisitic" setting   
Opens a cave/ruin for the first time in thousands of years.  
Has firearm ammo in it.  


ah, yeah I could see Sakurai do that just to spit on the zelda franchise more.  
Good point.Last I heard, Shovel Knight isn't even RELEASED yet in Japan.Shut up dude.  
Don't push this sort of threads of to us.The minigames in Amiibo festival would probably work pretty well for on mobile.  

I don't know if NX would be "too far" compartivly.  
We know they are not actively working on AC:U, so if the next platform were to come in about a year~2years or so, and the soonest they'd be able to make AC:U is about a year+....  

Then I'd say
It could be a great launch title for the next platform with just a little extra wait.&gt;I concede the point on puzzles, but maintain that there are slight differences in strategic strength of each character in HW (if overleveled enough any of them can do anything, but there are missions where one character will be much more successful than the others would be at similar levels... also, Sheik's Harp abilities are definitely unique to her/him).  

It is "unique" but it doesn't do anything special.  
Every single mission can be solved by every single character.  
this isn't like in TFH  where each item carrier has a role in some of the levels, and it most definitly is not on the level of the transformation masks in MM or PhantomZelda and Link tagteaming in Spirirt Tracks.  

&gt;Minecraft is a sandbox or survival game (depending) and DST is a survival game; they don't (or at least their co-op iterations don't) have plot-driven gameplay, which doesn't seem like something the Zelda games are willing to give up just yet.  

really no reason why the concept wouldn't work for a story game though.  

&gt;Dark Souls' system is one I am not entirely familiar with, but I believe you have a point there. I'm not certain how easy the expansion of it would be, or how well it would work with a Zelda title, but I don't know enough to firmly agree or disagree.  

I also have another one : Spyro, Dawn of the dragon, has Cinder and Spyro go through the entire game together.   
With each having some abilities unique to them, and in singleplayer you can swap between them.  
there is a max range you can move away from each other, etc...  

&gt;
I think having only one player's save (or neither player's save) updated via co-op would be received poorly  

Not if it is couch co-op  
Dozens upon dozens of games have this.  
HELL, HW has this.  
If I play Co-op with a friend on HW on his file, I will not gain anything from it on my hope computer.  

Alternativly, you could still make it that the game places you on the "story part" of the one who is most back in the story.  
And that if you go farther than the further ahead player, you'd start taking both with.  
Stuff like collectible gathered and rupees obtained are kept either way, etc..  

(assuming Twilight Princess:) So I you just beat the forest temple, and I just wrastled some gorons, and we play co-op, I am "summoned" to your location, and once we get too the goron wrastling, anything we do as a team from then on, is remember in both players' world.  

Stuff like finding heart containers would give the container to both players assuming neither had found it yet before.  
otherwise the guy that didn't have that one yet gets it, and the other gets a simple material or ruppee reward, or even nothing, just the reward of having helped your friend.  

I really don't see how this would be an issue, especially in a mostly linear story, and with a game build around it too allow for it.  

&gt;
In the end, however, I'm tired and I don't think I'm seeing what you're seeing. It's probably more me than you; as I said, tired. Not really running at full capacity right now, lol. I do think Nintendo should develop more co-op titles, because so far they've been pretty darn good at making them fun, but they should probably strengthen and streamline their online stuff a little more before they really take on different types of co-op and innovations in that genre.  

True, but the thing is that I am neither "expected" this game, nor saying it should be made tomorrow morning.  

I'm talking about in the future, and if they want online, then especially so after getting their online shit together.
&gt; 
&gt; It does make me wonder about the removal of depictions of the Triforce from MM3D, though. We can infer then that knowledge of the Triforce in Termina has largely or totally been forgotten. Obviously, it can't have been destroyed, or Termina would be a dying world like Lorule. Well, it is dying during the game, but for different reasons.

Haven't watched the video yet, so not sure if you are specifically meaning theorywise or not.  
But I think MM:3D's removal of the triforce just shows the developpers didn't like how people just assumed it meant something, and decided that Termina does not have triforce imagery in it afterall.&gt;
I make the assumption that a female Ganondorf would look a lot like one of the Gerudo, because well Ganondorf is/was the only male Gerudo and if you reverse the gender you're right back to being a female one.  

which would mean she'd wear either the normal garbs, or the actual armor Ganondorf wears.  

.

You can say this all you want, that's your right.  
but that won't change that this is far from the only time males being "genderbent" into females completely lose the armor, for no reason other than : "lol girl version needs to show that bod"  

If it was actually inspired on female gerudo wear, than I'm not a fan of the design, as it fails to capture either of the two designs in a logical evolution and fitting-wise.Eh, I think with some minor tweaks here and there it could definitly work.  Who knows, maybe we just get the costumes when we unlock the characters or something...  

I really hope we get "it all" on wiiU though.It's almost as if Skull kid is Kalle Demos again......I dunno, I'd really love to play the story in co-op on the superior WiiU version.  
The adventure map isn't as important, although I'd still love it, but the story would be so much more fun to play through on the WiiU.I think anyone who watched Boogie' most recent vid should know fully well why Boogie would like that sub.  

&gt;How about telling the man what he'll like, dislike, and hate about the place. 

generally, telling people what their opinion is on something is not considered a good thing.Alessi with Sethan could potentially hit him and revert his age to before he was the ultimate being.  
if it was then day, he would die in the sun.  It depends, the explosion is apparently not capable of taking care of "restoration" as Crazy D can revert people in the middle of the explosion effect just fine.  
So if Kars his body would regenerate as fast as KC would blow it up....eh, it is really more of an "extended" version.  
THe vast majority of the game is still the same as the U version.  They explain why they put it there though.  
it was released after the 2014 listing. Would be nice, but it would mean revealing the "placement" of the ballot votes, which i doubt they will do.  

the ballot was most likely not a vote.  
It is a suggestion box.   

Just cause character X got ten thousand votes more than anyone else doesn't mean he will be added for sure.  

Remember, Sakurai rules with an iron fist.  
if he doesn't want to, or does want to, add a character, he sure as hell will/won'tVery nice theory (collection).  
However the termina branch relies to heavily on wether or not Majora is even from Termina or not for my tastes.  
As neither the "death of a goddess" nor the "origin" of the shadow trive are confirmed in the canon for termina.  

Same for the Lorule branch actually... , where we only ever know off it having had "many legends" before the destruction of its triforce.\ufeff  

.

I guess my main issue in general is just that this is what happens when a bunch of seperate theories, each with their own "margin of error" are put together.  

A single minor "miss-measurement" rarely means anything, but when put together, the bridge/tunnel won't be right.Superlong probably.  
Like an hour or more probably.  
&gt; e know it most likely has a Triforce,

Do we ?  
Cause the only thing pointing at that was in stone tower, and was removed from the remake.  
In fact, out of all the worlds, lorule has been the first one with a triforce of its own.  True.  
I do find it strange how the animator who essentially became big by making video game story parodies, seems to almost think stories have no place in games or something.Well it seems to be an extension of an "issue" i had about Crazy D previously, namely : what determines (on a universal scale) what is part of the same object and what its "previous state" was restoration wise.That's not how you "recency bias"  

The fact melee got huge ahain after so many years is a testament to both the game and community.  
I strongly doubt anyone will still be playing undertale in about 5 years.Next vote is gonna be like choosing between two kids...  
...  
nah, OoT &gt; alttp for me anyway.  
Shame that the two Zeldas that survived have to fight already thoughJust noticed I didn't answer about r63  
R63 means "rule 63", which is one of the "rules" of the internet.  
The more well known rule is  rule 34 : "if it exists, there is porn of it"  
Rule 63 simple means : for every character, there exists a genderbent version for it.  Well from the latest trailer it seems like they have some small flapping to their wings.Nice little overview trailer.  

I wonder if we will get anything else announced beforehand, considering this is the overview of everything we have seen so far.*  

Maybe the My fairy thing might get a trailer of its own still.    
The official site doesn't have one of those little circles pointing to the "future video" anymore as far as I see.  

*Edit : We didn't get any "announcement" (so far) for a new villain to fill the role of the "black smoke" over hyrule castle In Le's story , so I wonder wether that means it might not be a new villain at all.  
I doubt they will keep it secret if it actually was a new character afterall.Or it could just be taken as them fucking up.  Strongly dislike it.  
It is part of the "more options, but ruining/giving up (part of) the feel" issue awakening has with a lot of its stuff for me.  Now I sorta want to see this become a running joke, with Boogie "reacting" to a lot of silly stuff.Right right, head thingy sticks up more, the lack of golden gauntlets and stuff threw me off  

same "situation" though.  Even if we were still getting 20k entries... we know Sakurai's stand on Ridley.  &gt; there will be no winners 

.

&gt;it is whoever samurai picks to become a fighter   

Which is what a lot of people would consider "the winner"Q : Would you rather know about Sakurai's stand on the matter and thus "lose hope" in it, or be left in the dark, wishing, campaining, hoping for it, but it never coming True ?Yes, it has been an issue for a long time.  
In a way even from before cosplay became popular.  
Even just regular halloween costumes tend to be more "slutty" versions of the subject for females.Well technically he can be in this universe with hacks/mods....Must be because he is only being fed those Yummy Nummy things. . .

/sDefinitly.I don't think it is the actual P.value going up that is what people dislike, but rather the fact that the content "changed" along with it.I like that we are getting one more character, but I also would have liked to have a "random" button tbh... it is hard to choose who to play as sometimes Xd.  

Although technically that could have just been delegated to a button/button combination.  

.

The one character is probably gonna be whoever is the villain of the Linkle story.I love Morths.   
Or atleast in Windwaker, they are pretty annoying in TFH.  

I always try to take one of them with me as far as I can.Yeah, Vaati is probably amongst the most likely ones out of the exisiting villains.  
They could even "copy" the ganondorf situation, with the final battle having him turn into his monsterform after beating his human form.Wow, the hearts line was lenghtened to be 20 hearts with a second line below it.  
Dayum.

E: When I saw the My Fairy layout and stuff I was almost expecting a "Pokemon Amie" or "FE:F facemolesting" feature there.  ALL HAIL /u/king4aday!  
MAY HIS FILES NEVER CORRUPT!It's just reminicent of all the other overhyped "omg this changes everything" games of the last umptheen years.  
And nobody remembers most of them after a year or two.Just like all the other "OMG THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING" games before it.Which undertale most definitly will be as well.  

Nobody but the most devout fans will still remember Undertale in 3 or so years unless it gets sequels or some form of "relevancy bumb"Thank you lord, I will use this reddit gold to provide for my Family.On a seperate note : could this be the return of PaidForWinRAR ?  
Cause frankly, this is probably one of my favorite subs ever.Quick translation.  

This translation and this story itself is the first good news about her so far for me.  I meant that you were fast at it.  
I was applauding your speed.no, no.  
Thank you.&gt;[**I**](/u/solarsaturn9) translated the opening cinematic and the narrative before Linkle's first battle  
**CINEMATIC**   
Linkle: Uhn  
Townsman: Heeeeeey, Linkle!  
Townsman: There's trouble! Apparently Hyrule Castle is being attacked by a Demon!  
Linkle: What!? REALLY!?  
Townsman: We've received word that even Zelda is engaged in battle but if the Demon gets to our village....  
Linkle Changes and bursts through the door  
Townsman: that outfit is ... ?  
Linkle: I've decided! I will defeat this Demon!  
Linkle: It's just like my grandmother once told me! I am the reincarnated hero after all!  
Townsman: Just because you've always liked to pretend to be the hero...  
Linkle: LOOK!  
Linkle: Surely this compass passed down from my grandmother is proof that I am the hero!  
Linkle: I will protect the peace in Hyrule!  

&gt;**NARRATED STORY**  
Cucco shepherd Linkle was from a small village where she lived leisurely.  
From the time she was small she has believed that she is the reincarnated hero.  
One day a rumor had spread to her village that a Demon was attacking Hyrule Castle.  
When Linkle heard this she donned a dashing green outfit.  
With the old compass passed down from her grandmother and her special crossbow in hand she set out from the village.  
Relying on a map and a compass, it was Linkle's aim to reach Hyrule castle but...  
Soon she found herself lost, wandering around in a forest with a suspicious atmosphere.  
Then a demon child wearing a mysterious mask appeared and robbed Linkle of her treasured compass.  
That compass is surely the mark of the hero and she absolutely must get it back!  
Linkle's first trial was about to begin.  

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/HyruleWarriors/comments/3wdt8e/new_legends_footage_japanese/cxvj8cl)  Hyrule Warriors getting an amiibo line would be great, simpyl cause it would allow a variety of zelda characters to get amiibo options.  

Personally I would especially like it for an eventual HW2  
With more love for the 2D games sprinkled in there.I was expecting maps based on Termina personally.  
Especially since the adventure map came over, and we now have a character from MM playable.

But I sorta doubt it will happen cause I would have expected them to show it off together with Skull kid in that case.  
but who knows really...

.

I doubt there will be a "lot" though.  
WiiU version only had Great Fairy and Summoning gate as a "surprise" on release IIRC.I hope it is alright if I spread it around with a source to your comment?  

I sorta want to spread it around as it is the best news about this game since Tridentdorf for  me.mostly it just makes me wish the WiiU version will get a "legends pack" or something...  

We finally get WW content (beyond the baton which is the most dissappointing weapon for me) and now I won't be able to play it on the best console, nor in co-op.  IIRC, they announced challenge mode, and thus Ganon's fury mode, will not come to the 3DS version.  
That is probably not really a big thing for a lot of people, but it is something.  

Also, 3DS version doesn't have Co-op, and obviously looks way, Way, WAY less good.You know what needs a remake... ?  
The CDI games  

now wait wait wait.  
hear me out here.  

What is the ultimate way to call someone out on doing something badly ?
Doing it better yourself.  

If Nintendo remade the CD-I games, as actual Zelda games, and made them great... it would be the ultimate "insult" to phillips  
(and FUCK phillips and thier patent trolling and stuff)    
Essentially making it clear : it was 100% all on you that this sucked.  

Now, Imagine if they remade the CD-I games (specifically the 2 sidescroller styled ones), either as Adventure of Link styled games, or even a complete redo into a top down style game.  

Keep the base plot, the character names/functions and so forth, but redesign the gameplay, the characters' looks, no more animated cutscenes like before, instead good dialogue and so forth.  
So king harkinian would still "take his ship in the morning", and Link would go after to save him, but it would be handled like how you would expect a plot like that to be handled in a modern zelda game.  
Gwonam would have the role of "old man/wise man/seer/sage/etc..." and stuff like that.  
Link would be a "mute" as far as the player hears, etc...  

Now, if they did all that well, maybe even fuse the two games together, with one story focussing on Link, and the other on Zelda, you'd just have the most hilariously well done "remake" ever.

Did you finish it ?Well, that conversation is still going better than when they tried to call a cab for my Grandpa back in the day.    

"And on who's name is the cab?"  
"Mr Ickx" (pronounced the same as Mr. X)  
"If Mister X doesn't want to give his real name, than Mister X will just have to walk home !"   
\*telephone slam\*I would just love the "Meta-humor" that I would derive from that situation.  

It will never happen, but it is my secret wish tbh.Jep, only "issue" is that his partners will not be able to select the later stages yet and will have limited outfit slots (they can still select "I don't care/know" though, which will make their vote moot.)Except I never did, I answered his question based on the information available.Could work.  
Only issue is that if rupeeland would be canon, we have no idea where it fits in on the timeline.  
Personally I am a fan of the idea that Tingle is immortal (as long as he keeps gathering rupees) and that all Tingle's except the one from Termina are one and the same.Same, Only thing I wished for, is that they made it so the last two people you met stayed on your bottom screen after disconnecting, so you could still blacklist them.It's not weird, cause Goht is the best boss in MM (also the one in the original that didn't suck, unlike his 3 masked companions)Probably Molgera from Windwaker.  
It's really just walking around and hookshotting his tongue, but the music, setting and design of the boss are just awesome.Can't wait until he does the one with the pink octopuss that both causes the iceberg and saves everyoneThat assumes that Tingle's adventures take place in hyrule though.NpRupee regalia is so insane.  
You can earn like 400 out of just clearing the town...  

Annoying when teammates destroy all the bushes and pots before you can do it for more money thoughWell it sorta depends on area to area.  
But in general, it isn't a very celebreated holiday.  
It's mostly just some minor decorations and some more focus on spooky things in stores/on tv and whatnot.  
But trick or treating is very uncommon in my area personally.  

I'd say "three kings" (three wise men) holiday is much more popular in my country, and who knows about the other ones...eeh, depends.  
There is no presence of the triforce or anything else like it there. 

"deku" is a very common name in LoZ, and is essentially used for all the "plant" type creatures and their habitats.  
The great deku tree could be a bit more clear, but at the same time, we don't know how many there are, or even where they might have come from originally.   
The great maku tree also has 2 versions afterall.  Except I wasn't assuming anything out of SOMEONE.  
The "assuming makes an ass out of u and me" only really counts when you are "assuming" something of someone, not when you are using reasoning to determine the likeliest answer.Honestly, all the temple bosses in MM EXCEPT for Goht deserve hate.And that feeling when you topple him by doing that perfect jump over a pillar, dodgin the lightnign, right on his back.  
Honestly, the only thing that could have made that fight any better was a mounting sequence if you hit his back just right.Barinade is probably the other way around for me.  
I remember him worse (or to be exact, he (it?) is always the OoT boss I forget about the most) but his fight is pretty decent/fun.  It's a bit like the "rule of threes"  
It can get old if it is overdone, but in general, it is used a lot because it just works that great.You "mount" it and stab it in the eye-core.  
That fight could have been a fully automatic cutscene and it would still have been awesome.Honestly, that actually illustrates the one issue with goht...  
the way you start the fight.  
because you have thaw him out of the ice, a lot of people probably assumed they needed to fight him human, as the game actually forces you to turn human to start the fight.  

probably the one oversight in that battle, and the probably reason so many people did the "doornsipe" like you and /u/OuO_helloHave you played ALBW yet ?  
And if so what did you think of [StalBlind ? Personally I thought he was a great callback fight, without relying on soley nostalgia and actually making the fight even better](/spoiler)I'd like some more creatures like the bulbins.   
A group of (naturally) "neutral" monsters that aren't actually evil per say.  
Specifically I'd like some that can be "allied" (with through either a sidequest or during the main quest).  
i guess you could say, a bit like the Gerudo in OoT, but then with it having a much bigger effect on the world.  

Actual "inspiration wise though...  
Nothing specifically tbh.  
Maybe a Lamia-like enemy or something,  

,

My favorites... probably the Bokoblins in WW, although there are many enemies I like, for many different reasons.    
I also liked the Morth a lot, I wished it was possible to just carry one with you the whole game or something.True.Suu would probably be the day she formed her human form, and be made up by the household in order to make her feel homeFair enough.Yeah, same.  
Though the initial "shika shika shika" is a bit to fast for em to whistle right.Major stretch.  
There is nothing to really support this in any way.  
Placing amiibo onto a box, well, whatever floats your sunday I guess.?  Probably not, unless they really announce some amazing changes or something.  
Pokemon X and Y were the biggest dissapointment the series had thrown at me since... well probably, Emboar being a fire/fighting, which wasn't that long ago ...  
Actually, a lot of old games have reallly good FPS60FPS is not just a switch you flip though.  
It's not like those games "choose" to not be smooth and stable at 60 fps.  
It's give and take, and a lot of people would prefer what they decided to focus development on over 60 fps, which a lot of people really don't give a shit about.That can be said about anything.  
There will always be someone whose immersion is ruined for any reason you can come up with.  
Some people's immersion gets ruined by stuff like a reference to something else (like an assasin dead on top of a haystack and whatnot)  1 Frame per eternity.I don't think lala's birthdate is known yet.  
And I sorta expect her to be immortal and thousands of years old, probably not even having a "birthday" as she might be older than the calendar system, but who really knows.Those straps were made to contain hype, I'm sure they can handle a little kryptonian strength just fine.I think it is both the fact she is weak (physically) and has strong convictions.  
A lot of people like those types of characters being "stripped" of their mental fortitude.  Same reason as RivenXZac mate, people find it fitting for the characters,Like I said, nothing compared to Hype.That wouldn't work cause Ashe is against ultra violence, or even regular violence.  

Also, Ashe is physically not nearly as strong as Sejuani.  
Sejuani is also the strongest member of her tribe who rules by essentially beating anyone that doesn't listen to her to a pulp.  

Ashe is a diplomatic ruler that decided to marry a barbarian king to strengthen her otherwise lacking forces.  
Despite having the "biggest" territory, she needed all her alliences in order to match the other factions.  

Lissandra is an immortal ice witch who is essentially the entirty of her faction strength-wise.  
With only Trundle having joint her recently.  

If you really don't see why Ashe would be considered the weakest, then I don't know what to tell you.Also the people closest to the gods.  

Hylians are essentially "high elves" without the snobby attitude, infinte lifespan (still very long for some indiviuals though) and unlike the elves, they actually make (some) progress.  

So in a way, they are like half high elf, half human when comparing to basic fantasy 'rules'He was a futuristic one during alttp development&gt;My friends keep asking me why I like Nintendo so much and they keep insulting it and say I should get an Xbox.  

*your acquaintances, you mean.Codename S.T.E.A.M. is a great game though.  
Ok, and would it be considered normal to shit on someone for liking a Picasso just cause you are more of a Monet guy?Ashe is most definitly a lot weaker than Sej though.  
And it is part of her entire concept as a character.  
Ashe represents the "All for one" style of being strong.  
She is the character that creates strong bonds and wins by uniting unlikely allies.  
Sej. is the "everyone for themselves" type, with her strength coming from herself.
,believing that everyone that isn't strong, should not be allowed to live, or atleast not be on the same 'rank' as those that are.  

Just looking at their character designs, both personality/lore-wise aswell as visual designs should show you that more then enough.I don't need link caring for Zelda per say, just don't make her "there for the sake of being there" like in TP.  
WW darknut is technically also fightable without using the reaction skills.  Mostly I am afraid for the game after ZeldaU...  
If ZeldaU becomes very popular, that the series will only ever do big open world games for the 3D games anymore, as opposed to the more linear ones as well.  
Same for ALBW's effect on the item system and dungeon order concept.True, but at the same time, the cycle is very... iffy... atm.  
Who knows what the result might be...You could be.  
With the whole "Naming Link stuff"Maybe he "knew" he was based on Adam, but he probably had to "realize" that the commands he was fulfilling went against what his Adam-parts believed in.My link is an image, but the subreddit itself has the link on it.That was so for the first few games, but has since long changed.I hope so.It's based on a scene from [ricky and morty.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_LJtG2gXSc)WW and TP Link show way more emotion then an avatar "should" do.  
Hell, even MM and OoT (for the two he has) show way more emotion then an avatar should to be a good avatar,  

Only the first coupel games show no emotions/actions of their own.Nope, personally don't see it.  
You are exhanging your usage of a costume for a couple more hearts.  
Seems fair to me.  

Also, it, or the tingle thights in "don't fall in the pits" are way less "overpowered" as Goron garb is in the lava levels.  
You can essentially skip 50% of the entire area with the goron garb, it's insane.It should cause a drop down menu.  
Might not work on mobile, don't know.Araki doesn't even really use it as a full on name, but a nickname, none of the jojo are actually named jojo afterall.[Imgur Link](http://i.imgur.com/wg2KsE8.jpg)I was expecting danny to like the volcano eruption/mention it.Same with all disabilities tbh.  
It is usually easier to cope with never having it, then to lose it.Yeah way more.  
Not that strange considering the 3Ds has a WAAAAAY bigger instal base than the WiiUIn anime logic, you replace a buff man with a busty female while changing the gender.

And are you talking about the Convicts (the three guys riding around the centre park with their jeep with a minigun on )?  
Cause those guys had similar models, but not the same.  
Their skin color, (facial) hair styles and so forth were different.I mean that if there WAS gonna be one, they wouldn't admit too it.  
So them saying "nah" doesn't actually guarentee anything, they will always answer with a non-answer.I'm not saying it couldn't be "not for him"  
I only ever played the first one myself, and wasn't that amazed by it.  
but pinning bad graphics and "lazyness" on it, while the second is just straight up False and the first should be placed in context, is just stupid.  
Bantu, Oliver, Tharja.I would say Wii, if it wasn't for the gcb version of TP being better.  

So instead, I'm gonna go with the amazing luigi's mansion, and thus the gcb.  Especially levels where you need to totem, but are still treachorous.  
Falling during a totem is 3 hearts gone at once.His [scar is on the wrong side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSq31Z1nYq4)wow, people get butthurt over this.

The backstreet boys really weren't boys, nor from the actual backstreet.bit late for a pre-review isn't it.One series : Legend of Zelda

You played skyward sword wrong mate.  
Flick from the wrist, not from the arm and remember to reset whenever needed, and you can play from any positionThere were almost no games that needed it more though, that's the reason it was so small, cause it was a secondary option that wasn't really meant to be used as a primary.She trained until she became bald... and very strong.pretty decent list.  
but : 
&gt;Bullet Time? (WU)  

I don't see how this is somethhing that should come back every game.the ganondorf selfie will never not be hilarious, goofy, infuriating and amazing at the same time.If it ends up being a story-based power, I don't see how using it in all future games would make sense.Jep, only "issue" is that his partners will not be able to select the later stages yet and will have limited outfit slots (they can still select "I don't care/know" though, which will make their vote moot.)Except I never did, I answered his question based on the information available.Could work.  
Only issue is that if rupeeland would be canon, we have no idea where it fits in on the timeline.  
Personally I am a fan of the idea that Tingle is immortal (as long as he keeps gathering rupees) and that all Tingle's except the one from Termina are one and the same.Same, Only thing I wished for, is that they made it so the last two people you met stayed on your bottom screen after disconnecting, so you could still blacklist them.It's not weird, cause Goht is the best boss in MM (also the one in the original that didn't suck, unlike his 3 masked companions)Probably Molgera from Windwaker.  
It's really just walking around and hookshotting his tongue, but the music, setting and design of the boss are just awesome.Can't wait until he does the one with the pink octopuss that both causes the iceberg and saves everyoneThat assumes that Tingle's adventures take place in hyrule though.NpRupee regalia is so insane.  
You can earn like 400 out of just clearing the town...  

Annoying when teammates destroy all the bushes and pots before you can do it for more money thoughWell it sorta depends on area to area.  
But in general, it isn't a very celebreated holiday.  
It's mostly just some minor decorations and some more focus on spooky things in stores/on tv and whatnot.  
But trick or treating is very uncommon in my area personally.  

I'd say "three kings" (three wise men) holiday is much more popular in my country, and who knows about the other ones...eeh, depends.  
There is no presence of the triforce or anything else like it there. 

"deku" is a very common name in LoZ, and is essentially used for all the "plant" type creatures and their habitats.  
The great deku tree could be a bit more clear, but at the same time, we don't know how many there are, or even where they might have come from originally.   
The great maku tree also has 2 versions afterall.  Except I wasn't assuming anything out of SOMEONE.  
The "assuming makes an ass out of u and me" only really counts when you are "assuming" something of someone, not when you are using reasoning to determine the likeliest answer.Honestly, all the temple bosses in MM EXCEPT for Goht deserve hate.And that feeling when you topple him by doing that perfect jump over a pillar, dodgin the lightnign, right on his back.  
Honestly, the only thing that could have made that fight any better was a mounting sequence if you hit his back just right.Barinade is probably the other way around for me.  
I remember him worse (or to be exact, he (it?) is always the OoT boss I forget about the most) but his fight is pretty decent/fun.  It's a bit like the "rule of threes"  
It can get old if it is overdone, but in general, it is used a lot because it just works that great.You "mount" it and stab it in the eye-core.  
That fight could have been a fully automatic cutscene and it would still have been awesome.Honestly, that actually illustrates the one issue with goht...  
the way you start the fight.  
because you have thaw him out of the ice, a lot of people probably assumed they needed to fight him human, as the game actually forces you to turn human to start the fight.  

probably the one oversight in that battle, and the probably reason so many people did the "doornsipe" like you and /u/OuO_helloHave you played ALBW yet ?  
And if so what did you think of [StalBlind ? Personally I thought he was a great callback fight, without relying on soley nostalgia and actually making the fight even better](/spoiler)I'd like some more creatures like the bulbins.   
A group of (naturally) "neutral" monsters that aren't actually evil per say.  
Specifically I'd like some that can be "allied" (with through either a sidequest or during the main quest).  
i guess you could say, a bit like the Gerudo in OoT, but then with it having a much bigger effect on the world.  

Actual "inspiration wise though...  
Nothing specifically tbh.  
Maybe a Lamia-like enemy or something,  

,

My favorites... probably the Bokoblins in WW, although there are many enemies I like, for many different reasons.    
I also liked the Morth a lot, I wished it was possible to just carry one with you the whole game or something.True.Suu would probably be the day she formed her human form, and be made up by the household in order to make her feel homeFair enough.Yeah, same.  
Though the initial "shika shika shika" is a bit to fast for em to whistle right.Major stretch.  
There is nothing to really support this in any way.  
Placing amiibo onto a box, well, whatever floats your sunday I guess.?  Probably not, unless they really announce some amazing changes or something.  
Pokemon X and Y were the biggest dissapointment the series had thrown at me since... well probably, Emboar being a fire/fighting, which wasn't that long ago ...  
Actually, a lot of old games have reallly good FPS60FPS is not just a switch you flip though.  
It's not like those games "choose" to not be smooth and stable at 60 fps.  
It's give and take, and a lot of people would prefer what they decided to focus development on over 60 fps, which a lot of people really don't give a shit about.That can be said about anything.  
There will always be someone whose immersion is ruined for any reason you can come up with.  
Some people's immersion gets ruined by stuff like a reference to something else (like an assasin dead on top of a haystack and whatnot)  1 Frame per eternity.I don't think lala's birthdate is known yet.  
And I sorta expect her to be immortal and thousands of years old, probably not even having a "birthday" as she might be older than the calendar system, but who really knows.Those straps were made to contain hype, I'm sure they can handle a little kryptonian strength just fine.I think it is both the fact she is weak (physically) and has strong convictions.  
A lot of people like those types of characters being "stripped" of their mental fortitude.  Same reason as RivenXZac mate, people find it fitting for the characters,Like I said, nothing compared to Hype.That wouldn't work cause Ashe is against ultra violence, or even regular violence.  

Also, Ashe is physically not nearly as strong as Sejuani.  
Sejuani is also the strongest member of her tribe who rules by essentially beating anyone that doesn't listen to her to a pulp.  

Ashe is a diplomatic ruler that decided to marry a barbarian king to strengthen her otherwise lacking forces.  
Despite having the "biggest" territory, she needed all her alliences in order to match the other factions.  

Lissandra is an immortal ice witch who is essentially the entirty of her faction strength-wise.  
With only Trundle having joint her recently.  

If you really don't see why Ashe would be considered the weakest, then I don't know what to tell you.Also the people closest to the gods.  

Hylians are essentially "high elves" without the snobby attitude, infinte lifespan (still very long for some indiviuals though) and unlike the elves, they actually make (some) progress.  

So in a way, they are like half high elf, half human when comparing to basic fantasy 'rules'He was a futuristic one during alttp development&gt;My friends keep asking me why I like Nintendo so much and they keep insulting it and say I should get an Xbox.  

*your acquaintances, you mean.Codename S.T.E.A.M. is a great game though.  
Ok, and would it be considered normal to shit on someone for liking a Picasso just cause you are more of a Monet guy?Ashe is most definitly a lot weaker than Sej though.  
And it is part of her entire concept as a character.  
Ashe represents the "All for one" style of being strong.  
She is the character that creates strong bonds and wins by uniting unlikely allies.  
Sej. is the "everyone for themselves" type, with her strength coming from herself.
,believing that everyone that isn't strong, should not be allowed to live, or atleast not be on the same 'rank' as those that are.

Not to mention being hit by a stray big bomb with the full team, which takes away a whopping 6 hearts at once.  

No other zelda has damage like that.Imo, no.  
It is really great.  
I'm just sorta hoping we might see a FSA remake with this engine.  

Only the statue descends, and most humans are most likely to go to the surface and create the kingdom of hyrule after a while.  

It's not known if skyloft itself became the city in the sky after thouands of years of advancements in perfect peace, but it definitly seems likely that it, or a different "sky-islands" is what it was build on.&gt; 
&gt; Hyrule Warriors/Hyrule Warriors Legends:
&gt; Non-canon. But really could take place anywhere.

Actually, considering the games used in the WiiU one.  
The most logical timeline placement would have been after TP.  
This would mean all other "Era's"  they pull in where in the past/same timeline.  
Only issue is that Legends will also pull from WW.Tingle's Rosie rupeeland takes place before MC, and all the tingles we see throughout all of the hyrule's, are one and the same character.  
The only seperate one being Majora's Mask tingle, which is the Terminian coutnerpart.  

After the events of rupeeland, Tingle becomes immortal as long as he keep gathering rupees (later also finds out about similar materials)  
Then we see him in MC, just carefree with his brothers, more then enough money and stuff, and they are just fusing kinstones, hoping it brings them happyness and luck (mostly money)  

In the fallen timeline, we see that he traveled around, ending up in  Labrynna, showing off some genuine map making skill and minor magic powers(or he just swaps out your seed bag, who knows) 
And at the least his story or clothing design ends up in the knowledge of Madame in Hytopia.   

In the Child timeline, we don't see him (hyrulean tingle atleast) until the last game in the current line.  
With purlo in TP resembling him, possibly having based his outfit on having emt him, who knows.  
However, afterwards, Tingle seems to get a fasination towards force gems in FSA, which (to me) seems to imply force gems might also work for him to get life from.  
Considering how similar force gems (especially in FSA) are to rupees in many ways, this doesn't seem that strange imo.  

In the adult timeline, we meet Tingle who probably didn't have to easy a time to make new money with everyone scattered across islands like they are, however his map decyphering costs a hefty amount, which all goes into his health-bank.

The World of the Ocean King'sTingle is seemingly a wanted criminal (possible allusion to WW's Tingle being stuck in jail)  
And in ST he seems to have left a minor 'stain' with his statues and stuff.Sorta, it definitly feels like they were originally planning on placing it after TP (or atleast on that line) before aonuma just told them they would be part of a "alternate universe" (or whatever) version of the story.  

Either way, everything happens with giant timeline bubbles that follow barely any rules or anything, and considering they are now gonna pull from WW as well, it could be anywhere (Though I guess being before OoT, and pulling in stuff from the future would allow it access to all timelines if we think about it)True, but in that case you have multiple items available to you, a bigger maximum health bar (unless everyone in TFH takes the queen of heart costume, which comes at the cost of having any other costume powers) and you are better at taking them down on your own (TFH is even the first game with absolutely no shield available to you)it "was" as in : it was vaguely and offhandely mentioned in a MANUEL during the (s)nes eras, which had so much shit in their manuels, that frankly, this is probably the only fandom that really cares/clamps onto informations from one of those things.Jep, SS was the first game where could complete the game without ever getting a shield at any time in the game AFAIR, and TFH is now the first game to just straight up not give you a shield at all.  

I was sorta expecting a shield to be a possible outfit or something, but nope.Dan has... you know... his band, and touring with his band, and writing music, and filming music videos and so forth.  
On top of the gamegrumps stuff.  

All of them do gamegrumps and several side projects.We also don't need 15 posts telling other people to stop the "give dan a rest" posts.No hit run is what real hylains do.No, it was actually after another sealing of Ganondorf (so after FSA I guess??)  
In that sealing they sealed a part of him in multiple timezones, and the last one was watched over by the white witch, while she also watched over the timeline.  

That part then used the weakness in the white witch's soul (love for the hero) to corrupt her.
True.  
But I think FSA is the singular game that needs a "remake" the most.  
just cause of how hard it was to play originally.  
A new one would be amazing too though.  

I guess if they made a remake to get the engine, they could then make a new game afterwards.  

(PS: I would love a sort of combination of the "ideas" behind FSA and MM, with each player playing a different race with different abilities. and you need to work together that way.)Personally, I'm surprised they didn't make a "shield outfit" at the least.  
Or a shield item... (with holding it costing energy, and blocking with it costing a bit more, but leaving the enemy 'stunned' for a bit, then you could have a costume that upgrades the shield to the mirror shield. reflecting ranged attacks)They "came from the sky" in the way angels come from the sky.  
From an actually different world  
or atleast that seems the most likely considering what we see in MC.  This doesn't work for several games though.  

funny idea thoWell the first half is also already incorrect, in fact the very first point is already not True for Zelda I, AoL and TFHI doubt the 4th part was send back.  
Lanacia lived in the present for HW.Tri Force Heroes  
Phantom Hourglass is PHLet's be honest here, it is a small miracle they even found the two master ores and blue tunic in each temple they went too so far.And to think, if Arin hadn't spolied Irene being a sage for about 5~10 more minutes, Dan could have found out himself.  
Though I doubt he really would have said anything, considering the sages in ALBW have even less "getting to know them" then Nabooru and Impa in OoTYesI don't think Dan actually looked at the paintings during the Yuga scene.It really is.  
This level is really easy, Arin is just having insane tunnel vision again.&gt;Backwards compatibility, why? No one wants the Wii U now, how would adding that library to the NX help it reach a bigger audience?

That's the thing though, adding in backwards compatibility means you have a pretty big "launch line up" for people that skipped the NX.  
Many of them would still enjoy playing the WiiU games, they just don't want to buy the WiiU for it.  TBF, there has already been cosplay of several of the other ones&gt;Nintendo of Canada representative   

Says enough.  

Here is people that actually know what the fuck they are talking about their word on it.
(Mr. Shikata and Mr. Aonuma, whose names you should know quite well if you are a zelda fan)   
&gt;[In a recent interview with Gamespot, the game's director, Hiromasa Shikata said, you play as the exact same hero from A Link Between Worlds. Describing it as "a little unusual for a Zelda game, he said, "Initially, the story starts with the king recruiting hero candidates, and that's where Link steps in. There's a part of me that doesn't want people to come into the game thinking, 'Is he not a hero then? Is he just a candidate?' But I want to reassure people that this Link is the hero that came from the A Link Between Worlds world."](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/triforce-heroes-place-in-the-zelda-timeline-reveal/1100-6431687/)I'm with [Serb](/u/serbaayuu), just pick one and go.  
I will however tell you that you can not do the one at the bottom left of the map yet.  

You need an item for that one, that you will only get (available to you) from saving one of the other sages.  

If you really need a recomendation : A good one to start with is the one in the Loruel version of Kakriko Village, as it doesn't require an item, so it is a good way to get some more money to buy the items for the next dungeons and it won't matter if you end up dieing (which TBH is pretty unlikely.)Wii was something new too, and it still had backwards compatibility from the gamecube
  
Nintendo DS was made as a "third pillar" which would be kept alongside the GBA, not as a replacement of it, and yet it still had a GBA slot.  

Nintendo has had backwards compatibility on every (major) platform ever since past the N64-&gt;gamecube era (which obviously wouldn't have worked since they completely changed the input method)  

There is no guarentee there will be backwards compatibility, but there is even less guarentee 9or atleats, even less reason to think) there won't be.TBF, it's not like no-challenge level rewards are worth anything.  
He still finished the level and got rupees while he went to do whatever he had to do.  

And now my question to you is.  
You ASSUME he did this out of spite.  
but tell me, let us assume something bad happened at his place, like his sister fell down the stairs, or his dad got a heart attack or his dog just pulled something off of a table and it fell ontop of his skull, the dog now laying there, wheezing, bleeding and twitching its leg as the life slowly drains from his eyes. 

Would you have liked it more if he left the lobby, and you had to find new people and then do the entire level again.  
Or rather play with your "third mutant head" being dragged **BUT** still perfectly capable of finishing (as you did)  

You ASSUme he did it out of spite, but what if he did it to atleast give you a chance, as opposed to making your previous effort go to waste.Personally I would like the usage of Ant-body-building (which I have wanted since the first game, and Brawl made me want it even more with the (very minor) look into it with the pikmin chain) but I don't think it should be a seperate pikmin type.  I assume cheaters in an "IRL" setting would be rich boys that buy their armor from some other hunter and than prance about in gathering quests and in the tavern, but never actually go hunt anything and leave the quest as soon as a monster appears.Unless you have the body control of a sugar-injected ADHD-suffering chimpansee, Yes it is worth it.We don't know yet.  
But it seems likely.  
Do remember that HWL has the character swapping on the field, so most likely many missions will be rebalanced.  
I also wouldn't be surprised if they rebalanced the DLC content so that 100 was once again the highest level or something.  Gamers became lazy.   
That is all there is to it.  Only one shitting on your image in this thread atm is you yourself mate.  
Take a nice cold shower before you answer, cause it seems you are taking what is being said here different from how it is meant.Sadness :(  

Even more so since it was all filmed on to 3DS version (which is logical I guess, but still pretty sad considering WiiU looks so much better)   
The intro cutscene is absolutely amazing though.Ok, now compare the level of detail in the game world and the amount of stuff that have physics applied to them at all times to MGSV or any other game out at the moment.  

I love the way the fallout 4 dog smiles.  
Reminds me of my own dog.While I love the "leg fetish" joke, I have to wonder, in what way do Rachnee her legs count as legs if Cerea's and papi's legs didn't ??  
if we are being honest, only Lala has actual "legs" (and smith offcourse) and suu is the closest thing out of the marriage optionsThat's the thing though.  
You'd never be able to go beyond "hotdog down a hallway" with her...  If anything, she is beyond the concepts of life and death.  
Her downsides could also be the atraction to death, no presence, not interested in you while you are alive/having a normal life, and the head thing still.I liked the "you sick fuck" joke way more then I should have.Every time a new console came out, the first thing you see pop up on forums is : "I skipped the previous generaton, what are some good games I should play"  
 
It's not cause you skipped a generation, that that means you have absolutely no interest in any games from said generation, that's retarded reasoning.  

Backwards compatibility is a big deal, and something people love to see.  
Hell, xbox just now has a bullshit variation on it, and people were gushing over how great it was last E3.  

Cutscenes triggering to show a door opening make it pretty obvious where you need to go too.  
But... you know... *grumps*First of all, i don't care about backwards compatibility.  

but either way, your reasoning is flawed from the get go.  
Consoles cost money.  
Lots of people don't just have money to spend willy nilly at every point in their life.  
they might have skipped a generation cause of other reasons then just "I didn't care about it"  

or otherwise, they might have skipped it cause they didn't have time when it came out, liek your backpacking example, or they might have skipped it cause they didn't think the console was worth it, despite having a couple games they were interested in either way.  

You also act like this is some perfect guaranteed-to-happen logic, yet ignore the fact that Nintendo has done backwards comp. for all platforms they could ever since gba.  
Even though the gcb was also far from a success, the wii still had backwards compatibility.  
And one of the major dissapointments for many consumers at the end of the wii's lifecycle, was that the newer wiis of the time did not have that option.  

It seems pretty clear from your responses that you are a tunnel-man though, so I doubt that you'd even consider these options.  
You assume the entire world and consumer market has the same tastes, reasoning and situation as you.Exactly.  
That's the point.  No quite the opposite.  
People keep comparing the game with these other games with "better graphics" ignoring how easily that line of reasoning can be swapped around by looking at a different aspect.  &gt; Lots of people don't just have money to spend willy nilly at every point in their life.
&gt; These people are not the target audience. Maybe Sony and Ms should stop selling consoles because people don't have money. There is one thing you fail to understand in all of this and that's mass market appeal. This excludes the core fanboys who think Nintendo can do no wrong and the people that don't really care about gaming.
&gt; they might have skipped a generation cause of other reasons then just "I didn't care about it"
&gt; I already stated that Nintendo isn't here to have your back just because you were poor at the time or took a trip to the moon. The idea that these companies would even care about these fringe gamers is laughable. #fringegamersdontmatter

Then explain why they did for every other system.  
you can keep comparing to those other systems, but you are beyond "acting stupid" and into the realm of legit blind reasoning or retardation if you think Xbox and PS were choosen because of not having backwards comp.  

Nintendo has never needed to use backwards compatibility to sell their consoles, yet they have done so time and time again.  
You can keep pointing at the others all you want, I am basing it on previous events from the actual subject of the conversationIt is an 'original' design (like many of the HW weapons tier 2/3) but seems heavily inspired by [The boxart sword from Adventure of Link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Zelda_II_The_Adventure_of_Link_box.jpg)  Implying you'll ever be looking at the characters talking to you, instead of messing up their entire house while they jab about your quest.Yes yes, har har. 
Except her "legs" look the least like actual legs out of everyone that doesn't have a tail isntead.Lol, you are being pathetic over reddit points ?I'm already impressed he didn't skip the blue tunic.Ok, so they spawned the maimais  
Now they just need to get the net (preferably some more bottles), pegasus boots and go to the blacksmith(s)  
And if they get really lucky they will find a goldenbee, though even if they do, I doubt they would bring it to the bee-guyEveyr couple of years, everything in your body is swapped out completely (obviously not at once)  
So what's really the difference?She is a birb !Mewtwo isn't a villain eitherThere are more than 3 people on gamegrumps  
right now, there are 6 that (well, he is the sixth) that make common appearances, then there is Kevin the editor.  

(not to mention Holly and Graham, whose status is contested)Only bad thing I have seen so far is the very lackluster "character" selection (your starters)  

It is nothing but starters and riolu.  
Red/Blue/sky/darkness/time had really fun alternate options like phanby, skitty, meowth, cubone, machop etc...  

A very minor downside to otherwise nothing but good news so far though.If it is anything like the previous games, you are stuck with your main pokemon during the story, but afterwards you can swap all you want.&gt;Edit: Seriously, why do I always get downvoted for hating the concept of release dates? When something is done, LET ME FUCKING PLAY IT  

Cause you come over as an annoying brat with major entitlement issues and cry over downvotes.She appeared and talked to him in the afterlife and teleported to the Onsen when he was near-death.  
Not to mention she says that after Kimitho's death, she will take care of his soul afterwards, implying she at the very least would be capable of living for a LONG time after a human's lifespan in some form.  

&gt;
That's practically the same for tsundere/kuudere characters; there's always going to be a wall that needs to be climbed before they show any interest. Also, I don't find not having any presence as a downside at all. That would just mean you can hog her all to yourself.  

There are almost no downsides for any of the girls that you can mention then.tell me, do you even hear/read the things you say/type ?  

Releasing something on the release date is "hating your consumers" now ?  
Subpar services are comparable to fulfilling the concept of a fucking release date now?   

Get over yourself.Yeah, sure.  How do you even know he found out through here ?Nah, she never had one, and her Sabre is based on her Knife from WW, but it was never that size in Windwaker.He really isn't.  
Mewtwo in the games is nothing but a pokemon that escaped imprisonment and is now living away from humans until we capture it.  

In the anime world, the one from the first movie was "the villain" for that movie, but turns good at the end, and is a good guy in his second appearance, and there has since been a different mewtwo (somehow) that was also good.  

There are only 3 actual straight-up villains in the entire smash bros series (as playable, not counting the koopalings/recolors for obvious reasons)  
And that is Ganondorf, Bowser and Bowser Jr.  

All other characters are anti-heros, rivals or were bad at some point and have long since changed into a different role.  Clearly you do care more then "meh" about it, since you felt the need to call it out.  

And it could still easily be he saw it himself beforehand, but only thought to re-post it later.  
Petey &gt; Dry bones &gt; (King) Boo.She's from Mario Galaxy .Depends, it could be that the mirror has rules or limitations.  
I strongly doubt the mirror would have been able to supply a whole army on its own tbh.  

Also, the idea of the mirror seems to be that it creates a dark copy, so it could be only good things can be copied/converted.  
Otherwise, Medusa could have just copied herself lots of timesbefore Pit even arrived.  Physical copy, store-advantages, potential for the store breaking release date, allowing you to play sooner, etc...[Explaned in a nice song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUVI5ukXcRI)&gt;The man in the images starts the conversation saying that he is fascinated by the Oocca. He then goes on to say, in the first image, that there was some race that created the Hylians. The second image is the most important. He mentions that this race created the Hylians and built a city in the sky simultaneously, and then goes on to say that they dwelt there and still live there to this day.  

Remember : Legends told in-game are not guarenteed to be correct, as they are LEGENDS and retellings.  

The Hylains were not created by the Oocca, if anything, they were "Hylia's people" 
**HOWEVER** something that could easily be (especially after MANY years) is that the legend got twisted.  
And what is really the case, is that the Oocca are what became off  the people that stayed in the sky after SS.  
They would then be "what created the hylians" on the land, namely : the people that split off and went back to the surface once came from the same place (skyloft) as the people that even now, live in the sky.  

Don't forget, that all human civilization was essentially destroyed during the thousands of years before SS.  
Add to that all the hundreds upon hundreds off years until we reach TP, and the chance the signs to the "sky people" as well as the traditions were still in place after all that time is small.  
Much more liekly, would be that when the Hylian kingdom was formed after SS, the people that stayed in the sky would create an alliance to their brethren on the ground, with the sky messenger and the other rituals being created at that point.   

Just want to point out, that even in shads little story, he says "And **SOME** say those are the creatures that 'made' the hylians"  
So already we have a clear example of the legend being very unclear.  
Also, note that the people in SS are all hylians, and were all very "close to the gods" as they were all the descendants of the people hylia herself send into the sky.  

  

Well the issue with that is that barry was considered the "secret third grump" back when it was Jon and Arin, even though he was never in any episodes. &gt; Legends are a big part of the Zelda series and I'm having trouble coming up with legends throughout the series that turned out to be False.  

Windwaker opening legend has several flaws in it.  

And your examples of legends being passed down are very laughable (the examples are, not you)    
Both in SS and in WW, people had all but forgotten about there ever being a different "state" of humanity.  
In WW, everyone had forgotten the legend of the sunken land, with even the tradition that spawned from it only being practices on a single (or at most handfull of) islands.  
In SS, people assume there is nothing below the clouds, and Groose actually flips his god damn shit at the very notion of there being "small birds"  

Also, all that shad's reserch proves is that the sky people existed (big surpirse considering we carried 2 of them through like 3 dungeons before even meeting shad)   
Nothing of what he reveals shows any indication of them actually having "created" Hylians, nor of the timing of their civilization.  
And the "they created us" thing is even something Shad  himself says is a thing "SOME" belief/say.   

Also, "created" can mean a lot of things, it can mean actually "bringing them into existance" *poof*, but it can also just as easily mean the "creation" of a group/a concept.  
If I start a religion, then I "created" the concept of being "[Name for believers of my religion]" at that time and moment.  
Or if I start a royal guard called the "Iron brigade", then I "created" the "iron brigade"  

And if we take created to mean "they started the concept of people that live in name/service of the Goddess Hylia" 
Then that can even more easily refer to whoever decided to stay on the surface with Zelda after SS.  

Also, if you want to take all legends in the series as fact.  
Then : Farore is said to have "produced" ALL lifeforms, so that already means we have an battle over who gets to keep the kids.He is a bounty hunter, in both command and assault, he not only helps Star Fox out, but saves [fox's live](https://youtu.be/uB_nbSswAD0?t=1m55s) and almost [sacrificed his own and that of his team}(https://youtu.be/FVaIMK-Xbrc?t=7m39s) (they survived)  

In command, there is even an ending in which it is Wolf and his team that save the day in the end.  Probably his job too, wasn't he hired by the president ?  
Hero  

Cause he stopped someone from obtaining something he would do bad things with.I won't.  
I spend like 10 minutes on most of my characters, and most of that is spend reading what everything gives me (in a game where you choose stats/skills/race/etc...)  

I'll never look at my character anyway.It really isn't...

Also, it is called : "Pikmin"Anything is "still better" than what Gates had.  
It is inferior than the other ones imo though.It is part of the reason as to why I think Medusa or Hades would have been way better as second KI rep than Palutena is.Still not True tho.  
Just as an easy example : Wonderful 101  
it was made by Platinum, but Nintendo owns the rights.  

Not to mention if we look at what Nintendo's other companies have made since.  
Stuff like codename S.T.E.A.M., Pushmo, Dillon's rolling western, etc...  

I think the idea was more that he makes up 1/3th of Starbomb, so in a situation in which all of them take an equal amount of work, he needs to do 1/3th  
however, no matter how many professors or physicists, etc... there are, you are still doing the full brunt of it for your own work  
The stand is actually the least of the issue.  
(I mean, Josuke's stand is called "crazy diamond yet he is perfectly sane unless someone says something about his ridiculous hair)  
It is more the fact that he straight out admits that he will use the stand to essentially become a tyrant.  
he might swing the meaning around with his napkin explanation, but he still clearly intends to use it for his own gain, and to bring suffering onto others.Except it wouldn't make sense for the concept they were going for. . .  
The Idea was that ever since Danny became Not-so-grump, Brain has been in the room showing them flash cards.  
It also plays off of a joke they go mention now and then, where they say brain is always in the room, but that joke was only ever started since Dan joined.  

Also, it would have required them to film live action parts with Jon, which , again, wouldn't work, cause Jon is busy on the other side of the country  
And, their recording location has changed drastically since.Dark Pit was just an alt. costume that got promoted.  
He costed almost no development resources and unlike Lucina, it makes sense for him to be a clone, so I don't really mind him that much, although I wouldn't have minded if he just stayed an alt. costume with some alternate lines.  

Palutena on the other hand was just a bad choice imo, and especially so considering how she ended up, and that they *wasted* the "custom moves are different" thing on her.  Pokemon is to big.  
Yokai Watch COULD become a 'threat' if it ends up able to keep up the pace withoutscrewing something up along the way.  

That said, Pokemon is still the king.  
yeah sure, Yokai beat out ORAS, but don't forget ORAS was a remake, and that pokemon has those amazing sales numbers as a nearly annual release.  This isn't the first time someone did pokemon ebtter than GF though.  
I mean, has GF even done pokemon good ever since gen II~III anyway.  

I doubt it will do anything unless Yokai actually stays good for a baker's dozenI actually meant Pandora, but the same point remains.  
If the mirror could just copy anything whenver, then why wasn't there some enemy  or line of enemies in front of it, continually being cloned.&gt;They need Arin on the control and Dan on the side. Dan's going to love it because it's a darker zelda it's story and graphics are really pretty I can already see him getting into it.  

Implying they will put any amount of effort into following the story

I mean, they are free to not do so if they wish, but you know they will barely pay attention to anything.  

I think playing Four Sword Adventures or Tri Force Heroes on grumpcade would be more interesting.  
Also, considering the (likely) rumors for a potential Twilight Princes HD remake, it would be wiser for them to just wait for that version.  Oh god, more kevin flaming incoming ...Personally, I think the Mirror doesn't make an "evil copy", but more like, a "reversed copy"  
So if Hades were to copy his own army, the monsters and generals would be compasionate towards humans and be on the side of light.  

So the only way to get something out of it is by copying good guys.  

I also wouldn't be to surprised if it is 1 copy per being.  

Or maybe even, that only a single copy can exist at the same time.  

.

My last 'theory' would be that the destruction of the mirror before Dark Pit was complete also caused something else to "malfunction".  
I think potentially, the damage inflicted on either one might have had adverse effects on the others, but because Dark pit was an interupted copy, he gets the same shit as Pit gets, but not vice versa.  

If that were the case, then a completed copy would have been even more dangerous, as it would have meant Pit couldn't take it down without hurting himself.Except nobody would have know so if you didn't complain.  You don't.  
You accept that some people like to enjoy a game differently.PS: I removed this postI removed this as it is a repost.Play random.More like, he is an airbender that has released his earthly thether if he can "swim" through the air.Last REAL zelda newcomer was in Melee.  
Toon Link was just a renamed Young Link.. . .It is an immortal god of death.  
I don't think he relies on pure luck to come back. 
The grimleal survived a thousand years "somehow", most likely, he can affect people even when dead, to prepare for his return.  
&gt; There was a discussion earlier this month (Fates spoilers in link) about other ways to frame the choice between "your adopted family" versus "your blood family", and the main alternate that was brought up was to reframe the conflict as "the life you've always known" versus "the nation that is morally right". /u/wyrdwoodwitch mentioned that, while certain aspects of the Nohr story are not good, Nohr is the side "being an objectively bad nation doing objectively bad things," and had this contrast of "the bad side, but populated by people the protagonist cares about" against the "good side that doesn't deserve to be attacked" been played up more, the overall conflict would be more interesting to play through. I don't know too many story details, but the consequences of choosing one side or the other should be hard-hitting, in theory. In this sense, I agree with BrightBow's position.

Only issue with that, is that the only way to make that choice mean anything to the player, is to give them MUCH more time in the Nohr route beforehand, preferably before even knowing you were adopted.  &gt;
Firstly, Grima, like Naga, is not actually a god. Secondly, the Robin ending of Awakening contradicts any immortality he might lay claim to. Finally, at the height of pedantry, Grima is more closely associated with destruction than death.  

Immortality doesn't allways mean you can't be killed.  
You also have "age-immortality"  
And even then, he could only be killed because Robin was "part" of him.  

&gt;Obviously, he relies on his vassals and hierophants in the real world to prepare the stage for his reawakening. Problem is, that there's several things that could be done to prevent his return including, but not limited to:
Preventing the Grimleal from performing the effective eugenics program they need to spawn a suitable vessel for Grima
If a vessel is born anyway, killing them
Destroy the Dragon's Table and any and all associated artifacts so Grima has nowhere to reformulate himself
Depopulating Plegia so that Grima has nobody to feed on if he somehow manages to reawaken despite all of this, leaving him in a weakened state so he can be taken down  

Except you assume all of these are a constant.  
Who is to say the "dragon's table" can't be created again, and merely needs a spot with some sort of dark energy.  
Who is to say only plegia has a chance to become the grimleal's place of operations, or even that the grimleal CAN be stopped.  

You just assume that the one situation we see, is the only possible result.&gt;If we're moving this deep into abstract postulation then we're so far detached from the reality of the situation that it becomes meaningless. My original point was that Grima's return wasn't as imminent as it was made out to be because of the sheer number of things that had to be present for his return.  

plegia didn't even exist 1000 years ago, or atleast not non-stop, conssidering the Marth games take place in the same area, yet has different countries.  
So clearly he already came back despite one of the "chainlinks" not being there.  

Also, 1000 years is a long as time, especially in a medieval fantasy setting.  
no way in hell would people still be watching out for the signs of Grima's return after 1000 years. 
So yeah, Must have missunderstood the chronology then.  
&gt;
legends throughout the series that turned out to be False  

Already pointed out the warping and forgetting of legends shown in WW and SS 

&gt;  
proof of your claim that the Oocca are what remain of the residents of Skyloft  

Never said that, said it was an option.  

&gt;
proof that the Oocca didn't create the Hylians , or that Shad's legend is False  

show me proof it isn't.  

The very existance and legend of it itself was also forgotten, only the traditions remained.  
And one of the legends that got twisted is the legend of the hero of time, whom people belief would come and save them, as they thought he was a timetraveler.  

You and me both know OoT Link was never gonna go save those peopleWow, 2 stars.  In what way is MM the black sheep . . . ?  We already saw what would happen if he did thanks to lorule though.  
it isn't a smart idea.  

Also, the adult/flooded timeline already continues on without the triforce atm.  

And Demise's curse didn't mention the triforce. 
Ganon(dorf) just goes after it because it is the best way of gaining power.  

Lastly : "will lead to sequels"  
No zelda game actively does this, except maybe WW.  And it isn't like there aren't alternative ways to gain immense power.We have had several games without "get the triforce" already though, it doesn't need to be destroyed for that to happen.Sail around and go to a different island or change day/night till you get the right moon cycleNo, but only cause I never 'started' waiting for it.  
I have no hype for the game, and very little interest.  
I was hoping that, when more news came up about it, I would hear some things that made me interested, but alas.  Stands don't have actual names though, the owner can name it however they like Only problem with that is that you don't know someone's first zelda from age alone.  
Friend of mine is 23 and only started playing the games last year.wait, top 10 ?  
The question asks me what my top three is, not ten...He must have gotten them when Alf came back... in POG form !T F H is canon, and scores pretty high for me already.FSA is the worst selling title, and is very hard to get to play 'right' sadly.   
Personally I am hoping for a "remake" on either the 3DS (they could use the TFH engine) or even better, the WiiU.If they do, I hope they don't  take example of Splatoon to much, lest the singleplayer experiences will suffer greatly.Well he probably would, considering how much merch he has.I wouldn't expect anyone to join the household.  
ESPECIALLY NOT Oct.  
Don't forget she lived in that cave, and specifically wanted to be left alone.  

Why would she suddenly sign up for the exchange program and go live in a busy house in that case ?  

Personalyl, I think it is pretty clear that the 7 we have now, is what we are gonna stay with.  
With 6 of them as marriage options, and Lala being there for lala reasonsIf your main complaint is that OoT's world didn't feel "alive" enough/felt dul, then MM is a good choice.  
They essentially made the exact opposite game from OoT.  

Instead of having like 9 dungeons, there are only 4, but instead, a lot of focus is on the sidequests and the characters/world.I doubt it.  
And I especially doubt that only ballot characters remain if that is the case.  
Maybe they waited to make the ballot character till it was over, but in that case I'm sure they made some different characters/content since.Anniversary gives you 2 links to swap around in solo IIRC.  

That said, Many people would skip the game if they felt they can't get the "real" experience easily.  
It's a sad fact, but it is what happened.  
A re-release with 3DS connectivity or even better : Online, would probably do it good,Wii Fit Trainer  
Goddess.That iron man flight doesn't make sense, Iron man keeps his hands behind him when he flies as they are part of his propulsion.Which is pretty impressive, considering there are 8If Pokemon ever gets a set, I think only the starters will get actual figures, maybe a couple of legendaries.  
The rest would have to be cards.  

But if they put on some of the better artwork designers from the TCG, atleast the cards will look amazing.I feel like everyone complaining about ross not getting the story/not having paid attention must be new to Gamegrumps.  

Newsflash : Gamegrumps wouldn't even be able to get the lore/story right for pacman, let alone a game like this.Still, that doesn't need to happen just to have a game not centered around it.  

MM, PH, ST, OoX, LA, MC, FS, FSA and TFH are all already without the triforce as some important plotpoint.  I agree, but specifically I'd like more lala that isn't one of the same 5 or so pictures.. . .And jus tlike digimon, and many of the other likewise cases.  
it will do many good things pokemon doesn't, yet be ultimately brushed off as merely a "pokemon wannabe" by many peoplePersonally I'd advise it.Rupee reg. is insane.  
At first I was like "ow so it causes double drops, that's cool", Little did I know it also makes dubble purples drops an option while breaking generic stuff.  

Just runs through town can easily net you 300+ each time.Nope, I do not consider eevee an eeveelution.Definitly.  
Major waste of potential.Thus we have :  
Flareon  
Jolteon  
Vaporeon  

Umbreon  
Espeon  

Leafeon  
Glaceon  

SylveonBruh, they haven't even gotten the pegasus boots, extra bottles, or the net.  Nope, the fire rod is usefull here (and everywhere tbh, cause that shit is OP as all heck, especially the *nice* Fire Rod), but not at all needed.  
It is only needed in the ice dungeon.  IIRC, you need to kill them to get the hylian shield, not to proceed.Guessing they will miss the Hylian shield, which isn't really a big deal, considering Dan never uses the shield, and the only advantage of Hylian over regular is that it can block magic attacks.  

They got 2 ores and the blue tunic anyway.  
So they are pretty much set.  

Strongly doubt they will find the other 2 ores, and expect them to pass the red tunic.definatly.Pretty funny that the character that is essentially from the most "simple" game has these crazy. almost rube goldberg level, setups.I doubt winnarly "mains" greninja, considering he doesn't really care for SM4SH that much.  
I think he just likes tonguescarf mcfrogninja..Sometimes, a fan that is dedicated to expressing and sharing their love, is so good at expressing their love, that they get hired to do so.I'm way to tired to handle this title...  

Also, they would all be Gingers, cause Gingers rule.None other than Oliver, Champion of Beauty !!!Well there is the one in the hallway to the downfloor that's True.  

IIRC, the ones in the main lower chamber need to eb killed to get the hylian shield.  
Could be one of the side rooms need it though.   
Wonder if they will reach the piece of heartWhich are all from pretty simple games if you think about it...  
Pretty funny.We all know it won't get voice chat, especially not with random match ups.Thief guy in the village that keeps running away from you, he uses them to dash around.  They already got 2 ores and the blue tunic, which are all optional.Well it might be his main on SM4SH, but AFAIK, he isn't that big on SM4SH.Simple, at the end they will find a way to copy Kurusu, so EVERYONE gets chosen.  
(and then we pretty much get the "8 brothers" series.)The clouds are a magical barrier more than anything.  
They probably are just made to keep stuff in/out but have no effect on the sunlight.  Cheating is subjective.Who knows what their technology is capable off.  
maybe ti works like a little hollogram projector with the data on,which gets scanned/downloaded when walking over it.  Next E3&gt; But of course, not every game is perfect...  

More like, no game is perfect.doubtfull if you ask me.Lloyd doesn't say the name of the tree at the end.close is not a cigar.  
I also have never played starcraft and thus have no way of pointing anything out about it.  
But I'm sure you can find some thing they could have done better, even if it was just a more clear explanation of something, a shortcut for some action, or so forth.  No point in getting hype over something we don't know anything about if you ask me.  
I look forward to getting information on it, and i am already guarenteed to get one, but hype just seems to soon.I hold that against the game, even afte all these years.Don't be sad for what is over, be glad that it happened.  Favorite Sword : Four Sword (Legendary sword that turns you into a 4-man team) or Master Sword (SS), if I can count Fi as part of it.  

Favorite Shield : Mirror Shield (MM), the face on it is funny or Ordon shield, cause of how it is unique and if you lose it, you will never get it back. (forever cursed to have either the generic wooden shield, or nothing in that shield slot on your save file)  

Favorite Item : Grabbling Hook (WW and PH), cool to swing with, interesting boat-use and superfun to steal shit with.  And in PH I loved the interesting and original uses for it, like using it as a catapult for yourself or creating tightropes.  

Bonus round :  
Items that should be brought back some time : Seeds and seed shooter, magnet glove, switchhook, (oracles games were so good at coming up with fun new stuff) and roc's feather.  

Favorite Link Family Member : Grandma  

Blind runs like these always remind me of the legend himself [genuinescorruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPiV5Sq8CmI) (good old youtube quality of 6 years ago)Windwaker, Windwaker and windwaker HD, to get a windwaker with more windwaker content, with the HD graphics.Never played a fallout before, but ussually I'm a kleptomaniac good guy/sellsword.[Hey ya, is pretty cute imo](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/jjba/images/5/59/HeyYacolor.png/revision/latest?cb=20141022025642)Exept that in the other one, nobody dies.  
I'm serious, not even the captain ends up dying.nope, I don't play with lego anymore, so I wouldn't really buy it just to gather dust.  Not with that attitude.It also completely destroyed the balance for many of the dungeons/the story in general.  
By the time I saved the second sage, I pretty much owned every item and had over half of them powered up, essentially meaning not a single dungeon had something difficult in it anymore.  

I'm not one of the people that wants zelda to be difficult (seems to me like asking something to be something it hasn't been for decades now) but ALBW was very lacking in that aspect.  
I think you reacted in the wrong chain, we weren't talking about cybernetics here.Nope, if anything, the 3D ones so far have been very dissapointing imo.about 4 days for me.Same for me.  
Belgians represent !!Wow, major downvoting on a comment that is going along with Op's joke.  Probably so it can last him a while I'd guess.  
Looks like he is going for all amiibo.Other M /s   

For real tho, Samus isn't among them, the samus picture is just the banner pic.Nah, day after it.  
Palais 12 in Brussels  

You have fun though.Same, originally I didn't see the Brussels planning on the list (I stopped watching halfway cause it looked like the tour went back to America and didn't expect them to come back afterwards again) and then I was planning to go to one of the ones in either Germany or France.  

But being able to just go in brussels is way easier.Be preparred to do it like another dozen or so times if you want to get everyone maxed out.  
At the end, the full rupee glitch is still nothing compared to the insane amount of rupees that leveling to 255 takes.Not to mention that the barrier itself might not stretch out that insanely far.You can't use download play at the same time as online.  
(this isn't just a rule for TFH, but for the 3DS in general)You mean specifically that link look ?  
Doubt it, only reason they brought it back is to really hammer in the "Alttp2" feel (which is even its name in japan, well, triforce of the gods 2 that is)  

and in general, remakes of the 2D games are sadly enough not high on their priority list it seems.  
Kinda stupid, considering the oracles, AoL, Zelda I and so forht could use a remake way more than WW or TP did.Whatever Helps the metroid fanbase to sleep at night.  

I mean, after not being able to enjoy a game decently since super until something worse (In their opinion) comes out, constantly thinking Ridley had a shot at smash and needing to make a scene whenever Samus is shown to have tits, I can understand them needing to go into denial.Except it sorta does.  
That is the entire reason perfection doesn't "exist".  
Cause for something to be perfect, it needs to be without flaw for every single person.you have cheated us, and we didn't even realize.I liked it.  
Quite a lot.  
I think it could have used some changes in feel here and there.  
The PTSD scene was a good concept imo, but was overdone.  
etc...  
Not like the shield is really that usefull in ALBW anyway.  
You are almost always better of dodging than blocking.If you play this dungeon without the blue tunic and on hero mode, those red wizzrobes are practically instakills, pretty insane.  


they got pretty lucky with killing that one wizzrobe, otherwise they wouldn't have found the hylian shield (not like it matters, cause the hylian shield is barely usefull in this game)While I like the added lore hints it adds, I do think it is a big shame we didn't get a "Lolian shield" in this game.That's not how Lorule works...  Fusion.Jon did.god... he's just playing with that guy/corpse...  
That's brutal.  

I was expecting the sort of thing like when a horse or cow goes crazy in a crowd but, you know, upscaled.  
Didn't expect it to be so contained, yet somehow, even more fucked up.That can be said about anywhere (or nowhere depending on your view of "death" and whether it is ever 'deserved') 
No way of knowing any of those people were assholes though.  

Cause we kept them locked up for so long.  
No animals evolved to be domesticated without our influence.Except it can totally happen ["overnight"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musth)I think he was trying to do a "switcharoo" by implying the dude, not the elephant.No, that reason is cause I just have google as my homepage and never bother changing it.Most of the main ones, yes.  
Though I never stuck for the mother/earthbound subreddit, that one left a bad taste in my mouth.  

.

I don't think any of the characters say anything in an actual langauge though.  
But they still need to translate the new lines for those characters.  

If they wanted too, they totally could do a simultanous release, but they probably won't cause they don't consider it to be worth to aim for.

Notice how nothing on this list is from OoT?  
There is a reason for that. Dunno, probably the same guy that made these pictures ?  
I've seen that picture show up on /r/metroid a couple times, but I have no idea for the rest.Nintendo wouldn'tNah, you wouldn't have seen me there, I have zero interest in that series.  
And its fans are too dedicated to really go on there if you aren't.Damn that was a great read.I like it, I just consider it overrated, and to be essentially like a prototype of the rest of the 3D games.  
Overshadowed in pretty much everything by his younger brothers.  

I do have to say that favorite Kokiri would have to go to that girl that is part of the trading quest.  
but you know... there are no kokiri in any other game... so..... (well except for Fado in WW, but... you know)  

&gt;or have you just not played it.  

I played them all.It was a joke.I'm being dead seriousReally ?  
Controls felt very tight if you asked me.I had that every time Nintendo ended up doing a "get a free game" deal the last 3 years.  
Already have all the ones I want to play by then.  

Usually they make for pretty good gifts.Real thing you need mental prep for is "don't pop any balloons" in Hinox Mines.  Well, the name implies a connection to force gems if anything, but it is indeed pretty funny.  
Guess that space inbetween tri and force wasn't just for showMeh depends, while they are instakills, their attacks are also superslow.  
I played through the entire hero mode without gameovers, without going for it.And he did so before Jacksfilms.This is hilariousIf DLC counts : Baby park  
It doesn't work without the specials from DD,  
(it looks great though)She's a birb !!That has nothing to do with Fi.People love the circlejerk over the companions.  
Same deal as with Navi.  

People just love to complain about everything they can until the cycle shifts, and in a dozen years, people will be gushing from the mouth about how amazing SS was, and how no other zelda game ever came close to it since.My biggest complaints about SS are all the circlejerks and overreactions people make up over it.I still think it will be the end to world hunger, usher in world peace and make slushies.  
Still no voice chat though.Also, it's valve...Winter isn't THAT far away anymore.You can't use two wiiU gamepads, at the same time with the same WiiU, Period.Shame R&amp;M isn't popular in japan.  Real shame the battle system is the way it is, would have loved the discover the world otherwise.It has been that way for every 3D zelda.  
It's called the zelda cycle for a reason, it cycles through.  

though the remakes have made the cycle a bit iffy atm.Which is still only about a month and a half away from now.  
And the other ones are more generic "winter" decorations, and you wouldn't update your stock multiple times just cause it might be like a week to soon for one part of it.You clearly have no understanding of what the zelda cycle is.  "only two" out of the two possible ones to have compelte their cycles.    
OoT was the origin of the cycle, it didn't have something to compare it too, but has since been involved in the cycle since its god status was finally revoked after MM took it over, and is now starting to lose it.  

TP was loved at release, then *everyone* hated it for being dark and gritty, now suddenly *everyone* wants a remake for it cause *they* think it is the best one.  
Even SS has already went through the first phase of the cycle.  

And 100 dollar in ten years ?  
That is like betting with a god damn spoiled candy bar.  
I don't even get up in the morning for less than 250.  
In 10 years I'll probably not even be here anymore.  

And again, you clearly have no understanding of what the cycle is actually about.  
but hey, keep raging over something you don't even understand, makes you look real good.Wario in plumber costume is likely ina  different line.  
But the rest, doubtfull.  
The koopakids might get some in other lines too, considering they seem to have become a staple of the series once more.  
And Alph might get lucky with Pikmin 4  

But in the smashbros line, i doubt any of them will get one(That's not a correct example of the cycle tbh, but whatever, it works decently enough for someone that is just gonna stick his finger in his ears and pretend to know what he is saying)  

Except that TP's previous vocal state was exactly that, people hated how it tried to be dark and gritty, and was nothing more but OoT+  

And MM is just coming off of its "it is perfect in every way" horse just now, while WW was starting to get on there.  
Only issue atm is that the remakes threw the cycle of balance, and it hasn't really gotten the time to stablize yet.  

But again, you have no understanding of the cycle, seeing as you think it involves individual opinions and such.Jep I have.  
Really disliked the battle system.  
One fo the few games I never finished.I mean, I wasn't really expecting anything since I know how Xenoblade C. was.  
I just would have loved to explore the world, if the battle system wasn't so... well... "so"  

I like being able to just walk around a world, but the XC battle system was very annoyign and not at all fun for me, so Sadly I'll sit this one out.Oooh you scamp you.Tell me, how long have you been following zelda.  

You can't "explain" the cycle.  
You experience it.**EXACTLY**  

You should meet up with /u/malaroo, he could learn from you.It is the rough lines.  
but you can't just paste 5 bullet points and expect to have something like the legendary zelda cycle right.  
That would be like trying to explain multiverse theory in a minute without vowels.Like I said above, I think Alph might have a chance if Pikmin 4 ends up having amiibo support/an amiibo line and Alph is still in that game.  

otherwise, low chance.&gt; That's literally all it involves. It's different people's opinions on the games, and people trying to factor the way they change over time together in some omniscient cycle that is almighty and infallible, for the sake of their own opinion.

What did I say, fingers in the ears, practically can hear you go lalalalalalalalalalalala.  
That's what people liek you think the cycle is about, in order to disregard it and feel better for not following it or whatever.  

.

But hey, keep raging man, I'm having the time of my life you trying to disproof something you aren't even getting the concept off of by pointing at stuff that is incorrect as is.  
Lemme guess, you read this on some forum where someone told you about all this?    

.

Learn to open your mind, before yelling at people to close the shutters mate.Nice cover art.  
Bit (or even 'very') *standard* for a (J)RPG, but that's not really a bad thing per say.It does have stages, but "clearly defined" is subjective.  
Does a human life CYCLE have perfectly "clearly definded" cycles that have a set length and a clear start/end per cycle ?  
off course not, neither does the zelda cycle.  
it is a bit more complicated than "this&gt;that&gt;that&gt;then&gt;end"  Sorry, i didn't ask you since when you started playing.  
I said, when did you start following zelda. 

&gt;
I sure haven't, because I don't buy into bullshit like that. It's got nothing to do with Zelda. Do other people's opinions influence others? Yes, everywhere. Do people's opinions change over time? Yes, everywhere. That's all it is, not some stupid law-of-physics-esque 'cycle' that dictates the universe which surrounds Zelda games.  

Looks like you are getting there.  
You are starting to understand it, though you like to pretend you don't.  
You just summed a nice big chunk of it up.Except it is one, you are just looking to wide.&gt;
You sure do a lot of downvoting and talk a lot about "rage" when I'm supposed to be the one 'raging'. Are you sure you're not projecting?  

I said rage once, and have not downvoted you once, what are you one about?Mine were below negative a bit ago too, no reason to jump to conclusions man.  
This is a big sub.  

And you are right, i said it twice, my bad.Potentially, or more "zelda" like.  11 and a half thank you very much.No one is going, just you.  
You'll be all alone in that big concert hall.  

Also, I'll be there.ExactlyI also have a third nipple.Yes exactly.hehe, this is great.  
Actually [spoiler]("IIRC, it is cause all the souls of all the monster can barely equal a single human soul in strength. He doesn't have chara soul anymore normally speaking, but because he has all the souls in the entire underground, it equals a seventh soul power-wise")  

edit : no idea how spoiler tags are supposed to work on this sub.I doubt so.  Yeah, screw them for not making the same shit over and over again.  

The motion controls were great, and I'll miss them greatly in the next game.I just mean that you are almost never gonna be in a situation in which the shield will save you over just dodging the attack.Sorry, but then your wiimote was broken, or you were doing it wrong.  
I've played through SS countless times, and it never failed me.This one is pretty simple on the "solving" part, just obnoxious and time consuming most of the time.  This dungeon went much better than I was expecting.  
. . .OoT (Ocarina of Time) or WW (Wind Waker) probably.  

Or if you really wanna go for it, timeline order, which would mean starting with SS (Skyward Sword)Not really... no.  
Not at all even.hehe, offcourse you don't, that would be silly, heheheGoron mines is amazing in TP imo.  
And Ancient cistern is the closest thing to a water temple in SS and is also very much loved.  Have they "held" the item button for any item yet?  
I don't think they have.  Wanna know what's weirder ?  
The bracelet "copied" yuga's magic to turn into a painting and shit, however, he would have left you there as a painting forever, yet when you run out of magic, you are forced out of the wall (as opposed to being "stuck" in the wall)Nope, the fan that lifts you up is nearly useless here.  
What could have helped a lot is having the upgraded ice rod, which drops 4 ice blocks at the same time in a 2 by 2 grid.  

Also, as weird as it might sound, the fire rod would have been usefull here (well tbh, it is usefull everywhere cause it is op)Nope.  
At times he gives advice, but it is more about them figuring it both out (Arin doesn't remember all the temples from the top of his head)Did it feel like you were playing some sort of single player MMORPG where the attacks felt empty ?  
That was my biggest "complaint" about it.  There really aren't a lot of "exploration" games on the WiiU though.True, but that doesn't change that it is a shame for me to not be able to enjoy this world.  
I'm glad for all of you *lovely people*, but you know, still a shame.I never said I was lead astray though.  
I just said I find it a shame that I will not get to experience the world.  

like, it isn't a big deal, I just find it a shame, sorry for even bringing it up.they never actually used a walkthrough AFAIK.    
Well aside from Brain telling them what to do and say offcourse.Always like it when people use the instruments for other stuff.  
Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSZqPV6lxsQ) amazing video.It's automatic mariomaker music levels the game !I think the idea is more that it works better to be forced out of the wall as a gameplay mechanic :PIsn't "LEGO bricks" only refering to the.. you know... "brick shaped" ones ?  
I know the small round ones are called "studs"Jep.  
and it essentially turns ice enemies from annoying to laughable.  

only thing better is the great spin attack, but that takes superlong to get.  
Shame really, would have loved to see Dan's reaction to Link getting sucked up by Mommy Maimai.Momma Maimai only sucks up Link himself for the 100 maimai's return reward though.  
And considering they haven't even gotten the net nor the pegasus boots (as well as them never doing a game 100%) I doubt they will go for it.About the sunshine thing.  
You are sorta forced to near-complete sunshine, atleast level-wise.  
Cause you need to do all the shadow mario shines to unlock the final level (which is always shine number 7 in the main levels.)  

Also, it is good they decided not to go for all stars, cause IIRC, you can't even do so before fighting Bowser.  
The purple comet doesn't spawn until you fight Bowser."Everyone" will most definitly not be doing that.    
"first party" nintendo game does not mean it will instantly sell amazingly.  
It is still a JRPG that isn't one of the classic names, so a lot of people will disregard it already from just that.  You don't know my life.  

This isn't a xenoblade reddit. , it is the wiiU reddit.  
You might have meant thread.  
In which case : just replying.  
What, do all threads need to become even bigger echo chambers in which people repeat how this game is the second coming of jesus ?  

lemme guess, in 2 months everyone will be wondering how it is possible the game didn't seel a bajilion copies cause "nobody ever said anything bad from it"None of what you said is relevant to my comment.It is b-list at best with its sales.  
Most people only even heard from it so far because of Smash bros.  

it has a very dedicated franchise, and it is clear why it is so.  
But lets not pretend like xenoblade is a well known name on the scale of Final Fantasy or something.People are implying "everyone" will be playing it.  

It's a JRPG that isn't one of the ones that people cling to since the (s)nes times, it's on the WiiU and it is far from one of Nintendo's biggest franchises (well except for world size it seems)  

Let's not pretend like not playing the game is gonna be an anomality.Yes, and people should still be allowed to remark on their opinion on those games in the threads, even if they don't match up to yours.  

God, the Xenoblade franchise barely has its second game out and its fanbase is already amongst the most overly defensive ones amongst the N family.  

In every thread about the game, if somebody asks or remarks on something that implies they aren't as hyped about the game for some reason or another, they get downvoted like crazy with people attacking them for not being hype.Not at all.  
if anything, it is more like my opinion on God.  

I have no problem with him, but his fans... that's another thingExcept it clearly isn't, cause every time someone says something negative (or even just "non-positive/neutral) about the game/series, they are berated for it.I have not said anything about the series/game here anywhere, and whenever I do so in other threads, it is always followed by "imo"  

if anything, it is the delusions and need to gush from the xeno*fans* that gets annoying.Yes, but here is the kicker.  
If an overly defensive fan off on of the other franchises has its little tirade over it, or starts going off about it to someone who isn't a fan, they get downvoted/disagreed with by the other *"normal"* fans.    
In the xc threads, they are always the upvoted ones with the people saying it "isn't for them" in the negatives.  
This very chain's second comment is an example in itself.  

not even the metroid fanbase during the Other M fallout had it as bad.Classic as in : "(s)nes" era.I just meant a name that has been in the industry for decades by now,     
sorry for misusing a word.We all know the avergae consumer does not connect xenogears and the other xenopals with xenoblade chronicles.  
Especially since it doesn't actually have a connection story/lorewise and is made by different companies and for a different console lineI can say the same about the people saying they are hyped for the game.Lol, most of them just go "so excited" with nothing extra, don't pretend like every person that is hyped types up an encyclopedia worth of opinion about it every time.  

And I have given many other opinions about the game, the battle system is just the main issue for me, sorry for not being part of your little echo chamber.Every game is flawed, perfection does no exist.  

But there is a difference between "flaws" and "circlejerks"Yes, cause the second comment in this chain was totally being rude about it right.

I've seen more than enough times that people got downvoted/attacked for just saying they dislike something about it, even if they are being perfectly nice about it.  

The issue lies in the fact the xeno*fans* just assume anything that isn't praise is an attack to their glorious golden god.Micalaihiakaklahahaha.Isn't that a bit late ?  
both versions came out in 2014...There are many humans throughout the series.  
Any "human-like" that doesn't have pointy ears is a human.  
Human is also used as the collection of the human, sheikah, gerudo and hylian races.What is really surprising imo is that we didn't have Twilight Beasts.  
i mean, we have 2 maps that focus on twilight in the story, 2 generals that involve twilight (3 if you count dlc) and we didn't have the most iconic twilight enemies ?!!?Looks pretty fun.  
Probably gonna try to get as many zelda ones as possible.  

Only thing this screams for imo is a trading possibility.It's the same music as they use in the [Pikmin 3 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIIPkyWaiu0)  

It is also the [website theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhP8j0WzzUA)  Before I even continue reading   
&gt;Using Doctor who as an "example" for a different series  

Every fictional series makes their own rules for timetravel and the like, it is not cause Bttf, Harry Potter or Doctor Who has a certain "ruleset" that a different series like Zelda follows those rules.  

Also, the game is definitly non-canon in every way.  
And because there is no knowledge of whether the time travel is strictly backwards or not, it could indeed fit anywhere, if we are to assume it did in fact pull from any one game.  
originally, all we knew was that it only pulled from the child timeline, but now that WW is getting involved, that is no longer a fact.   

Don't forget that even crossbow training is non-canon, and that one doesn't even have any issue with it beyond a single boss enemy coming back (which could be explained with hundreds of reasons if need be)  oooh come on, I wait so long and then it will happen on the day I go to the Zelda symphonie ?!?  Pretty logical, since the mobile games are still some time away, and they did say they wouldn't release NX information until 2016That woudl eb the sort of NDA that people would be breaking en masse on anonymous sites.That is actually the original video I was talking about.  
Could also be done by just making a new wielder of the triforce of Power.They are a human sub-race, yes.

Every time someone makes something showing all the (current) grumps people say shit like this, just let the artist decide who they want to add and who they don't want to add.  

Especially since the OP said "almost all" anyway.We pretty much lost this because of recency bias already.  

If this vote was next year, nobody would be voting for Undertale anymore.  

edit : nevermind, didn't actually watch the vote yet, we are winning pretty hard, keep going guys !TBH, I have no idea. 
I'm still subscribed to this sub despite not looking at anything since the anniversary run.  I actually just copy pasted my list I have in case people say : "not like they have anyone left to add that is important"Link is just a regular boy in half of his adventures.   
Mario is a plumber.  

"anygame with a self-insert characters" just as a silly lifeguard as its lead characterMy cannon is black.  
I have a very pirate-styled cannon.  

canon-wise though, I actually prefer not limiting myself to a single color scheme for most charactersPhantom hourglass takes place in the "World of the ocean king"  

Spirirt Tracks takes place in the "light world".  

Obviously, just like how the twinrova sisters are good in Termina (MM) and Evil in Hyrule (OoT/OoX) so too are the phantoms "evil" in Wotok, and good in (new) Hyrule.    

There is no inconsistency to speak off. To actually answer your question BTW.  
I think the best additions on top of what we now have, if we are to assume another 3~4 DLC characters  

Groose  
Vaati  
Yuga  

Someone from Zelda U.Banana Dio I guess, although I love the changing colors during the fight as well. 

no[SECRET TUNNEL](https://youtu.be/umJl8t7G0q8?t=27s)Where are the ghoulgrumps people to rewind Ross's amazing alien speech ?Zelda U is gonna be a Zelda spin on the concept of an Open world, and is said to be about exploration a lot more than previous 3D games.  

not sure if /u/doodle-cactus understood what you were saying though, i think he assumed the opposite of what you were actually saying.Eh, people severally overstate the exploration aspect of zelda, especially in more recent games and when talking about just completing the main game.  

Have you played Skyward Sword yet ?  

and does your disdain for exploration extend to "figuring out a puzzle" or only finding your way ?Jep, that combined with videos not really opening up back and forth discussion is why they tend to get downvoted here.Well that's what I don't get then though.  
Cause almost all the 3D zelda games make it very clear where you need to go.  

Have you tried having a walkthrough ready for when you can't find where to go yourself?well a lot of the 2D games have a more : "go fetch" attitude.  

PH, ST, ALBW and MC are probably the ones that help you on your way the most.You forgot Medapod.Can't be.  
Name doesn't fit with the hint.sure you could, every single move works as a counter, but you need to use the right counter for the right move.Ow, also : Four Swords Adventures, Four Swords and TriForce heroes are level-based, so you very rarely need to figure out where to go, and when you do, it is in the form of a puzzle.Nah man, you also have a "do nothing" counter, which counters your opponents "do nothing" action.I could see DLC for a Zelda U character coming out near the release of Zelda U.  
And some costumes for Link, Zelda and any other character that happens to be in Zelda U.  

For triforce heroes, I sorta doubt it will happen, simply because the 2D games don't get a lot of love.  

Personally I would love to see "The Lady" being added though.Waluigi doesn't even exist in the main mario games.No, the star childeren are merely childeren born with great destiny trusted upon them.  
They are not actually related beyond Mario and luigi being brothers.*ganon  
one n.Well sheik isn't actually a "ninja" in Zelda beyond her looks and the deku nut escape now is he ?    

They don't do anything beyond teach you songs.I think a bit of a "problem" for some characters getting  weapons is that often they already have a move in their current weapon which is a reference to a different option.  

If the average of a classroom is 78/100 points,, does that mean getting a 7.5 is bad ?The "too much water" thing is even worse if you consider the fact that "too much water and trumpets" as been a fan "circlejerk complaint" ever since the gen III games and they didn't change any of it for the remakes.  

but just cause it was IGN, it now became a circlejerk joke towards them.The combat is often described as being an "over the shoulder" singleplayer version of MMORPG combat.  

Personally I found it very boring in the previous game and because of it, I decided to skip on this game.  
But a lot of people like it, so I'd say : try to see if you can "test" it out somewhere to see whether it is a thing for you or not.Or just who isn't into the style of Xenoblade Chronicles X.  All for 3DS though, they are nice to see, but I really wanted to see some good old RPGs for the WiiUDepends on how you tend to play I guess.  
if this was my situation I would start with smash in order to have all characters and stages for whe my friends come over.Every single one, 100%, without a guide on first playthrough.  
Yes, even Zelda I and AoL 

Also beat   
- Tingle's Rosie Rupeeland (amazing game), and am waiting until the fan translation of [love balloon trip](http://tingletranslation.blogspot.be/) is done.    
- Crossbow training 
- Hyrule Warriors 

Only the BS zeldas and cdi zelda I didn't.
Many people find Spirit Tracks better than Phantom hourglass, but it depends on what you actually hated in Spirit TracksFinal boss isn't very lame imo.  
It involves several fights with many different concepts tfrom throughout the game and has some great music.  It's possible to hit him the second time if you are very fast.  

Essentially, the window becomes bigger with every failed attempt.It's much better in multiplayer, especially with friends.  
but Personally I did find the singleplayer pretty interesting as well.  

Only thing I hated in singleplayer were some of the extra challenges, mostly the ones involving time. I agree, Oracle games are amazing.  
Did you turn off the game after you died?Definitly go for Rosie Rupeeland man.You beat Phantom hourglass but not Spirit Tracks?It's a cool ability, but I wonder if they will actually expand on it decently.  
If she doesn't acutally change in-game often enough, it will just be one of those "good concept, lousy execution" things.That's cause Grimbo doesn't have a house to call his own.Tingle is what we really need.Your stand looks so much better than the ugly yellow one.    
You're not the best at noticing when someone is being sarcastic/joking around are you?it's understandable though, it's a game mostly made for Japan (I assume) and handhelds are doing much better there. even more so then over hereFan levels have been mostly devoid off rageEntire series I don't really know, but generally I dislike it when they blame the game for their own ineptitude and when Arin pretends like narrative in gaming is a sin.That mostly happens in the same episodes as the ones were nothing happens though.I would get this if it actually was more effort for them.   
but it isn't.  K, seems weird considering it is Phantom Hourglass done better, but whatever.It's not like her to be anything, cause she doesn't have shit all to her.  
Being a renamed alt. costume with custom voice files (god help us all) is the best gig she can wish for.Peach already does the sports games herself.  
As well as all the Mario characters doing so in general, because guess what, they are in the spin off games anyway.  
Her competitive personality is a bullshit excuse people make up to try to get people to think she has a chance.   
every single character in the mario spin offs is competitive.  
that's sorta the point of competition-based sports and events anyway.  

And Rosalina and Bowser Jr. are in cause they are actually main characters of the series, which Daisy isn't.  
Literally every single enemy that has appeared in 2 main games has more reason to be added as a fighter as miss. pallete swap.&gt;Shouldn't we all stop bickering about who is deserving or not and appreciate Nintendo's variety of characters!  

You are the one to start this thread, whenever you propose an idea, you open yourself up to counters to said idea, way of the world, human nature and simple discussion-logic.  

Also, the reasoning of "the more the merrier would only work if Smash had infinte Development resources, but it doesn't  
every second spend on making a character like Daisy could have been used on characters from new franchises or that are actually important to their franchises or ones that create new and interesting fighting styles that fit their history.  

Daisies best bet is becoming a special alt. costume for Peach, which they should start doing more anyway imo.

Also, her personality is different in different games, and in general, being energetic in a sports games isn't exactly a personality imo.  
Her personality is a "personality" in the same way as the Koopa that appears in the spin offs has one.  

&gt;Who do you want in Smash?  

Wonder Red is my current top pick.  Probably cause it would be pretty confusing for player 1 standard Waluigi to summon waluigi AT  

In general, we have yet to have a character who is both character and AT, and I doubt Sakurai will make it happen.  
maybe next game though, but I doubt it.I agree on that fo sho.  

I doubt he has any decent chance until Nintendo allows him to appear in either the main mario or the wario series though.You aren't just talking, you are performing an Opera.  

Cloud will cost the big bucks for sure.Both of those series got characters from previous smash games as DLC, not new ones.See, I think one issue (as in, which makes it less likely as some might think, not as in "it's wrong to want that") with that reasoning is : The mario spin offs already have reps, namely, all mario series fighters are also repping the mario spin offs.  
I don't think the mario spin off series is considered a different series for Sakurai.  In want Isaac and his stage is the Opera with the chandelier Dragon.  Same reason why I fear paper Mario has much less chance then i would want him too.That was not the only, nor the main part of "too much water"  
if you had read the article you would know.\**shudder*\*Either.  

no wait, : neither : RAWRIt's not about whether it works, or how easy it is to do though, it is about whether it is something Sakurai wants.  

Remember that this is the guy that refuses to add a stage hazard switch because Playstation allstars did it first.Would be nice.  
but of a waste of potential to make him a villain for ... *her*, but whatever.Veterans, more third party characters, characters from new series, characters from series that haven't had a newcomer(this game) yet.  

or even just characters that are actually important to their franchise, even if their franchise already got a newcomer.See, the difference is that I'm not going around pretending like he is a sure deal, or even an amazing choice and making threads about it everywhere and getting upset about it when everyone else disagrees.  

However, I can very easily beat out Daisy with him,  
BEHOLD!  

***Wonder Red***  
- He is the main character of a first party IP that is not yet represented in smash.     
- He actually has direct source material to base his moves on.  
- Hideki is good friends with Sakurai  

*daidy*  
- she is the most "side" side-character a character can get, she is just a minor model edit away from peach, and the only reason she was ever given a chance in the spin offs is cause they only had a single female human in the mario series at the time.  
- Nothing she does has moveset potential, unless it is all shared by just about every character in the spin off games.    
at the very least waluigi has his whip in strikers, what does Daisy have ?  
Give me legit a single thing she does that would make a good (part of a) moveset that is unique to her in any way.  
- Almost nobody actually likes Daisy, and most of those that DO like her, would be just as pleased with her as an alt. costume.
I liked the "leg fetish" joke as much as everyone else, but it didn't make sense for Rachnee.  
she doesn't have human legs, if just the concept of legs was enough, then why didn't he feel the same way about Cerea or papi, they still have "legs"That depends on whether the zombie virus actually kills you, or only ressurects you.  
Its especially annoying considering the only reason this is the way it is is cause of recency bias.  
Don't get me wrong, Undertale is a great game, but it isn't one of those timeless classics.  

It'll be forgotten by this time next year, unlike Mario World.Personal theory : Master S. needed it cause it was sealing away everything in Frozen Hyrule as well as Ganondorf.    

We have seen several times now that magic is not eternal, and it starts to weaken over the years.  
I think the Master Sword definitly has been losing power ever since the start, however, normally it is so slow, that just an occasional chanting/being kept in the pedestal of time (OoT) is enough to keep it charged.

However, the fact it was sealing away a bunch of stuff and Ganon himself probably took its toll on the sealing/evil preventing magic.  

.

Alternativly, it is something that happens during the Era of the Flood, Maybe Ganon [cursed it](http://i.imgur.com/McYMvIU.gifv) during that escape or otherwise was able to sap its power, requiring mister and misses battery sage to be used.  

If it is like that, then I guess it would be a nice plotpoint for /u/serbaayuu's wet dream.&gt; Ganondorf's power is greater than Demise's ever was

Lol, says who ?  
Demise was the lord of all demons, his consiousness "body" was able to break free from a seal made by goddess **FOUR** times in a single games length.  
Ganondorf takes generations to do it once.  
Demise has an entire dimension to reacts to what he wishes of it.  
A spoken line of words was able to curse 3 "essenses" to be forever bound in a cycle with no end.  

What exactly points at Demise being weaker than Ganondorf in any way ?Show me a single situation in which link isn't shown as brave ?  
remember : startled or even showing signs of fear is not the same as not being couragous.  

Courage is not the absense of fear, but the force of will to voercome it.Following all of that stuff, it is probably more likely to assume his "clan/origin" has a lot of stuff from different cultures in their possesion.  

GYPSY LINK!&gt; and the two Sages were simply lost in the other timelines, but there is no evidence for this.]

or it could even be they are still chanting away, but nobody knows of them, and nobody brings it up to keep them save.I'm just talking about in the manga in general.  

I don't get why spider legs would count but horse/bird legs don'tOr no efficiency at all.  
like... anti-efficiency even, considering that they went all the way over there to get Floyd and then didn't get him.&gt;
Hylia is pretty weak as far as gods go. To compare that seal with the seven sages' seal seems mismatched.
  
Lol, based on WHAT  
What source do you have for this power ranking between Hylia and the sages their seal.  

&gt;
Except the dimension actually helping his opponent defeat him by charging his blade.  

so he was stupid, not the same as being weak.  

&gt;
I'd say that he merely stated the way things were, not actually laying the most powerful curse in the series in his death throes. Besides, his body is obliterated and every trace of his existence was sealed away by the Master Sword.  

and that explains why his reborn hate becomes the biggest villain in the series I guess.  

&gt;
Ganondorf succeeds at reaching the Triforce twice; Demise fails to do so. Also, almost everything Demise can do, Ganondorf can do. Raise an army, escape seals, dimension travel, revivals, etc.  

That has more to do with how bad the triforce was being guarded at those time than with the strength of the character.   
Demise fought against Link having the full triforce and put up a good fight.  
Ganon had the full triforce and still lost against Link with no triforce.  &gt;
Since it's a blade evil can never touch, I don't think anyone could curse it.  

The blade of evil bane thing is never shown to be anywhere near that strong tbh.  
If anything, it is more shown to be what the legends about the blade tell of it then what we actually see.  
It lost its power, so already it shows it really isn't the end-all be-all it is said to be.  

And it is not like the sword is an instakill on evil beings or anything.  
Or it could even eb the curse was supposed to do much worse then just weaken it, but the protection against evil lowered it to just making the battery die&gt;&gt;based on WHAT What source do you have for this power ranking between Hylia **and the sages their seal**.  
&gt; Golden Goddesses are the providence of the world, much stronger by default. Desert Goddess has little to no info. Goddess of Time is probably just Nayru. Fierce Deity is considered the 'bad guy' in comparison to Majora's Mask. Majora's Mask could bring down the entire moon, as compared to the land mass moved by Hylia. Also, she went full coma mode for 1000 years.

not what i asked.  

&gt;I just feel like that line he gives could be pulled by any villain ever. It's like, "Of course there's always going to be evil, and of course someone will always eventually turn the tide back and forth." Now if Demise comes back as himself, then we'll be cooking.  

Nobody has come back as themselves, every Link is different, Zelda is different, Demise his reincarnated hate is different.  

&gt;
I don't think Link used the Triforce or any of its effects on past-Demise. Also, SS Link is kinda a bad wisher lol. As for Ganondorf, that just goes to show you how powerful the Master Sword really is.  

Except that alttp uses the silver arrows to defeat Ganon as the master sword can't handle it.Same for Papi though, her legs are really only un-human-shaped at the claw part.People are afraid of death.  
This looks pretty.  

I don't mind the TP look, but I also wouldn't have minded a look like this.I liked the TP style, but I do think this is a cool look as well.eh, I think a lot of people will be put off by the changes they are putting in for no real reason and with seemingly little thought put into it.Don't think they ever said that, BUT they DID say it sold much better than anticipated.  

I think wat seanmac might have meant is that Hyrule Warriors re-"flared" the zelda love in japan (where it had been pretty low in recent years) a little thanks to it being a DW game  
And that it created more DW fans thanks to the Zelda content in the west.They have more than enough stuff left mate.  
They haven't even used up all the characters from the games they are using now, and haven't even jumped into the 2D games yet (which has twice the number of entries that the 3D games have)  

They still can easily call upon a tripling of the current cast with little effort.You trully are an enigma to me at times LLLLLink...   

You consider everything not said in-game to not count, including the very Historia itself...  
And then you burst dow the door, frame and the entire wall with something like :  
&gt;the Master Sword is a piece of time itself.eh, I get what you are saying, but most people that dislike Cloud do so because of his VERY limited connection to Nintendo, while they see (or atleast saw) Smash bros as "Nintendo all-stars and Nintendo-guests" and cloud didn't mix into that vision for them.  

That said, I get what you mean with the shovel knight love and the immense trust people have in him being added.  
that despite Shovel knight not even having been released in japan yet.....Depends entirely on whether you prefer playing these on-the-go or prefer a home console approach/control options.&gt;"So when is season two coming? There's enough content for it in the manga anyways,"

Math is hard.eh, wouldn't say that.  
I think most people would just buy any DLC or none at all, and I think the sort of people that need to be "convinced" are more likely to know about Shovel knight then Lucas or Roy, especially Roy, since Melee has been so long ago by now.  Calling yourself the ultimate crossover sounds a bit vain to me...  
obviously it is just marketting speech, but still.... it aint no smash bros based on the characters it has.I just got here, what's happening?eh, wouldn't really put a lot of priority on her personally.Mother 3 isn't as well known as SMW either though.&gt; Melee survived for years without Nintendo. Shit

but it never had to survive counter-nintendo.Lots of games that have been voted back and forth have already lost quantity of quality.  

Besides, I wouldn't say Undertale is any better than SMBW.  
Game-wise it really isn't that amazing, it is much more a great interactive story than an actual good game."classic Nintendo" 
you know they do (did?)  that cause they can't acknowledge PM without taking action against it right?&gt; there wouldn't be half of these c&amp;d conspiracy theories if you guys would admit that something happened.

[Heh](http://imgur.com/aLErdad)It's a battle for limited resources when you decide to cater to something or not during development.I can honestly say that I enjoyed Brawl and SM4SH way more than I ever enjoyed Melee, and not just cause they have more characters.Except they didn't.  
they never acknowledged it themselves, they did it all behind the scenes.  
No where will you find an official comment by Nintendo stating anything positive nor negative about PM  
However, it is known (unofficially) NoA is not just aware of it, but that several higher ups even enjoyed it a lot.  

N(oA at the least) has been keeping quit for a reason.

&gt;&gt;[We know that some members of the PMDT have been working on an original game for months under the company name "Wavedash Games" ("wavedash" is a maneuver in Melee and Project M that was unofficially named by the community). It's entirely possible that shutting down Project M is an attempt of Wavedash to distance themselves from their prior work](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3v3ipo/project_m_has_ceased_development/cxk5fic)   

&gt;[This is incredibly wrong and inaccurate. No one on the PM dev team is part of Wavedash.](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3v3ipo/project_m_has_ceased_development/cxk5fic)And they don't really know it.  

their over-doing it is gonna cause a major burn out.  
I bet it will be one of those games that nobody remembers in year or two.Yeah cheddarbison, that is laughably naive.Can you honestly say with a straight face that if you took all the story, meta-jokes, meme-bait and characterizatiom away, that undertale is a good GAME from a gameplay perspective ?  
I mean, if you can, go for it.  
But to me it ends like a very suppar RPG-schmup combo that is carried by toby's understanding of psychological reactions and storytellingCause of whisper speak and how it is associated with naughtyness for some people I would reconI get my depth in water, when I'm not in it, I prefer to keep nice and surface level.Even that was more like Nintendo blowing at them then actually holding them back.In the DLC adventure maps, you will find characters using other characters quite often.  
In some you can even find stuff like Midna using sword and shield or ghirahim using two great swords.There is a difference, undertale's charm comes from it's story and how meta it is, not from the actual gameplay.  

Even the unique bullet hell gameplay is very sup par compared to actual bullet hells.  

Undertale is much more an experience then it is a game.

.

PS: you are taking this much to personal, talk again when you have done away with your fanboy bias.  
I never said story wasn't important, I asked you to envision undertale without it in order to give an unbiased (which is hard for you it seems) vision of JUST its gameplay.  

It has and does many interesting things, but at the end of the day, it is interesting cause it does something different, not cause it does it the bestit could.  
It is an experience, something that you can only truly experience once.  

And because of that, it won't be recorded into history the same way as the other games in this list have.Better safe than sorry.  
Offcourse now they don't need it anymore, I guess...  &gt; Lmao, dude, you're the one who literally told me my "opinion" was wrong

Show me where I said that.  

Cause all I saw was : 
&gt;I mean, if you can, go for it.

.

&gt; You're passionate about SMW  

I'm actually not, I dislike 2D mario games compared to the 3D ones.  
I just know SMW has remained relevant for years now, and undertale is a "phase-game", the sort of game nobody remembers in a year unless it receives new content or sequels.  

&gt;
You continue to berate who I am as a human being. That's fine.  

nothing I said was an insult you might have taking it that way, but that is your choice, not mine.  

&gt;You can say I'm blinded,  

show me where I said that.  

&gt; whereas it seems you want more games like Super Mario World.  

nope.  
Only thing I like about SMW is the birth of Yoshi.  

&gt;
Basically whenever you acted like you knew something. "And because of that, it won't be recorded into history", "Even the unique bullet hell gameplay is very sup par".  

that is not the same as saying your opinion is wrong.  
If you took it that such : not everyone is an attack to you, you say I don't accept other opinions yet YOU are the one feeling attacked by my opinions, think about that for a second.  

&gt;
Cave Story would like a word with you. And yes, you could definitely say that it's longevity was due to being ported to 3DS, Wii, and Steam. But then the same could happen to Undertale down the road so who knows.  

Cave Story is really not even CLOSE to as popular as it once was.  

&gt;I mean, "talk again when you have done away with your fanboy bias", and "which is hard for you it seems" can pretty much only be taken in negative ways. Like, it's cool if you want to insult me, that's basically the internet, but that's basically what they are.  

Neutral wording is not the same as an insult.  
I didn't say : "you are just to fucking retarded in order to see this" or anything, I asked you to consider Undertale's chances and position without using your love for it to do so.    
The very fact you say stuff like :  
&gt; But gosh darn if I can't hope that it won't. Because I think it's deserving of more.  

Already shows you are letting bias determine your reasoning.  

I **LOVE** wonderful 101, but it would be extreme bias of me to think it will go forward in history as a game remembered by the gaming community on large.    
I want it too, but nothing I said was about wanting.  
Everything I have said so far is based on what I think will happen based in no part on what I want to have happen.  

&gt;
For the past two posts you've pretty well cherry picked my paragraphs out for anything that you might find wrong, but then just kinda ignored everything else? Which is fine, I guess.  

You prefer I copy everything and then say : "nothing to add here" about it ?  
These comments are already getting needlesly long, and you apparently already feel attacked by my wording.&gt;&gt;You put a lot of words in my mouth   

&gt; Not look down on others, or think that they're wrong about their opinions. 
How so ?  
Master Sword is still the blade of evil's bane in the fallen timeline (for some time) isn't it?  
It's just that Ganon became stronger because of the full triforce.&gt; (if you want to see a piece on this take a look at the Game Theorists video on the Timeline).

bruh... sssssssh  

We don't talk about that hack on this sub Xd

.

also, your reasoning with the timeline is flawed.  
We know the reason for the adult/child timeline split.  
we merely don't know about the reason for the fallen timeline split, that does not mean there isn't a reason at all though.WW is essentially the one game where using that reasoning doesn't work at all.Apples to oranges is a silly comparison considering they have a lot in common on a universal scale.  Again, I'm not attacking you, you are feeling attacked for no reason.  

Nobody is preventing us from being friends.  
in fact, if I "didn't like you", I wouldn't have answered 5 comments ago to begin with,  

not sure what you are going on about on that aspect.&gt;Why can't it become a "timeless classic"?  

Cause it is a one-time-experience type of deal as well as being a product of the current times.   
Undertale is carried on the concept of Toby knowing what you will be thinking/doing before you do so.  

Because of this, the game can't "catch" you with the same tricks twice.  
For example, you won't ever be surprised by the fact the game remembers what you did despite resetting again.  

because of that, it lacks the repitition needed to trully remain captured in people's (collective) minds.  

There have been games like this before you know...   
Games that were more about "outplaying" the player's thought process than anything else.    
Undertale is far from the first game of its genre/feel.    

Add to that that it is a pretty niche game and an indie near-one-man-made game, and you get a game that will need to survive on a cult following while not having the bonus off having sequels come out fast enough to keep the ball rolling.  

&gt;People will still be talking about this game next year (though not as much as they are right now). Shovel Knight was made last year and people have pretty consistently talked about that game since.  

Shovel knight dropped down a LOT until right before Plague of Shadows was announced/released.  
And Shovel Knight is a retro platformer, which is a much bigger genre popularity-wise.    

Shovel knight also the advantage of being something that will almost certainly become a franchise going forward.  
based on Toby's actions and philosophies, it will not have that.  

&gt;People will still be talking about this game next year  

RemindMe! One Year "It's a bet" And just like different fruits have different expiration dates, so do those different genres/games.  

you are correct.Especially considering the scientist X that was about the crash the ship shows us they are even capable of advanced planning and self-sacrifice for the sake of the species.X-parasites as a whole, SA-X when pointing at one.  &gt;You say that as though nothing he say can be trusted rather than give evidence for a refute of the argument itself. That sounds like an Ad Hominem to me.  

Rather : **IF** there is ANYTHING of actual worth in his videos, It would be much better if you actually quoted it, or atleast pointed at a timestamp or place a link to it, as opposed to expecting people to listen to him rattle on about his headcanons that are rejected by the games themselves or simple logic  

&gt;I never said we don't know the reason for any of the splits. I said that it is a physically impossibility to have both the death and life be an outcome that exist in the same space.  

They are different timelines, Time = space, so no, they do not exist in the same "space", they exist in a fractured temporal situation.&gt; What do you consider to be a timeless classic then? It seems you have many reasons why Undertale isn't/can't be one, but I'd be interested to use the same rubric on a game that you consider a timeless classic.

Tetris

&gt;Personally, I think Undertale has much more replay-ability than you're giving it credit for. With its multiple endings and the way the game changes depending on how you play it, I think the game does a good job at making you feel like their choices really do matter.  

it has 3 actual endings.  
In this day and age, not a lot of people spend time doing something like play the game over just to get a different phonecall.  

&gt;Right, but neither is Super Mario World. The game doesn't have to be the first in its genre. The point is that it's one of the best.  

I meant that Undertale is far from the first time people went crazy over a game that outsmarted them/tugged on their heartstrings, but guess what, almost none of them are remembered now.  
statisically speaking, Undertale has a rough time ahead.  

&gt;You talk like having a cult following will prevent Undertale from becoming a timeless classic, but I highly disagree. Earthbound had/has a cult following and is in a very similar situation as Undertale, yet I'd consider Earthbound to be a timeless classic.  

how many people do you think would actually still be talking about earthbound if it hadn't been for Mother 3, the defiance of NoA to release it there and more importantly, Ness and lucas being in Smash ?  

&gt;
It's hard to say what will be and won't be a "timeless classic" since the whole point is that years down the line people will be able to enjoy the game just as much as as people did when it first came out. Personally I think the cult follow will keep the series alive for years to come and the clever writing, lovable characters, and stylized graphics will allow people to enjoy the game no matter how far in the future they play it.  

And I wouldn't risk money on it, based on previous situations.  
Guess we'll see, but I doubt it will happen.  

you are free to think otherwise though.  The average consumer is more likely to spend 15 than 40 on a game made by a *"no name"* company   

It's sad that that is how the market is right now, but it is what it is.Maybe if all the tracks are straightways XdThat's cause you are repeating the same stuff the others have said, with slightly different words, yet you say it less... eloquently.   
So I decided to focus on the part of your comment that was interesting.[Man, good thing Dan made Arin hurry to the plot, wouldn't have made it with the 2 second detour](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/icnVUugHP7Y/maxresdefault.jpg)It created 3 seperate "timelines/universes" yes.  &gt;So I had a good point, but you don't know what to say so you focused on a very specific part of my comment you could argue against  

More like : "I've already had this conversation 2 times in this chain, and 5 times today, go look at those comments if you really want an answer"  

&gt;Then when I call you out on it you insult me  

where did I insult you ?You are letting other acts of ficition decide your options.  
The Zelda timeline is essentially a single universe until the events of OoT, which (for reasons we have no way of verifying) caused a "many worlds" situation, but not in the traditional sense of the word.  Ok, what is your reasoning on only acknowledging these 4 terms and not other options?  

&gt;Also, why does only the death of Link in OoT cause a Fallen Timeline? Shouldn't all the possible deaths of the Hero in each game also cause a Fallen Timeline?  

Cause it is not the death itself that causes the "break" is what I would recon, but rather, it is the same deal as with the child/adult timeline.  
It is something in the other timeline causing a singular split.  

Also, cause none of the other deaths during OoT (or even the entire series) are canon, while this one is.&gt;If you've argued it so many times it should be a problem to basically copy and paste your previously made responses. I shouldn't have to sift through your old responses to know what rebuttal is, that's your job.  

you get paid for a job.  

&gt;As far as when you insulted me:
you say it less... eloquently.
the part of your comment that was interesting.  

.

&gt;It also seems I'm not the only one who thinks you've been rude. As I started to look at your other comments someone else called you out for being rude too. Perhaps you should reevaluate the way you speak to others since you seem to be coming across as rude to people you disagree with.

There is a difference between rude and insults.  
neither of those things are meant as insults.  (and imo are hardly really rude either, but ok)  
THe other guy wrote several walls of text when speaking, you had 2 little blocks with neither of the two actually raising anything special imo.  

Do you honestly consider someone saying : someone else said something more "eloquently", as an insult?  
if I tell you that I find someone elses artwork nicer, would you consider it an insult?  

This is an insult : You write like a retarded monkey that was drugged, and I don't talk to animals.  (this is an example, before you start saying I'm insulting you now"    

Saying I found your comment less interesting than someone elses' comment is hardly an insult imo.  
If that honestly "hurt" your feelings and felt like an Insult, then I apologise.&gt;Then what is "the deal" with the child/adult timeline that caused the split? If you claim that it isn't the death that separates the timeline but that it is something else you have to provide evidence of what that "something else" is.  

In adult/child timeline it is zelda sending Link back in a different way from what creates the stable time travel otherwise, which causes the split.  

In fallen hero, we don't (yet) know what is the actual cause as it is not something Link is privy too, so neither are we (atm)  

&gt;The death of every Link is canon because otherwise he could not be reincarnated via the curse Demise placed. Therefore Links death (and Hylia/Zelda's) is absolutely canon and essential otherwise games outside of the originals could never be considered canon.  

I meant the deaths during the game, the ones you were talking about before. What other shit are you talking about ?Wait... you mean Nintendo doesn't send a guy in a suit and a spiked baseball bat to your house to check on your WiiU log every other week ?!None of the deaths during gameplay are canon.  
If you fall below 1/4th of a heart without a fairy and get a game over.  
THAT isn't canon.  

And thus, as they aren't canon, they also don't create fallen timelines.  

&gt;"stable time travel" or "we don't know the actual cause"  

The cause is the fact Zelda sends Link back with the ocarina of time.Personally I enjoy it even more as I consider all smash comics with "Samus" in them to be the suit on autopilot.  
Sass-suit&gt; But then what about the deaths of Link after the events of the game due to old age, sickness, or any host of other causes? Are those deaths considered canon?

Yes, but why would those create a fallen timeline ?  
The point of the fallen timeline is that OoT Link failed in his quest.  
If the Links die of old age when there is no evil in the land, what is there to create a fallen timeline?  

&gt;EDIT: If "we don't know the actual cause" wouldn't be it best to go with the best explanation via occam's razor? So what explanation can you give that satisfies the simplicity argument?  

We know the cause, the cause is Zelda send Link back.  
We don't know the specifics, but just cause I can't tell you how a gun works doesn't mean I wouldn't be able to tell you the  (usage of) gun is the reason someone died.  

We don't know what causes Magic in Harry Potter to work the way it does, but we know it does what it does.&gt;Of course, I agree. But if you can't tell me how it works it stands to reason that he who comes up with the most logical and simple explanation via occam's razor is the one that should be utilized until new evidence sheds a new light on the matter.  

Yes, but this explanation still has to end up within the confines of the canon we have.  

And your explanation ends with :
&gt;I should note that what this means is that the only way one can claim that both all the games are canon as well as the official Nintendo timeline being correct is by asserting the many worlds (or multiverse) theory, as it applies to The Legend of Zelda. But since Nintendo does not assert this while still claiming the validity of the games you can argue that **the timeline is not valid**.  

And 
&gt; that the only way one can claim that both all the games are canon as well as the official Nintendo timeline being correct is by asserting the many worlds (or multiverse) theory,  

This isn't True, cause the many worlds explanation works on the idea that EVERYTHING creates a split, but the timeline shows that only specific actions have caused a split.  
namely : Zelda sending Link back in time for the Child/Adult split, and an unknown action following Link's death causing the fallen timeline to split off from the initial branch.   

We might not know WHAT caused the fallen timeline branch, but it is much more logical that it is an unknown event, than that every single action creates a timeline.He already announced his new channel before all this PM drama, stop trying to pin shit on him he clearl isn't doing.Or a curse, as before while he would feel "bad", he'd atleast be able to go "ah well, nothing to do about it now, I'll just doublecheck next time"  
now he never has an excuse to not go change stuff.Yeah, cause the front page definitly can't handle some distraction from the PM drama right now...  
It's his fullest right to make a thread about this, and considering how important exposure is for a content creator, he would be stupid to not do so, even if something unrelated is "going down"&gt; And why is that? Doesn't a new game add to the canon and not confirmed to what preexists? How else would we get new characters? There is nothing that says it can't.

There is a difference between existing outside of the current canon/having no influence on it, and working against it.  

THere is also a difference between what the creators do, and what we "fantasize" about.  

&gt;The fact that the timeline does not show every outcome is not any evidence that it is not the case. That is the argument from ignorance's position and is a fallacy.  

the fact they have said it are these 3 and no other timelines already disproves that option.  

&gt;How can you claim to know the cause of the Child/Adult split while simultaneously claiming to not know the cause of the death split when they are all referred to in the same matter?  

Cause we see one happening, and we don't see the other.   
Notice how one split happens before the other.  
It isn't a 3-way split that happened, it are 2 2-way splits.  
We (the player) are not present to see what causes the firs tone.  
Assumingly because whatever changes between Link being triumphant or not isn't shown to Link directly.  

&gt;All it says is that "The Hero is defeated" and "The Hero is triumphant" are what cause the splits.  

No, it shows what the important results are within the split.  
the results are BELOW the point the lines split off, because they happen AFTERWARDS.  
Notice how there is no text saying what caused the child-adult split either, it only shows the results : "the sacred realm remains protected" and "Ganondorf is sealed"  

***NOWHERE*** does it say Link being triumpant is the cause for the split, it says it is the **RESULT** of the split/the difference the split made.  

&gt;
It is significantly easier to assert much more simple claims such as "many-worlds: some shown,some not".  

It is often times easier to just go "whatever, world is flat" than it is to triangulate stuff to determine the world is round, yes.  
Guess which of the two is correct though.
Dunno, seems to me Arin hates stuff in video games that he would love in other situations.Aw, Dan is waving at us   
[HI DAN](https://youtu.be/4JwBaLrgzUY?t=42s)Cloud is a stupid addition&gt; If there were two 2-way splits then there would be four timelines. Are you claiming that?

Nope, simple math

------------ one timeline  

Splits in two  

---S--------- Timeline A  
.....\\---------Timeline B  

some time later, a second plit happens in ONE of the two timelines.

--S---------- Timeline A    
.....\\--S------Timeline B    
..........\\-----Timeline C  

.

.

.


This is opposed to a threewy split, which would be 

A single timeline  
------------------ Timeline

Splitting into 3  

............\/--------Timeline B  
---------S------- Timeline A  
............\\------- Timeline C  that is irrelevant to my statement, there is still a clear moment at which he no longer has a way to "Fix" anything.  
nor can he fix anything send away before that time.  ha~ha, topical.Those are some fresh pigs alright.Then they would have a 2D Mario platformer with HD sprites like that.It's mostly the other side of the issue.  
the fact people just throw down the "full price" of a game just cause of who made it, often even before it is done, or even if the game isn't good.  

And the fact any big company can just decide to place the price on the standard price even if the content does not fit that price.There really is no point in doing this.  

Just give them this.  
it's just gamefaqs anyway.shortest gamegrumps series that wasn't meant as a one off.how did the spike go down if both are values that only ever rise ?I hadn't watched this series yet.  
Guess I have no choice but to watch this now...Aw, I thought this was gonna be about a fanmod adding in a 2-player option.  
I was gonna propose using the Sprites from Hyrule warriors and to make the second player be Tingle as the standard :/  

&gt;Then don't pay for it.  

genius reasoning.  

I'm talking about the state of the market, not my situation, I don't *actually* pay for games anyway.WOOW, what a long chain that was.  
Well they weren't done yet completely, that might be a part of it.Make him summon Dante from the devil may cry series /jkNah man, we have that one assist trophy, clearly that's more than enough !Or maybe they are announcing Tabuu as a playable character.&gt; Roy and Marth weren't even going to be in the localized Smash Bros. until the Western audience showed appeal for them, 

I belief it was more that they just didn't want to have the western version have less content, and didn't have the time to replace them with western picks, so they just thought of them as extras for the west.  

Only later did they find out it actually ended up being a good call.Yeah, I would love free publicity as well if I had a character to sell.I was actually just trying to act silly because of the "tinfoil hat reasoning" in the way people are trying to determine what the announcement is gonna be, but I changed it around so much that it didn't end up sounding sarcastic at all...  

.

That said, I think tabuu would have been the most logical choice for a "smash rep".That's my reaction to PM shutting down.It's still the same way as before.You can use hindsight all you want, but Snake had actually appeared as a main character on a nintendo console before and wasn't the posterboy of Square "leaving" nintendo.  

Besides, we all know why Snake actually made it into smash.  Well yeah, I thought that was implied already.Cause it is epic, even in a small snippit.  

Also, it was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, who is one of the biggest Final Fantasy composers&gt;or they are just dumb  

Exactly yes.  

Which is why the state is in a bad place to begin with.  
If people were actually judging things logically and based on quality, then all the companies that rip you off for half-made games would be dying right now.Now you can do it after already being disconnected IIRC.  
As opposed to needing to do so while still being connectedYes.  
and the first game has a subtitle.  

The first game's subtitle is : "the legend of zelda"  

Shocking I know, and I'm not sassing you, the first game's actual name is : "The hyrule fantasy : The legend of zelda"  
(or it was the other way around, not sure tbh.)I voted Ages cause Seasons is better imo, and I think you should always keep the best for last.  

the "sign up" pop up with white close over the white banner is just the perfect prelude to this site and article.In what way ?  
It was relevant to the character they just announced, and it is a theme that is in both SM4SH and is pretty iconic to the series.  

I think people are severaly overestimating the "hint dropping" nintendo/sakurai are apparently supposed to do.  

has Sakurai EVER teased stuff in that way beforehand?What about if he had been in from the start?We are not planning to give a week to a game just cause it finished development.  yeah, this will definitly show the right face of the PM community outwards.The music was made by the composer that is mot known for his work on FF music.That's not how that works though.  
And people see the smash games as having bad fanbases all the time because of shit like that.  Are you the idiot that made [this report](http://imgur.com/sUCsSCG) ?  
Show me a C&amp;D notice or shut up.Show me a C&amp;D that the PM has recevied from nintendo and HAL and not only will I appologize, but I will make you a mod.  

if you can't then just stop trying to be edgy and piss off.very nicely made.Sure bud.  
Until then, just shut up about it.While I agree most of the times, I think "muda" should really only be translated once, as opposed to the barrage they do whenever Jotaro and Dio end up clashing.I'll be sure to write it in as my new years resolution.Buy Wonderful 101  GER is nothing to pants-shit stand.I'd be ok with translaing it once per episode with a simple "Muda=useless".  
But placing it across 2 full lines during things like the fucking opening is so stupid, just ruins the moment a little.Nothing, but what would be the big deal if we didn't do this?  
None of the other games have gotten "weeks" dedicated to them unless it was for a content thread in which case everyone got their own turn.  I think that's what most people mean with "dead"Design changes between games.  I'm pretty sure Their main use is gonna be to be natural barriers.    

I hope we might see a big goron city (or multiple cities) across multiple mountains.  

It could be interesting if we got a rock climbing move near the end to open up a lot of shortcuts and reveal secrets and stuff.

Seems round in both eras  

The N64 version was pointy case of the time though.Prime is actually clawing it's way back at skyrim.  
When I voted quite some hours ago, Prime was losing with like ~15 percent.  

Now they are almost equal.skyrim is at 50.65 and prime is at 49.35 for me  
It looks like it is stabbing her in the neck imoAnything that can speak is clearly already to old.I don't.  
PM also already got the most support out of every non-official smash "project" we have ever given to any.  

We can all sit here and pretend PM is the redheaded stepchild for no reason, but we all know why PM is in the situation it is in.  

Please do not pretend like PM has never received anything here or anywhere else.  

Either way, I have forwarded your *idea* to the rest of the mods, but I personally doubt they will want it any more than me.Eshop &gt; Type in zelda (or click "newest arrivals) &gt; should be there.By beating the bosses of the Ruins and the Dunes.  

Edit : or did you mean the new 9th area ?  
Cause for that one you need to update, not sure if you also need to lift the Princess' curse or not.They sorta already did, tingle has his own spin off series.  

And so to answer : I don't think we will ever not have Link be atleast one of the playable characters in an actual "Legend of zelda" game, but I think spin offs might be a thing sometimes.  
That said, I sure hope they don't take sheik.  
Not sure what game you played, but in MY copy of OoT, Sheik didn't do shitall, all they did was teach me songs to reach places I lready had been, get their ass handed to theirself by bongo bongo and throw fucking nuts to blind me, just so they could make jackass "batman-act"The last 3D zelda was not a princess, and the reincarnation curse has no reason to force Zelda to be a princess.well they are launching a new account system, so lets hope that fixes a lot of stuff.Phil seems like a pretty nice guy too.  
Might just be his PR people though.  

And Conan is hilarious.  
He's so great at making funny insults I would pay to get roasted by him.It being the best game ever is my "memory" of the game.  yeah, and apparently Deadmau5 will also be therem no doubt delivering the music, and he is a pretty cool dude too imo.  
Shame it isn't Deadgoa7 thoughSo, seems like it is something they changed in the remake.  

Guess having the triforce of power made your ears pointy in 1998  

or maybe they just sorta changed it halfway and forgot about it or something.I did this solo with Doppelbros, went through the entire den without even losing more than 4 hearts at a time.  
Lost all 9 fairies to those bastards.    

Then I took big bomb outfit, and cheesed them by holding a bomb above me, running circles around the entire arena and throwing them when they were about the explode.  (you can also hold on to them and swap to a safe doppel right before the explosion if the shadow links are close enough)  

Essentially, don't try to fight them fair, they don't fight fair themselves, so try to find a way to cheese them.  


So, what is everyone's take on the update ?  
Personally I found the den a bit easy except for the massive spike at the end, which wasn't really "difficult" as much as it was something nearly forcing you to cheese it.  
I loved it thematically though.  

Also find it interesting the 2 costumes that wouldn't exactly make sense to be in that part of the timeline would happen to end up being DLC.  
What do you guys recon, is the existance of these costumes canon to you, or not?  

Honestly, if this is the first near-release and free update, then I hope this isn't just them barging in guns blazing and that they actually kept some ammo for continued fire.  
If the rest of the free updates are even half of this calliber they will all be very much worth it.  

I can only hope that if they go on with the DLC, and might venture into paid DLC for this game, that is is merely the tip of the iceberg.  

Lastly : Every time you enter a reward chamber, you get some text across the screen that is written as if shouted by an announcer or spectators, and how they are surprised at how well you are doing.  
What do you guys recon for this?  
Just some positive player reinforcement, or maybe a sign that we are being watched inside the Den ?  
Either by someone pulling the strings, or by the townsfolk or something.?I bet/fear that Phil Spencer and SHAWN! layden would probably actually be better at it than Reggie is.I thought this was pretty obvious tbh.  
It's a "special broadcast", if it was a True "direct" I think they would have called it that.  
They know the name is synonymous with wet boxers and panties for the Nintendo fans by now.&gt;Spyro (for that PlayStation trio hype)?   

A bit on the side, but I find it funny that many characters people associate with "playstation one" are essentially more "nintendo" than cloud.  
Spyro and Crash have both appeared on Nintendo consoles as the main lead.  
Strange to think about.  
Sorta like a sony version of realizing Sonic "now" lives on Nintendo, back in the day.

.

back on track though :   
&gt; Cloud is probably the teaser this time around.  

how can they beat cloud though?  
I mean... I don't even like the bastard('s inclusion) and even I can't deny that it is hard to top his inclusion...  

Let's go bigger, if he wins, he can have . . . uhm . . . Mother series (that one won't be getting sequels anyway, sorry mother fans)  
If Reggie wins (which I wouldn't put money on considering Reggie VS Hbox.... ) smash doesn't just get Banjo... NINTENDO gets Banjo.  His nickname is trintroll for a reason.It's only for a short while...  
But yes, [you can](http://i.imgur.com/PUI5pju.jpg)Well ever wave has been a mix and match thing so far.  
Although they mostly focussed on fighting game costumes during the ryu release, so maybe this set will have a bunch of (j)rpg costumes.  
(not sure if I should fear for, or hope for, an Isaac costume.)Still hoping for Red as playable myself.  
Almost no chance, but whatever.I changed your flair to Project M, I mean, you are the mod of the mod, so it makes more sense to have that flair I'd say.It's not a direct though.  
Or atleast they didn't call it that.  

They specifically said : "Special Broadcast"  
As far as we know, it might be shown off during the game awards.Nothing confirmed yet, but it is very likely Nintendo will show SOMETHING off during the game awards.  
(not to mention the Iwata tribute)Fire Emblem alreayd got costumes during the Roy release anyway.  
With the chrom and black knight costumes.  

I could definitly see Golden Sun costumes (specifically Isaac), the ones you mentioned and Chrono Trigger costumes.  

Pokemon costumes a bit less though...  
if only because of how annoying the pokemon company is, and even during Mewtwo's wave we didn't get any pokemon costumes.  
A trainer costume would be awesome though.  

Even better : have a Ranger (gunner with the capture thing as a gun), Trainer FR/LG (brawler) and a Trainer using a HONEDGE !!!! (swordfighter) !I have the opposite situation.  
I saw the box in the store a whole bunch of times, but I could never figure out what the game was about because of the tiny yet hectic pictures on the back, but I saw it had a bunch of (random) pokemon, but also Link and mario and so I had no idea what it was.  
I actually delayed buying it for other (great) games several times.  
until I finally bought it and thought : WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING ?!  [Oh ow](http://i.imgur.com/GHOgFpa.png) :   

.

[THIS JUST IN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYmn3Gwn3oI)Yeah, the main issue in solo if you try to do it for real, is that not only can you come up against one guy using hookshot+, one guy using KokiriBow and one guy using Flameglove+...  

but when they hit you, you either need to swap to a save dobbel, or else they get a second free hit in, cause they will walk inside of you during the invincibility, and follow you exactly at the same speed, meaning they are touching you when you lose your damage invinc. , and you can't hit them away cause you are cursed.  

Shit's fucked up.  Crash and Spyro have both had games on Nintendo consoles by now though, they haven't been "playstation series/games" since the end of the playstation 2 era.  

However, comparativly, they also haven't been... "relevant" since around that time.  
Unless we consider Spyro as a rep for the skylanders now Xd.  
Jep.  
[Crash's games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot#Reception)  
 have appeared on all platforms ever past [the third one.]  (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ba1zDRI5qqs/maxresdefault.jpg)    (this list shows only the playstation boxes, but everything on the second row is multiplatform)  

[Spyro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyro_(series) had also been everywhere, even before they decided to turn him into a skylander.Honestly, after some practice, the only missions I find harder with doppels is time-based ones.  
for all the rest, having invincible partners makes it easier to me.  

Also, ice platforms that break/lava platforms that sink and sand are a little bit more annoying, but aside from that, doppels are frankly far superior to the average online player (and most of my friends with the game). . . sad as it might be.  

PS: one way I think you might be able to "easily" do the mission in co-op (with people you know) is to do the same strategy, but to avoid friendly fire, use 2 people with serpent's toga.  
They can just stand still, might even distract the shadows a little ? Not sure.  

Otherwise : one person with kokiri bow using his arrows to detonate the bombs faster, but that requires some real teamplay.  

but in general, without some "broken" strategy, I don't see anyone finish that fight and still have genuine fun.Cause this is (has become) a circlejerk subreddit mate.  Some nice music.What concepts or moves does she take from them?Some nice music.What would your guess be for a Midna costume effect ?  
Well the bombs are also cause her moveset is based on crossbow training.Most important one out of the bunch I all played at once : Wonderboy in Monsterworld.  
Amazing game that created my life for gaming.That would be cool as well, but personally I don't see it happening.that would be interesting fo-sho.  

otherwise, if they want to get a page out of Hyrule Warriors book, maybe you could have a golem-wolf with you that helps out :D  
Unlikely, but still...  

I guess it would also depend on what sort of DLC she would be in, if they made a twilight-focused map, which has something like "twilight zones" that hurt you when you enter, the effect of the midna costume could eb to ignore those.  
For the regular zones it could ignore the damage of the "stick close to the orb" missions.
Skyward Sword.  

Zelda was not a Princess in that.That's not the last 3D zelda, unless we count the remakes.  
But yes, that one indeed also has a non(current) royal zelda.  

Either way, there is nothing in the actual reincarnation curse forcing her to be active royalty.    Eh, it would depend on what the wolf could actually do, and whether it could be attacked.  

Like, if it only had 3 hp or something, and when killed you couldn't get i back until the next room.  

I just doubt it would be something that would happen cause it would require an entirely new model and AI coding, etc... Nothing official so far.  

Only thing we know is that (ONLY) the characters will be transferable if you buy the 3DS version.  

but apparently it will be done by use of a download code in the packaging(/receipt for eshop version)  
So that would imply they are making a DLC pack with the characters in for the WiiU.  

So it would be pretty stupid for them to not allow for seperate purchase as well.    

.

Real question will be whether the other content will come to WiiU as a DLC pack or not.  
We know it won't be "transferable" from the 3DS code, but besides that we have no information on it.Yes exactly, all the same though, she is not forced to be a "princess", especially not storywise.E&gt;Did any of them actually connect their IRL name to P:M ?  Pretty sure this guy would.Sure you will.  
End of humanity is a nice ending point.Nice.. . . how ?  

How did you find this within 9 minutes in a deleted thread?Sounds logical.&gt; It's amusing to me that the Linebeck costume makes it easier to get particular loot when there is virtually no reason to farm for loot in this game, since simply doing all the challenges will gain you far more than enough of everything to make every costume.

Maybe some future DLC costumes will require more material.  
Although I doubt it.  

They also made getting extra gold material easier by increasing the chance of getting it in the colloseum.   
So now you don't even NEED to complete all the challenges to get all the costumes.  
(well you never "needed" to before, but now the alternative is even easier)  

&gt;
Great question. I'd have to say they're either not quite canon or in-world they are merely coincidental. Perhaps Madame Couture is able to channel a certain intent to her magic without being aware of what's influencing her.
Alternatively we could suggest that both the Fierce Deity and Linebeck might have existed at some point in the Fallen Timeline - not much of a stretch for Linebeck, but that would be odd for the Fierce Deity.

Well you get the Fierce Deity Mail from the Den of Trails.  

I guess Linebeck could have indeed existed in that timeline (and apparently be more succesfull at getting actual treasure)  
And perhaps the Fierce Deity Mail is just that... the armor/equipment that Fierce Deity Link wears, which could have existed in that timeline too, and ended up in Hytopia.  
Or be like a "light world" version of the armor, or be based on a light world version of the Fierce Deity.  

(it is also gained after a "gauntlet" of all the previous areas, somewhat reminiscent of MM's moon dungeons)Something I did find interesting is that they are definitly playing up the "Fierce Deity is terrifying to others" thign, even up to the point that they repeat Majora's idea that FD is like a villain.  

However, this time there is no "tag-oni" situation to explain why Trippini would think that.  
(unless tripinni ends up being Majora or something crazy XD, Trippini ultimate boss confirmed)IIRC, it was announced for the japanese pre-orders/limited editions, but this is the first time it is shown off.  

this doesn't even look like her.  
Or atleast not any more than 2 blond slender woman would always look alike.nah dude, a field filled with grass, some radom animals and some skyline mountains, which gamexplain will talk about for half an hour.***SHAAAAAAAAAWN***  

(probably one of my favorite glitches of all time)[No dude, you don't get it, those birds flew away when we approached, that means there will be a stealth element involving wildlife.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad-WbLhXUYs)why is the doll drowning ?  
Unless this one isn't actually a doll ?&gt;Also, Link can jump, he can just only do it by running toward a ledge.  

depending on the link we are talking, he can do so with a roc's feather.Cause Palutena sucks at being a goddess bro.  
the entire game she needs Pit to solve everything.  

She can't actually really do anything beyond support magic.It stuns otherwise, which might actually be better.Cause the only character he can suck into himself without the hypernove fruit is Olimar.Being a goddess means very little in Nintendo worlds.  
Especially so for Plautena, who is outclassed by just about every other character in Uprising.  

Remember that Palutena is based on the concept of "gods" relative to greek/roman gods, not "current" gods which are just badly written (really, god is everywhere, anytime, can do anything and is both vengefull and forgiving at the same time?, boring character right there)  
Palutena needs Pit to solve everythingHow is Kirby so high?  
he can't absorb anyone except maybe some of the pokemon, rob and Olimar.  
He's little more than a beachball to them.  

also DK can punch the moon out of orbit, and has bested primates with full mastery of martial arts.  
Bowser survived a supernove in the face.  

meanwhile, megaman dies from just touching spikes.  
like... POOF. Instantly gone.  

Ike is strong, but he is just a swordsman.  
in what way would he ever be that high?  
And in general, you place all the fire emblem characters higher than Mario who has superpowers and fucking bowser who can turn into the size of a skyscraper ?!  

And Young Link higher than practically immortal angels with vastly superior hightech god-weapons ?!  
Like... seriously ?  

Also, talking about those Angels.  
Pit is the one doing the heavy lifting, wanna know why?  
Cause palutena can't do shit on her own.  

besides, [Hades said it best](https://youtu.be/Zd2Etn-BUEE?t=17s)  afterall : 
&gt; the narrative always takes priority.An invisible, untouchable gunner that shoots from out of sight with light-bullets ...  
Duck Hunt is practically higher than anything that can't handle those shots if we think about it.  
No clue.  
Do download players get the lady materials when they finish bosses ?  
Cause that is the way you obtain the outfit.Goku, shrek, shovel knight, shantae, Reggie, Jackie Chan, the whole lot of them.  
Sky's the limit from now on.  
With which I mean the only one that wouldn't work would be Ridley, cause he is to big.  
kraid or Phantoon would be cool though.Then i doubt they get the armor.Award show is today, no word on **SPECIAL BROADCAST** (never been said it was gonna be a direct)Nice meme, boss.[It's inevitable](http://www.gameranx.com/img/14-May/ssb4-reggie-1.jpg)Nintendo doesn't have the right to dig for that for no reason.  
If screenname Henryuuk makes a mod, and then later on O.W.L. entertainment makes a game with the same genre, and O.W.L. has no relation to Henryuuk, they will be hard pressed to connect the two.  
especially since even if they did, it wouldn't give them a sure win.  

Copyright is fucked up right now, but it isn't as fucked up (yet) as most armchair lawyers here seem to think.Ludicolo but no shiftree ?  That would make PERFECT SENSE... **IF** it wasn't for the fact every other attack rush works the same way.i think tis is more on Tecmo than on Nintendo.Maybe a new costume set ?  
or new weapons for the both of them?  
Phantoms were created by bellum, yet they appear in the Light world all the same.  
Things in the alternate worlds tend to have counterparts in the light world in some way.  

It cis True that the Terminian version is made (albeit IIRC what Aonuma said specifically was that "the soul inside the mask" was the hopes and dreams of all of Termina) from the Terminian collective will.  

But that doesn't mean it can't have a counterpart in the light world made/created in a different way.HH says Termina is one of the parralel worlds.  Don't know, but I would assume so, yes.I completed it in singleplayer all the way, didn't die once until the final room, then lost ALL NINE FAIRIES!  

Then I swapped outfits and Won XD  

It was real full.  
All I wished was that each Link was allowed their own outfit....I don't think so either, as nothing had been said about it.  
And the rewards you get from beating a section are pretty mediocre.Not to mention backflips, jump attacks and sidehops, which are all jumps he does in every 3D game.I liked Metroid Prime a lot too.  
Not really absolute top for me, but really that's more cause of the genre and feel of the game.  

If I'd have to rate them after how "good" they were made "objectivly" though, I'd rate it very high.Ah, nice, thank you for the information :)I personally wouldn't consider Banjo better known/more hype/more wow-factor than Cloud on a fandom-wide scale though.  
Nah man, the hunter is Duck hunt's Stand.  
And you can't see or hurt a stand without having one yourself.&gt;
There are quite a few instances of situational dialogue like this: try talking to the Daily Riches guy while wearing the Dapper Spin Outfit, or to the guy in the Photo Bro's house while wearing the Hammer Suit, or to the Faux Hero while wearing the Timeless Tunic and Tri-Suit. I love this stuff; it makes me feel like I'm playing Majora's Mask again.  

There is also the cheerleader outfit and the shopping guy  
And the cheetah outfit lets you talk to cats.  
Light armor allows you to read the inside of the shopkeeper's tent  
etc...That could be interesting, yeah.  jep.That depends on which continuity we take.  

If we follow anime logic, than Mewtwo can essentially feel the presence of and play around with everyone in a immense radius.  
he was able to pick up his entire clone army at the end of the movie.  

However, op said no anime.  

So then, do we listen to the pokedex, which says stupi shit like Macargo is twice as hot as the FUCKING SUN!  
And ghaslty can kill elephans by just existing near them, etc...  

Or do we look at what we see them do canonically.  
Mewtwo is strong, and with his mega forms, he became the strongest pokemon again stat wise, albeit mega ray. took that over again.  

But at the same time, every pokemon can realistically beat any other pokemon.  
And humans in the pokemon continuity are also never seen being actually hurt by pokemon beyond being pushed around/back a little.  

So... what does that mean for their damage output.  
It's easy to say "mewtwo is a god amongst pokemon", but if all pokemon are incapable of harming humans... then what does that actually mean.  

.

that said, I think mewtwo is definitly top tier.  
He has a bunch of elements under his belt, physical an d psychic moves etc...  
There is a reason he was based on Giygas afterall.Would any of those really be considered bigger than Cloud though ?  
For the average gamer.   Best thing would be if they took some of the extra stuff away from them as well.  
For example the windwaker moveset could go to someone else (Tetra, Toon Link or Daphness).  

Sadly, not gonna happen until the next game.Got a link for that?Nothing like going through the entire thing only to reach the inn and see you forgot to show her the pendant....could eb the basis, but I doubt they won't severaly overdesign it like most other tier 3 weapons.  
Cause, there are very little weapons that are actually based on canon stuff on tier 3Well, typcial zelda games atleast.  
TFH and the FS structure to me seems like a good thing to have some DLC sprinkled over, as the newest update was really well done in general.  

Although, I think regular Zelda games could get DLC in a "different" way from the DLC norm.  
Essentially, have smaller side stories as sort of "expandsion pack/story"  
Maybe even just something like what Majora's Mask was for OoT, but then made with the engine of that game, and instead of releasing it as a seperate game, release it as an expansion pack (and a seperate game too, Like New super Luigi U)One way the fire emblem amiibo in S.T.E.A.M. would have been better is if you could unlock them by finishing some very hard extra mission or reaching a high amount of money, etc...  

Essentially make them grind-unlocks, and make it so the amiibo instantly unlock them.  

That's what they are gonna do with the shadow Mewtwo card.Personally I'd say : "Personally, I'm not ok with the amiibo bullshit in Splatoon at all, but I wont lose sleep over it because it is just splatoon"That is exactly he issue, it's Nintendo sticking one foot out over the slippery slope.  
We don't want them too fall.&gt;It's a couple of missions. Are you telling me your games are incomplete to the extent to where you feel, when you finished Splatoon, that you were missing a bunch of stuff?  

I did, cause Splatoon single player already feels super limited and incomplete to begin with.  
The fact that one of the best ways to add replayability too the levels : do them with different weapons, is locked behind plastic is appaling.  
Especially considering the way the squid amiibo was limited to three packs or bundles originally.  

&gt;
Maybe it's because I'm getting older and while my money for this stuff is getting greater, my time for every nook and cranny of each game I own is lessening that I honestly don't care.  

and that is why game companies are bending gamers over and taking them to frisko town.  
Because people just wave their arm and don't care.  

&gt;But at the end of the day, a Reddit discussion is nothing. If you wanna really actually act on it, stop buying Amiibo and the games that lock these essential video game experiences.  

that is exactly what Serb is saying, yes.  
But just cause he would do it when the time comes, doesn't mean we can't talk about why.Keep fighting the good fight buddy, I'm with you.That's the issue/danger with taking the NFC toys to life thing away from how the "safe" players do it, yes.FUCK YOU SNAPPLE!  

^^^^^I&lt;3UI was actually surprised TFH didn't have amiibo support.  You can use special villagers, but you need the card version for it.True, the New Super Luigi way of doing it would work then.  
Make a second game with the same engine, that can also be bought seperatly.  Just Level 4 of Ruins and Dunes.  
Just like you unlocked every other area so far.  

Every time you beat all the bosses of the available areas ( level 4 - room 4) you unlock the next area.Definitly top tier.  
That guy is whack.  

Never would have expected it originally, but when his stats skyrocket HOLY MOLY is that dude buff.His dancing reminds me of"where in the world is Matt"?I just loved how the multiplayer category was 3 gritty serious shooters, paintball the game and Car soccer.Same for splatoon.  
it's fun and all, but...If someone said : "Splatoon s utter shit why did it win it shouldn't even be nominated, fuck the babies that play that game" would you find that just a normal opinion and the correct way to throw said opinion out there?  

Cause Reggie is there, and it is more of a western show than a japanese one.Toon Link or Daphness would make more sense.  
tetra would make just as much sense as zelda
Just about any 2D plaftormer character with a bunch of melee and item moves fits perfectly in smash.It's a reference to a youtuber.hey you guys got Shovel knight the game way sooner than us.  
So it's not like this is that unfair.Well, saying the opinion in that way is an ignorant thing to say to adirtyhobo59  
&gt;Even though these characters have a similar appearance to the version of them that appeared in Ocarina, they express something different **in a different world**.  Not everyone looks for that.  
nor would I say splatoon is that deep itself.  

Nor nor would I say a game would have to be "deep" in order to be the best.  
KISSYou wouldn't survive.Tecmo is the one publishing it in Japan IIRC.  Proud of Geoff for doing it.  
Profesionally stated, yet clearly showing the disdain for the decision.  

Fuck konami.It's now or never  
Final reveal me neitherThat is assuming they have access to them.The dream is deadMade by the thunder dragon bruh, you know he has the good shit.TFH is not a spin off.  
It is a main series game.  

it doesn't however, include a hylian shield.depends on the context.  
Opinions aren't the untouchable hallmarks people think they are.  
Some opinions can be wrong, especially when stated as facts like the top of this chain did.The dream is dead.Well if those people are goldfish, you at the very least can't read.  
they never announced a direct.fair enough, but it aint.&gt; Can I get a source on that one? I don't recall that happening

End of super mario galaxy  
he falls into a collapsing star, comes out just fine, except with a light headache.  
Bowser has never died, he is just knocked out at the most.  

&gt;Originally, the fire emblem cast was a lot lower, but Fire Emblem fans started taking note how low they were. I wish I could debate with you, but if you know enough about Fire Emblem to tell me why they are fairly weak, I'd be happy to listen  

they are swordman, really good ones, but swordman all the same.  
Robin has projectile based magic. 
Little more than that.  

Any amazing feat like kill demons, gods or dragons are done after being specifically blessed to deal with it or getting a sword or something that is made for the express purpose of kicking the big evil's ass, and even then they do it with an entire army of people supporting them.  

All fire emblem main characters their True strength comes from working together and getting people to trust in them/belief in them and join their ranks, not actual combat strength.

&gt;He's got the masks from Major's Mask. He can temporarily turn into a God.

Fiece deity is not a god.  
And even if he is, a "god/deity" in LoZ means nothing, they get wrecked every other second.  
The fucking light spirirts get wrecked by a single hand movement by zant.  
Only thing a deity in zelda series means is that they are immortal age-wise and have some sort of connection to nature or whatever.  

Either way, FD is not at all "god level" of anything.  

&gt;The Kid Icarus cast is also something I am not too familiar with. No one seems to have questioned Palutena except for you. Can you explain?  

The entire game people take note of how palutena's job is to protet the world and humanity, and the entire game long all she does is give Pit flight, support him with info and teleport him around.  
When you fight her, she is the weakest boss in the game, even a human with a giant sword is stronger.  
Even when the god of the forge, who is capable of creating copies of any being and make a stronger version of it makes a pseudo-palutena, it is a weak boss.  

Pit is the one doing everything the entire game.  
palutena has a single "confirmed kill" on her own, and that is a little side-thing if you take longer than even the most horrible of players would take on a specific boss, and even then all she does is knock it into his next stage.  

Palutena herself notes that she isn't that good at what she is supposed to do.  

also : Hades &gt; Palutena  
Pit defeated Hades and palutena.  

If we are counting all equipment, he also has the great sacred treasure, which is something so strong, you'd need the likes of endgame W101 or broken beyond reasoning stuff to counter it.  

In general, the reasoning of : "well they are a god" is idiotic, and should never be taken serious for Nintendo games.  
Being a god means shit all in every Nintendo game, ussually, at most it means you live a long ass time and you can give support magic to the hero or something.  

.  

About kirby : IMO, you shouldn't use a mini game as a show of actual strength, if he never shows anything even near to it during actual gameplay.  
And even with all his powers, his is a beachball with some weak elemental powers, who is slow as fuck, and takes damage from a guy sweeping close to him just the same.  

Kirby would  be  superstrong if he was smashbros sized compared to the rest, but on his canon size ?  
he is barely midtier.&gt;Ganondorf,   

ganondorf has died like 4~5 times already, what are you on about.  
Pokemon also die in the canon, just never in the regulation-based pokemon battles.  
There is a graveyard for crying out loud.

&gt;However, the supernova thing does require a bit more to look into. The thing with Bowser is that he clearly has a poor match-up with the Mario Bros, so to put him higher then them would require him to be able to beat the opponents above them.  

those are gameplay mechanics at best though.   
besides, if a character has the defense, power and utility to beat 95% of the cast, but can't beat M&amp;L because of "series bias" that would still make him super high tier.  

Not to mention we aren't even talking about skyscraper Bowser.he is already doing so either way.  

what you need to remember, is that this is written down by an article writer from the native langauge through a translator after a question he has a little time to think about in his head.  

Meanwhile, HH was written out with the Zelda top all talking it over, and written for a prolonged area of time, and translated for the explicit purpose of being a canon source.  

.

you can choose whatever you want, but I know what I'm believing between those two scenarios.  

I choose the thing that is repeated time and time again, and has ingame reasoning supporting it.That's not as deadly as Tio rolling over you in her sleep.  

if anything, the fact she is around you means that  she will move you along with her.  
Remember that this is a species that has evolved with human male physiology in mind.He isn't invulnerable at all, in fact, he is pretty weak, as he hurt his own hand punching someone.  

He just doesn't die from anything.  
It is immediatly after ALBW, it is the same Link.&gt; recognize the same Triforce

No they don't  
Termina has no mention of the triforce nor the golden goddesses in general.

&gt;
And despite all of that the book still has a lot of typographical and factual errors within it, so it's clearly not beyond any mistakes that may have also occurred in this interview.  

like ?  

and if anything, that just means that a source that changes his way of saying it every other month depending on how someone asks him about it is even less likely to not mess up at times.A robot can still have a "human" personality if we assume super advanced AI.  
it could even go into the concept of what makes a human "human"&gt;
They don't say the word, but the Hyrulean Triforce is carved into many statues in Ikana.  

Nope, not anymore.  

yeah, cause a robot can't have cool abilities... ... ...  

also, we have seen a tree, a road/leaves and so forth have stands before, so you don't need to be a human/animal to have a stand.  

not to mention the concept of a stand that survives his owner's death that is a robot, etc...  

I mean, I don't want this, but trying to put logic rules onto Jojo's BIZARRE adventure isn't that smart imo.What ?  
I'm serious, there is no triforces on those floaty tongue things in MM:3D anymore.  &gt; As far as I'm aware, Ganondorf has only died twice. Once Wind Waker, and once in Twilight Princess. All other times he was sealed away, and not necessarily killed.

Alttp, oracles, Zelda I (Assuming we are counting Ganon) 
He is resurrected in Oracles and ALBW(not freed/summoned RESURECTED which implies death) and in zelda II, his armies are trying to get Link's blood for the explicit purpose of bringing Ganon back.  
And if you count Yuganon, then he also dies during ALBW.  

The only times Ganondorf got sealed are : End of OoT, both in child timeline (twilight realm) and adult timeline (sacred realm), pre-story in WW and allttp (although they don't seal him as much as that they seal the way back to the light world) and FSA.   

&gt; even the rulers of Time and Space,  

well i am already against the concept of giving the titles of the pokemon any logical weight without proof for it, but ok.  

&gt;Bowser does have ridiculous defense, very solid power, but I don't see his utility that you claim. A lot of his utility comes from the army and devices he has. At his raw form, Bowser breaths fire, throws hammers, rolls around, jumps, and punches.  

and has Magic, can teleport, can transform, can grow in size, create shockwaves,, can roll around as a perfect spiked ball/summon rocks around him, and depending on your way of rationalizing Bowser's inside story, has suction powers that could rival Kirby and Dedede and can summon minions squads to do combo attacks with  

Frankly, that is more stuff than several of your top tiers are ever shown doing.  

&gt;
But you keep mentioning "Skyscraper Bowser." Which game is this from? Maybe I'm just missing something.  

any game where Bowser turns gigantic.  
Sunshine, Galaxy 2 and BiS especially.  
BiS even shows us how it works.  

&gt;
I really wish I could just take your word on it, as I always thought the Fire Emblem cast was too high. But there has been dozens of people claiming that this spot was where they belong. I probably won't change it this time around, but believe me, I'll keep this in mind if I feel the need to post this again.  

what was their reasoning ?  
"ike defeated a god before" ?  
Cause he did that (to HALF of a god) while blessed with the other half of the god, using a sword double blessed to defeat gods with, with the help of all the kings of several beast races which were ALSO blessed by the other half of the god, and in the end the thing that "finishes" the god is the other half of the god channeling itself through the sword.  

it isn't actually Ike that kills the god himself.  

Robin would be pretty high if we took grima-controlled Robin, but that doesn't seem relevant to me.  
i do agree that Ike and Robin are the highest of the 5.  

&gt;Hmm. Perhaps I have overestimated the strength of Fierce Deity. However, Young Link is still probably the strongest of the Links, if nothing else but his extreme versatility with the masks. That being said, dropping to being just above Link isn't out of the question.  

His masks are decent, but none of them on themselves help that much.  
Deku Link would be suicide against any fire users, zora link's only good things are swimming and a very taxing lightning barier, and Goron Link is strong, but slow to start.  
Swordfighting wise, Twilight Princess Link is much stronger, has experience dealing with gorons and is physically superior.  

Fierce Deity is also a questionable thing in a vs match imo, as the mask is made for the explicit point of taking down Majora and his masked beasts, as it can not even be used outside of those fights.  
And he does give up a shield in exchange.  

Windwaker and Twilight princess Link on the other hand, have the insanity that is : Rupee armor.   
TP Link is somewhat meh as it drains all the time.  
but Windwaker Link can hold 999 rupees and his magic armor only ever drains when he is hit.  
Thus leaving him utterly invincible as long as he has money.  
(shame we don't have Tingle in the playable charts, that would be some fun)  

&gt;
I'm looking to revise this rule, but currently, No Final Smash based assets are allowed.  

Great Sacred Treasure is not his final smash.  

Also, you count Shulk in the  final moment of his game (while the smash version uses the first monado) but not other people their final weapons/versions ? 
That sounds extremely bias to me.  

&gt;Now this is interesting. Either few people on here played Kid Icarus, or those that have really don't care about doing a silly debate like this.
The thing about the "God" thing is that, usually, they are immune to all forms of damage except for Holy Weapons or Dark Magic/Weapons/Attacks. While several characters do have Holy Weapons or Dark Weapons (the entire Fire Emblem and Zelda cast), there are several characters that do not have holy weapons, and thus, would render the match-up unwinnable.
Is this not the case in the Kid Icarus series?  

Only gods that actually fight their own battles are Medusa and Hades.  
Virdi and Palutena have generals to do their work (we don't even see actual in-person viridi in the entire game story-wise, only the little artwork of her when she talks, a hologram/mental projection and the swag walk payment thing)  

That said, as we only ever play as Pit or Dark Pit using angelic/godly weaponery, it is not known whether they take damage from other things.  
We can however kill them with magnus his sword, and Magnus is capable of defeating Pit/angels. Which clearly isn't from being sturdy, as we have seen him hurt all over and with a dislocated shoulder before.  

if anything, it seems he has super regenerative powers or something.  
or maybe since his will is so strong, he is a stand user without knowing it.  
Monster Musume - Jojo crossover when ?!A Nintendo logo amiibo.It's by touching the whatever it's called.  

Things like the creatures in ridley's ~~prison~~ stage and the Birdman are stage specific and they appear even when items are off.That's irrelevant to whether it is a "hazard" or not though.Temple has no hazards.  
yet it isn't legal : explain.    Dunno, that guy from Playstation looks like he is actively shitting his pants every single time I see him on stage.  
during E3, the game awards, everywhere.well the anime also already had a jojo reference after all.Yeah I know, I just meant he has been doing it for some time now AFAIK, and he still hasn't gotten "used" to it now.  

Good on him to keep doing it though.  
I think it is nice to see the top dogs of the companies during moments like E3 and the award show and so forth..if you can't take it, don't deal it out either.Exactly.  
So it is not legal.  

therefor, your statement of 
&gt;Every single stage's problem is simply the fact that You can just die to some gay shit in the background.   

is obviously incorrect.  
Several stages have no hazards or no, as you so eloquently put it, "gay shit in the background" yet they have other problems preventing them from being picked.[What I would like to ask](https://youtu.be/l69BP1uhlMs?t=10m30s)Tingle and ~~Takamaru~~ Dillon.    

Other ones I would go for : Midna (+wolf link), Dark Samus, Magnus, and Takamaru.  
And maybe even Ghirahim.  
Also, Isaac, cause there is no reason to ignore him.  

Pokemon wise...  
Probably no one, but if I had to do someone, Darkrai.Nothing about Gardevoirs design implies furry...  

That would be characters like that bunny that gets ripped stockings when she mega evolves.Getting Vee from the adventures Manga would be pretty cool.Depends, if they are only quick transformations to do singular attacks while still running around as eevee, I think it wouldn't be that hard.  
Bit model-heavy, but still nothing compared to Kirby.Must... resist... urge... to watch...Nothing in your sentences comes over that way.

if it makes you feel better though, I don't care for either of the two either, especially not Majora's little batteryboyAnd Shaq FuIf it is actually "adding" it to the game after release, sure.  

otherwise : Fuck THAT.  
Amiibo should not become keys to disc-locked contentIs big battlefield banned ?  
I guess for comp. it is a bit too big?  
Personally I love it.  
Everyone was laughing at the idea of a stage that was just abigger battlefield, but honestly, I think it became the favorite stage for me and my friends for "serious" battles.cause they don't have any stages of their ownBuy all the defensive badges.  
No other way of lowering dmg AFAIK.Kafkei arrives at the in with his sun mask, but Anju has evacuated with her family.  
So there is nobody in that room waiting for him.[Video](https://youtu.be/qlOoagIGGMY?t=6m35s)Yeah, we all know how good the gamecube did compared to the wii right?It's Pikmin.  
no i between pik and min.Specifically that it is only Link that changed.  
Does the co-op work with plague of shadows?Yeah I know, I got it a little after the update was live :p.  
But the rewards per section are pretty lowball stuff
But IIRC, you need the amiibo to unlock it, and NA gets the amiibo later than EU.

Bruh, you know he goes around the entire world delivering presents in a single day and can fit through a chimney right?  SO?Read comment againWii U has great games too.  
And is still getting more.So can Dunkey just become Smash-centric from now on.   
&gt;Hi, what button do i press for the final smash in the 3DS? thank you  

ugh, don't remind me.  
Every time I click top I question whether I should just purge it when no one is watching. ^^^^^^/s&gt;An fzero   
niche as fuck.  
WiiU won't be getting one of these, because they don't sell.  
I can go the same way following that logic : Gcb has no bayonetta, no Wonderful 101, no splatoon, etc...

Wii U will be getting a Zelda, has gotten 2 remake zeldas, and a zelda spin off.   
has a 3D mario, 2 2D mario's, New IPs, Pikmin, Starfox, a sidescrolling DK game, horror game, Smashbros, Mariokart, GIGANTIC Jrpg, (as well as backwards compt. with the previous console, which gcb didn't have), etc...  

.

Hindsight is 20/20  
Even higher if you only look at what WiiU doesn't have atm specifcally.    
NOTeah, cause the grumps have never had "dark" humor or anything before right?oh damn, fearless in the face of downvotes.  
I can respect that my man.  That is exactly the point in the game I spiralled into chaos in my first playthrough.  

All of a sudden just having these tanky, fast instakillers that spawn zombies while everything before it was just weak ranged attacks...  

Got fucked over.Personally I really liked the Animal Crossing Amiibo Party one.That only happens with the Enemy within I believe, never had tht happen.Whether you agree to his reason for it or not.  
We know why Sakurai isn't putting Ridley in, so yes.  
Just about any other character is more likely.  

Personally I'd say a promotion for Dark Samus or Anthony Higgs might have more chance though.&gt;  frees himself of Demise's influence

He isn't "corrupted" by demise or anything, he IS the reincarnated hatred of Demise.  
"freeing" himself from it would be like Zelda "removing" her bloodlineage.  

&gt; truce between the Gerudo and Hyrule.  

Ganondorf has never represented the Gerudo beyond OoT's child era.I wouldn't mind.  
I would love to see General of Darkness, Onox again.  

But I also wouldn't mind getting more new villains.K. Rool and Cranky are better choices anyway.  

And Lanky is the best choice.That has nothing to do with timeline though, it merely shows that ganondorf is not a human possesed by a demon, he is evil himself.  
He would rather let himself and the entire world crumble before helping Link and Zelda.  

The entire point of ganondorf is to be evil to the bone.  
They are not gonna give him a cliche a fuck, essentially "bowser" situation, in which he plays second fiddle to a greater evil and has to help the good guys cause "oh noes, enemy of enemy is friend"Link is pretty decent to play as in SM4SH I find.  

Samus, not so much.What I always find even weirder to think about, is the fact Link had no bow in 64.Well I don't really belief the WW ending sob story.  

Maybe if any of his actions EVER would even barely match up to it, I would, but they don't.It would be unexpected because it would be random.  

In the same way it would be an unexpected storytwist if Luigi was the big villain in the next mario bros. game, just cause.
As well as fit 10 letters with a king sized bed and refigreators in each/Zelda in SS is way closer if you ask me.Barry didn't even invent burgie either.  

And even \*Dan did not invent either the concept of burgers, nor of putting eyes on things normally not having eyes.  
he merely combined the two.    

\*E : Got the first inventor wrong.

Maybe he needs someone with a PhD to explain it to him... but where would we find such a person?Quite the opposite, they have said several times now they did NOT get a C&amp;D.That's cause people want to have something to blame/be mad at.Only ALBW left ?  
Pretty surprised you played FS, FSA and TFH before that one.In general, I never get it when people make fanart of a character and completely change the design.  
Why make art of that character then if you aren't actually gonna draw them.Yeah, fuck people for not putting the same value into taunts as you do right?Captain Falcon for sure.  
People are so stupid about the Bbrain being a jerk to Ross thing.  
They are friends, colleagues and are doing a comedy show together.  
It's not cause you take everything said to you in your life at face value that they do.  I mean, could you imagine if they made a mission-based co-oop metroid game with 4 generic space troopers ?  
Pfft, yeah right, as if they'd do that.Pretty sure they are forced to do that.They used to always skip everything, including funny dialogue and important information.  
I much rather have this than episodes worth of "what the fuck, why didn't the game tell me anything"IIRC, lvl2 weapons use the element of said weapon as "recommended" and the LVL3 forces you to use the right weapon.Jep, Volga's Dragon spear in the adventure mode is a great example of this happening in all cases.  
If you unlock his lvl3 (which is much easier tor each than 2) you can also start getting LVL2 versions.SM4SH with the AI and single player modes of Brawl  
Done.It already is my favorite console since a little after i got it, and it is also has my favorite library of games on it tbh.For a level 1 unpromoted class, those stats are still amazing though.I would just like the practice machine being harder to clear, but in exchange having every set in it contain atleast 1 super badge thingy.&gt; in a "game" that's not entertaining at all, and honestly I don't even care for the layout of my home menu  

well obvious badge arcade isn't for you then.  We also didn't get a theme bonus for the first 2~3 weeks  
And then the Mariokart one was up for a bit, and now we don't have any again.Youtube comments also reference it because they found it funny.  Midna and Link their relation ship is much less "girldfirend" than Link and Zelda in SS imo.  

Link and Midna are partners in their adventure and Midna relies on Link, but Link and Zelda already have the history of being lifelong friends, Zelda also teases Link, is worried for his future and willing to force him to do stuff if he is being lazy, etc..  

Midna is sassy and later on feels bad about putting Link through his adventure.  
Actually "girlfriend/lover" based, they have very little interactions.How do you main sopo?  
sounds like something you made up to sound special.  
like saying you main Olimar without using any pikmin.  

It's not like there is a way to spawn without the other climber.Nope, all of them are canon.  
FS &amp; TFH their stories have little effect on the overarching story, but that's the same for MM and PH and stuff.Everything in the timeline is considered main series for most people.  
the only differentation we tend to make is between the 2D games and the 5 3D games.Well ok, but YOU said : 
&gt;Now I\u2019ve only got one more game left to play before I\u2019m finally at the end of my long journey to play **through the Zelda series**.  

which to me, and I would assume most people, implies you played all the canon, mainline games.
AKA all the ones that are part of the canon timeline.  

sorry for being confused, but considering all the games you skipped, I'm having a hard time understanding what you mean with "The zelda series" or "Main series"  
Especially since you skipped one third of the games.  

Either way, have fun with ALBW, and I'd assume the eventual Zelda U playthrough.Ok, show me a scene except for the ending scenes that gives a lovers/romantic relationship vibe over a "partners in crime" feel to you.  

Just as an example of the difference between the two, SS is about saving Zelda the entire game long.  
TP is never about actually saving Midna except during Midna's Lament, and even that is partly in order to learn what the next step in your journey will be.  

By who?The hardest part of TP is probably Goron Mines, since you only have 4 hearts and falling in the lava takes away 2Not really, luigi was never the big villain "just cause"eh, figures.  
Honestly, I think over half the people on this sub haven't even played a non-3D zelda through themselves anyway.  

Either way, i don't really care, I was just surprised by the idea that you got through those ones before ending up on ALBW.

PS: have you done xenoblade yet in your smash series playthrough?GloriousThat doesn't mean it has too.  
pretty sure a human could also severaly damage your penis all the same.It being harder to clear is merely a trade off I wouldn't mind in exchange for each set to have atleast one "2 free tries" badge in there

I'm sick of clearing it 3 times and not getting a single red badge from itWell in that case I want them to change that.  Not everyone uses smiley faces negativly just cause apparenty that is how you would use them.&gt;
But your logic, all there is to do in shooters is shoot other players or race around tracks in racing games.  

uh, in the average shooter and racer, that is exactly what you do.  
And not every RPG just has you fighting monsters the entire time and nothing else.  
&gt;&gt;Besides running around and getting items and placing probes, what can I do in this massive world?  

&gt;Fight Monsters  
Place probes  
Collect Items  

.

&gt;Do Missions (Story, affinity, basic, and whatever ones come off the board)    
Play online with friends or complete cwuad missions  
Exploring the large world

Which largely consist of more of the gathering items, fighting monsters or placing probes while running around

&gt; 
Build characters relations via the affinity chart  
Mess with different Divisions, Classes, Soul Voices, Arts, and Skills (I'm pretty sure there are over a billion different combinations between all these)  

Not "in this massive world", it is menu based.  

,

Answer it this way, If you were to dislike, or at the very least not care very much for the combat, in this game, and find the act of walking up to a tree trunk and pressing A to get material to not be very thrilling.  
What other things are there to do in this game.WiiU :  Hyrule Warriors (currently playing, other wise it would be SM4SH)   
new 3ds : LoZ : Tri Force Heroes   
3DS XL : Nothing, last was Animal Crossing New Leaf   
3DS : Pokemon Y  
DSiXL : LoZ : Spirit Tracks (friend is using it to play spirit tracks cause his 3DS mic wasn't working right)   
DS lite : Pokemon Soul Silver and Pokemon Ruby   
Wii : LoZ : Four Swords Adventure   
GBA : Yu-gi-oh : Dungeon Dice Monsters  
GBA-SP : Mario &amp; Luigi : Superstar Saga
GCN : Kirby Air Ride or Pokemon Colloseum  
Gameboy color 1 : Oracle of Seasons  
Gameboy color 2 : Pokemon Yellow  
N64 : Pokemon Snap   

Bonus :  
Sega Mega Drive : Wonderboy in Monster World.
Bad translations is deifnitly the main reason.  
Lots of dropped powers for the main character is also one I think.  

Personally I also found Giorno's ... "motivation" to be the least interesting.  
Main enemy's power also felt way less interesting to me,and it had some really random stuff to it.  
The "supposed" power is clear, but then it also has Epitaph and people punching their future/past selves or whatever.  

In general, Diavolo just didn't come over as awesome as DIO or Kira did.   

.

also, directly pointed towards :  
&gt;\&gt;because I love that part so much  
\&gt;and she's my favorite character).  
\&gt; I mean, If I read it like that and its one of my favorite parts...   
\&gt; I just love that part so much it makes me angry.   

People just like different things dude.  
You sorta have to learn to deal with that.  

Personally I thought Mandom was one of the worst arcs in part 7 or even the series, but apparently a lot of people really liked that one.
That is irrelvant to his point though.  
The question is : beyond that, what is there to do.  

PS: it is ok to just say that the game does indeed have all it's content loaded into its main aspect.  
That isn't necesarily a bad thing for most players.  

but the point is valid all the same.Fawfull comes back after he spend his time in PiT gaining money to enact his plan.  
And there is an optional boss which is 3 Shroobs in BiS.  
Exactly, so then why are you trying to act like the other guy's statements weren't correct.Boss battles.  
Honestly, I wouldn't mind never having subspace again (even though I loved it) or even any other "adventure" mode if it meant getting a Boss battle mode each time, with new bosses added in.  The fact you think so is already proof enough that you aren't"wasting people's time", yeah cause we are all forced to watch right?  
If anything, them "pumping" something out you aren't interested in means they are wasting less of your time, as you have no reason to watch it.Sadly, no Pigs in DLC as far as I know.Doubt it, it is just taking a break, like a lot of long series do now and then.Don't insult retarded people Noi.If someone ever makes a grump RPG, "The Beast Cutter" should be Danny's ultimate weapon.Honestly, I'm disspointed in you, and everyone that saw this comment but didn't reply, that nobody noticed I wrongfully credited Arin as the Burgie inventer instead of Dan.I doubt it, I think, Undertale is gonna be one of those games that won't be remembered/talked about by most people in about ~3 years.The babies never foiled anything, he was just a badge shop in PiT.  

I believe it is mentioned that he worked in a shop to gain money, but I'm not sure.  
GoodCome play me in Double Dash and I will.  
Anyone calling themselves the best should know Double Dash is the best game in the series.Pfft, if you weren't able to convince them sooner, you either weren't trying hard enough, or they weren't True friends /s&gt;Have you played the game? its done a lot worthy of being remembered. Like how a single man developed what is the most critically acclaimed original PC game of 2015, and most positively reviewed steam game of 2015.  

Which is impressive, but entirely irrelevant to whether it is remembered or not.  

&gt;Without going into spoilers, its very strong characters, incredibly deep open ended story, fantastic writing and attention to detail, secrets still being uncovered, and newly blooming mod/fan game community will keep the game alive for a long time.  

Thing is, what the game TRULLY depends on.
Is not the story or characters, those definitly help and are great, but what really creams people over and reels them in. . ., Is the "meta-humor"  
With Toby making the game crash when he wants, making it remember stuff you reseted, making jokes based on what he KNOWS the average gamer will be thinking/doing/feeling at that point.  
As well as the immense amount of meme-bait which launched the game to the forefront of tumblr and parody's for weeks and months and stuff..  

However, all of that only works once.  
After you are surprised by the Tile puzzle becoming a parfect pathway or having to suddenly do it the second time, or after the first time the flower remarks on how you reset the world in order to undo something you did, that will never trully surprise you again.  

This means the main draw in off the game has a finite amount of moments to rekindle the flame.  

This isn't the first game like itself you know.  
They all fall down after all, cause without immense replayability or a series/dlc to continue and flare up the debate/love once again...  
Games rarely become remembered for long.  

(And that's not even mentioning the fact the "hardcore" fans are even more obnoxious than the people doing flamewars over which game they like more on here.)

Personally I hope it stay remembered longer, if only to see Megolovania used more.  
But without a (spiritual) sequel or expansion pack, I doubt it will trully be remembered by gamin at large in about 2~3 years.I think it is good enough to deserve that in several ways.  
I just don't think it will happen based on situation and the past.What are you talking about man.  
Saving the kids in the Pusnmo series is the epitome of storytelling.  
I always get anxious whenever I can't reach one of those guys !Just showing the paper mario one would have been better man.That and the sniper warnings.  Eh, the (little of the) overworld we have seen so far seems better in Zelda u.  

For one, I sure wouldn't want the "continents" to be split up so they are only all connected through a single area.Joshu falling into the drain.  
Cause that would mean everything else is already animated :DProbably cause there is no explanation to anyone who doesn't know the details of the character.I was talking about it being made by a single man.Female SnoruntNever said that.  
Although I'm pretty sure that if someone posted a joke image here, and the joke wasn't obvious to anyone/the op didn't explain himself, that it would get downvoted here all the same.Well then you clearly can't be the best in the world.If anything, Minecraft sorta caused the new Indie boom, even if it did bring along quite a lot of "early access" bullshit.I said the same about Cloud, so who really knows.Nobody knows.Don't make Zelda helpless after a side B in the air.  
It's fucking stupid. &gt;and the Pikmin guys drowning,  

The pikmin themselves (except for blue) sure, but the captains can't drown cause they don't need to breath the air around them, their space suit gives them their air.&gt;
Because if we really need an indie rep, Quote makes sense.  

.

&gt;
So basically, no Shovel Knight or Shantae please :(  

I think this is just your bias.  
None of these characters is any more deserving than any of the others.  

and :  
&gt;I just feel as though they wouldn't be a good fit for Smash tbh  

I don't see how quote fits any more into smash than the other two.  
While that is fair, it is a bit strange to change it for a remake while you are essentially making the remake for the fans of the original game.  

This seems to me like if they would remake OoT and decided to turn it into a top down zelda While that is fair, it is a bit strange to change it for a remake while you are essentially making the remake for the fans of the original game.  

This seems to me like if they would remake OoT and decided to turn it into a top down zelda &gt;
It actually does make sense to me. Today's audiences likely won't warm up to the turn-based style on something like a PS4. Keep in mind not everyone who plays this remake will have played the original.

those people are playing the game in order to get a feel for the original though, or at the very least, that's what a remake is suppsoed to do for most people.  

&gt;
The Kingdom Hearts style's more action-packed and more satisfying IMO. In RPGs like Earthbound or OFF, I'm always mashing the button begging for my next turn to come. I'd rather use the Buster Sword rather than tell Cloud who to use it on and what technique to use. (Undertale's an exception as it has a skip button, meaning dialogue I've already read can be skipped, and the bullet hells mean I'm actually doing something while my enemy's having their turn.)  
EDIT: I also find traditional RPG battles a little repetitive as well. 
 
That is all very good and shit, but that doesn't change the reason why a lot of people would prefer the remake to actually be like the original game.  

I mean, personally I don't give a shit cause I think any final fantasy with a number behind it is not final fanstasy, but I can see why people would prefer it to have been like the actual original game.&gt;
See, this is what I was getting at, and why I was so defensive.  

why? cause you can't handle people having a different opinion ?  
Sorry for not seeing what you are seeing.  
Except I'm not actually sorry.  

&gt;Shovel Knight and Shantae don't deserve to be in Smash 4 because Shovel Knight is a one hit wonder as of now and Shantae is a third-party indie character who only has ONE GBC game to cling onto now for "Nintendo relevancy".  

Doesn't quote only has a single game as well ?... and his game isn't Nintendo exclusive unlike Shantea's first 3  

I don't even like the idea of Shantea or Shovel knight's inclusion, bur I really don't see how Quote, who has only ever had Cave story and remakes of said game is any more deserving than the "one hit wonder" shovel knight or the one that actually was Nintendo-exclusive until the announcement of her future game.  

I mean, atleast both Shovel Knight and Shantea originated on the Nintendo consoles.  
Quote originated as an online pc game.

I don't even care for the idea of "competitve balance" or buffs or nerfs or anything, I just don't see how Zelda still becomes helpess for a (not even that great) non-recovery move after 3 fucking games.  

Not to mention they actually made it worse by doing the same for the Phantom (I think?)You know what, fine.  
I'll leave this one up, just so people stop making threads about this.I was deleting them all cause they aren't Smash bros related.  
Something "not being smashbros" is not related to smashbros.  
Probably should have put your timestamp closer to the actual moment.  
Your link goes to 49:12 which means people have to watch for 6 minutes before they see what you are talking about.&gt; Maybe Square Enix has a different idea?? Maybe they want the remake to retain the story, but feel the gameplay could use a few changes.

and that's all nice and all, but that won't magically make those other people not feel dissapointed now will it? 

Probably cause he is the only scrapped veteran they have 0 plans on bringing back.what does steve have to do with Minecraft ?  
Did you mean "Steve?" ?He also has a bow, flint and steel, tnt, an axe, a pickaxe, a shovel, a fishing rod, Buckets with lava, etc...  

Minecraft has a lot more stuff than just a sword and his fists mate.  &gt;
Jigglypuff has no fingers and it (She?) can still grab  

Not to mention Little Mac grabbing people with boxing gloves on.  

&gt;
90% of the cast couldn't double jump until Smash

A big part of the cast can't even Jump at all.  Give me one good reason why they wouldn't.  

Several characters use a bunch of different stuff for their normal attacks.  
Give it up dude, we have had characters with way less moveset potential make it into the game just fine.  
Duck Hunt is just a dog that laughs, Captain Falcon is just a racer, Fox Mccloud flies in a ship, etc...  

Minecraft has more stuff to make a moveset out then some entire series that are in smash combined.Shame the match timer didn't actually freeze.  I removed this as it has nothing to do with smash bros.B&amp;K is dead mate.  
even if they made another game, just placing it on the WiiU won't suddenly make it a good game.Off tv play is already confirmed.I was just being coy/sarcastic.  

I actually don't care about FF being different, and am looking forward to the game, or at least to getting more information on the game somewhere in the future.  
I think sticking to the exact same "situation" is something Nintendo rarely does for its series, and something they shouldn't do just to keep a fanbase happy that frankly is never happy.
 [Deleted]TBF, nostalgia is a much better indication of a game's worth than recency bias.  
I mean, capture the internet's attention for a couple weeks/months is one thing, doing so strong enough that even after 10+ years people still love the game is a lot more impressive.Can't be herobrine, they have removed him like 50+ times by now.[Removed]This one thread is already too many.  
It's not about smash, it's about it "not being smash"  

Only reason I'm letting this one up is so people don't think they are the first special little snowflake to think about posting in here how the announcement which was never implied to be about SM4SH is seemingly not about SM4SH. (shocker)I used to play Minecraft back in the day.  
never much cared for the herobrine "meme", I loved the way Mojang handled it though.Yes, but your thread was about that moment, not about the game.Cause some people love classic RPG's and it is a quickly dying breed lately. 
TO have one of the most well loved ones turn away from its own genre/playstyle is probably very annoying for people that prefer that gameplay.Understanable, people kept bringing it up like it was a big part of the game or something stupid.  &gt;a precious mod,  

are you new here ?  

&gt;I'm sorry, but this comment made me picture you as a big gaping asshole sitting at a computer.   

that seems about right.

Edit : 
&gt;I'm sorry, but  

Don't lie, you aren't sorry.ah, then that was not a thread I was talking about.I want to race, but only on the best Mariokart.It's the truth.  
Only way it might be different is if they handed the IP to a developper that knows how to handle it.  
But that has nothing to do with placing it on a Nintendo platform.I think you are just getting downvoted mostly for already complaining about downvoting before even posting the comment.  

Wow, wow wow dude...  
Kirby is hardcore as fuck.  
He eats innocent creatures and steals their soul.  
he destroys eldritch monsters  
And he is PINK, the manliest clor.But hax... the disrespect !  
Thinking about poor Sakurai, how will he survive not having your money to complete his huge paycheck !nah, Kirby just ate the oI'm merely asking your reasoning behind your opinion.  
You are free to want/hope/think whatever you want.  

Stop thinking everything is an attack on your opinion just cause people are asking/showing other viewpoints.  

PS: this is /r/smashbros, not boards.  

In what way is there no reasoning ?  
I am explicitly asking you what your reasoning behind your statements are.  
It's not cause people aren't blindly saying : "yeah you are right" that they aren't trying to reason with you.  

I think you replied to the wrong person or something.The west is a bigger market for almost anything, and yet the japanese Nintendo branches have always tried to cater to the japanese more than to the West.  

Not to mention Sakurai and the development team is still based in Japan.Little Mac was already in brawl as an AT though, and is first party.  

He wasn't a "newcomer" as much as that he was a promotion.Wii Fit Trainer is S tier in everything mate.Assist tropies and pokeballs would be banned simply because there is no toggle to choose which to keep and which to remove.  
And some ATs and Poekballs are just insane compared to others.  

Well yeah, but I think we were implying in the source material.  

that said, Jigglypuff can kill the god of his world and can create a toxic substance.  Let's think back here.  
Can you think of ANY character that has been requested more in the west than in the East that was added except Little mac ?  

Fire Emblem was exclusively added for Japan, as was Lucas.  
Jiggly is in because Japan loved her that much back then.  

Meanwhile, K. Rool, isaac and Ridley, which are all much more western picks, have not been added.  
etc...  

I do think they look at worldwide appeal first and foremost, but I do think it goes : Worldwide &gt; Japan &gt; WestWhy would Nintendo do that though?  
It's not like they don't have a shit ton of IP's to nurture themselves.  
&gt;And Shantae has ONE Nintendo exclusive game. ONE.  

Still more than Quote has.  

&gt;
Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse have long since been multi-plats, so yeah, come on, bruh :(  

my bad didn't know that.  

&gt;Also you do realize you're acting like the textbook Shantae and Shovel Knight fan I hate, right? Because those people are honestly disgusting individuals.

People are disgusting cause they don't agree with you ?  
Grow up.  
And I don't like the idea of Shovel knight or Shantea any more than you, I just don't see why Quote is any better.  

&gt;Fuck /r/smashbros. This shit is proof that I don't like posting here besides threads that catch my eye. The userbase is legitimately too cancerous to have any serious discussion with, I'm sorry. /r/crazyhand is way better for my needs anyways tbh  

This is were you are wrong.  
The "userbase" has nothing to do with it.  
you just don't want to have serious discussion, you assume anything that isn't in direct support of you is wrong, and trying to insult you.  
then when you can't come up with anything good anymore, you [snap out](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3vryq3/your_predictions_on_todays_mystery_announcement/cxqfe2f) at people without rhyme or reason.  

Not to mention start lashing out at whatever you can, like my flair, even though it had nothing to do with the discussion.  

also : 
&gt;People like you honestly piss me off the most, and it takes a lot to do that, so I hope you enjoy getting reported and downvoted for blatant opinion disregardation.  

oh no, my precious comment karma !  
You know I get a thousand times the amount you could ever downvote me for back from just making a stupid pun or joke on some big thread right?, and I have lost dozens of times your total amount of karma to just saying something people didn't agree with.  
Really doesn't interest me one bit.  

Also, reports don't really do anything if you don't make them for legit reasons.  
people not agreeing with whatever you say is not a reportable offense here.  

That said : [See other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3vryq3/your_predictions_on_todays_mystery_announcement/cxqfyc7)Consider this a warning for breaking reddiquete from a mod, /u/BulkyJam.  

If you snap and start acting rude and spouting out insults to anyone else for no reason (or even for "a reason") like you just did in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/3vryq3/your_predictions_on_todays_mystery_announcement/cxqfe2f) comment, then there will be consequences.Eh, I'd rather get a new big stage than NP.  
NP was so empty.  
Temple and Palutena's Temple are pretty filled in, but New Pork city has just nothingness for the entire top left part.I don't ban without reasons.  
You got your warning now, if I don't see you act rude to anyone else from now on, I won't attach any consequences to it, that is all.  

That said, you aren't forced to spend time here you know, you could just leave if you hate it here that much.  True, although at that point, why not make a whole new stage, possible also from Mother.More like, what a lazy bastard.&gt;Because it was a major franchise? It still had plenty of potential, they could've made the third game even larger and with more personality.  

&gt;I know that they have plenty of IP, and there are lots of IP that haven't been touched in years, but who is to decide what is more deserving of some TLC?  

I'd say Nintendo should take care of their own, before trying to fix what happened to series like B&amp;K  

And from a business side, there is no real reason to put resources into B&amp;K which they would only get partial return from, while they have more than enough to work with without any form of constraints put into it.  

If anything, if they really felt like "supporting" something like that, they should support Yooka-Laylee, which is the spiritual successor to B&amp;K, made by the people that made B&amp;K into what it once was.
True.  
But that is logical, only Eldritch horrors can defeat Eldritch horrorsOracles had so much unique stuff.  
3 mounts to "choose" from which determine parts of the world, An entire equipable ring system, lots of unique items, the whole "linking" shabam, Good dungeons and overworld sequences and interesting "main gimmick" mechanics.  

Espeically Seasons, which is the better of the two imo.  
But both are amazing all the same.I wonder if they are actually planning on finishing this game.  
sorta doubt it considering it's length.  

if not : shame though, would have been nice to see them handle the final *boss*Nice, I forgot what the source was.  
this was indeed what I was referencing.I especially liked the teletubby sun.The Bow was also in the first game though.  
And in alttp you needed it to finish Ganon.  

And in OoT the boomerang could not be used by adult link, and the bow was once again needed to beat Ganon(dorf this time).
NO, GRIMBO!JoJa.  It's really only at the start to make sure you know everything.  
After that it is only during the story segments.  
 
The game is a lot better than people might assume originally.  
It has a lot of content, it looks very nice considering it is on the Wii, and everything works great.  
And the story is pretty interesting too.  

It's not really a game for the average "when do I get to shoot stuff" gamer (although you do get a "gun" later down the line) but that is hardly a flaw of the game.Sort of.   
I won't spoil to much, but they are also gonna get a "gun" (well something that shoots "stuff") soon-ish.  
And if you look at the "context clues" in this episode and the last, you might be able to guess what the first "boss" (/major encounter) will be.  
Sorry, it is not cthulhu.  

The game does not have any creatures in it that aren't real, or at the very least "based on real creatures"   
You do have missions to find legendary creatures, like the [Gravedigger](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/endlessocean/images/c/cf/Grave_Keeper.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101010230647), [Gungnir](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/endlessocean/images/5/51/Gungnir_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150503201729) and the ["phantom"](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/endlessocean/images/3/31/10169290_10201787164713307_8481361103368435856_n.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140509044737)  

.

The final boss is [this beauty](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/endlessocean/images/f/f4/Okeanos_Guardian_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150503180951) ***spoilers obviously***  
Which is indeed based on [this animal](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/05/03/video-undefined-1D8A0D1700000578-293_636x358.jpg)Whatever you do, don't sell the perfect fruit yet.  

Just take your time, play a little every day and enjoy.  
Once you feel you have a hang of it, look up how to unlock certain stores/store upgrades and whatnot.  

Definitly no reason to rush early on.rats, what fruit is your native fruit?perfect.  
Want me to give you some perfect oranges again ?

So the way perfect fruit works, is that they sell for much more than regular fruit and even more than non-native fruit.  
BUT you can't grow non-native perfect fruit in your town.  
(they are a little bit higher maintenance, but not by a lot)

So simply said, the prices go. 

**Orange** &lt; **Other fruit** &lt; **Perfect Orange** &lt; Perfect other fruit  

But you are only able to grow the bolded ones.  I bet knowing it is gigantic, like twice the size of your character, won't help a lot either.I bet knowing it is gigantic, like twice the size of your character, won't help a lot with that.I removed this as per rule 2Nah man, that's the final boss obviously.K, guess I was wrong on that, wasn't sure.I would love it, but it won't ever happen if you ask me.  
If even Ghirahm, Tingle and Midna are relegated to assist trophy, then I doubt the noble goron have any more chance.  Some are still wait to strong.  

ALso, legendaries can still appear out of regular pokeballs as well.Whatever the price is they put on it.  

I already accepted my fate to buy any DLC Sakurai decided to put on anyway.I would love this.  
Although it would be a bit of a shame for the fan translation project of Love balloon trip.I would **LOVE** a sequel to Rosie Rupeeland tbh.  
Love Balloon Trip was nice for as far as I could play it, but the gameplay of Rosie Rupeeland was more fun imo.TBF, it was oviously never gonna be anything special.  
The guy that said it (casually, not even officially) is the one responsible for Indie support on the e-shop.&gt; The only two shrouded in mystery are TPHD and TFH. But it is unlikely either one are specifically made to test things for Zelda WiiU.
 
TFH seems to have been because they wanted to try again with the "four sword" formula now that internet is no longer an issue, as well as focus on CO-op more.  

TPHD is just to ride the (way to early) fan demand.  
It's not even the Nintendo team making it.TP:HD, OoT:3D, MM:3D and Hyrule Warriors were all made by different teams.  

&gt;Hyrule Warriors experiments with hordes of enemies, overworld bosses, and higher quality cutscenes  

Hyrule warriors didn't "experiment" with this, it just had it, and Aonuma found it interesting and was looking for what aspects could be used down the line.  

SS already had a horde fight.  
And the cutscenes is just him saying : I was impressed by them, and now I feel like we can't let them outdo us.  

Also, ALBW and TFH are not spin offs.  
They are main-line games.  

It's cause it is cute.  
it makes them look smaller, which makes them looks "helpless", which makes you want to protec them.Not even close to my favorite, but I find it the best out of the M&amp;L games, that's for sure.Probably cause paper Luigi tends to play second fiddle in the paper games anyway, as well as not wanting to have it become to much like the baby versions in Partners in time.  
As well as well because shitting on Luigi is a proud and honored tradition in the M&amp;L games by now.It wasn't even a tweet, he said it on a podcast.Yes it's a good game  
no it isn't for you.Can you quack [?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7sLYNwevDQ)PS: Entei is far from busted, he is probably one of the worst legendaries tbh.FFS NO!Which is super easy to avoid.Let's just hope he is saying this to make the people hoping for her shut up or something.Definitly best Ganondorf, that's for sure.  
Best parts of every one, combined in one badass power-full looking package  
And now that he is gonna get his trident as well... 

glorious.I think is point is just that playing as Zelda would be better than "linkle" or whatever name you give her.The darkest of timelines just revealed itself.The game never told you you were gonna get those things specifically, but it did tell you the king would reward you for doing all the challenge missions.Looks really fun, and what I played of it in demo events was great too.  
Looking forward too it
The character's official name will still be Linkle all the same.Link hasn't been a straight out blank slate avatar since OoT now.  
Each (or most) of them have a personality of their own for quite some time nowThat's a cutscene though.  
THere have been no actual picture of the maps, nor bosses/armies on the WiiU version.Cause MK8 aint no double dash offcourseOlimar in Pikmin 2.  This is like choosing between my mom and dad...so, who wants to guess what the gimmick of the WW map might be ?  

I definitly think we will need to go grab the pearls (item cards) and use them to unlock the triangle isles to then summon the tower of gods, maybe even have a small "final" section in sunken hyrule like with the giants and the moon in the Termina map.  
THis isn't a "female Link" so far though, it's Tecmo's little R63 "Original character, do not steal" addition for no good reason.  

This is like SEGA saying they are keeping Coldsteel in mind for future Sonic games.  If it was an actual female Link that would be way better than this ... abomination, that Linkle is, that's for sure.Link is not a blank slate character, and hasn't been for years now.  
He is mute, but he definitly isn't blank slate/  

also, Linkle is not female Link, it is this horrible abomination between wanting to add female Link, yet also making her a seperate character for no reason.  

If it was an actual female Link, then it wouldn't be that bad.  
Although it should still be up to the main series to "innovate" with characters, not to the spin off game which should be about bringing zelda characters together.  

I don't mind the idea of a female Link (I do think just about any other " 'X' link" would be more interesting, like a Goron Link or something) but Linkle is just idiotic.Link.  
Or a name not at all related to Link  

Choose either.Female Link is one thing.  

The total stupidity that is "Linkle" is a whole new book.Linkle is not a female Link though.  
if it was a female Link, her name would just be Link, and she would be using the same shit as Link, cause there is no reason to differentiate between the two.  

Linkle as a character is what people really dislike, not female Link per say.Cause she is an "ORIGINAL CHARACTER DO NOT STEAL" in a game that is supposed to eb about bringing a bunch of Zelda characters together, while we are still "missing" (or at the very least still have available to us) dozens upon dozens of characters from the main source.I really don't get the reasoning anyone could realistically have behind removing ANY character with a unique moveset, even one they don't care about, while we have fucking Dark Pit and Lucina on the roster.If anything, those two should be alt. costumes and Alph should have been the clone with different stats because of the differences between Pikmin 1&amp;2 (Olimar) and 3 (Alph)Lucina or Dark Pit.  

Obvious reasons, they have no good reason of being in the game as characters.  
if those and Dr.M don't count...   

Being a bit soon, but probably Cloud.  

Edit : or you know what, I'd remove Ganondorf.  
We all know he will be put back in eventually/in a different form, and then maybe he won't be Falcondorf !eh, I was replying to you, tbh.  
he can think whatever he wants, Sakurai isn't gonna remove a fully unqiue moveset without reason.I wouldn't mind a Link that happens to have 2 x chromosones either.  
Although i do think out of all the "variations" you could come up with, it is probably the most boring one...  

Something like a goron link would be way more interesting imo.  
but whatever.  

Linkle is just stupid though.  
If anything, I could see/accept her getting the crossbow training spin off thingy if they ever make a new one, wouldn't be that bad.And you are free to have it that way.  

Won't change that Linkle is just stupid imo, and that there is really no good reason for her existance in the way she is done now.Fair enough.  Every opinion is subjective dude...  
If an opinion was objective, it wouldn't be an opinion, it would be a fact or atleast an educated unbiased guess.  

.

But again, that won't change the fact I doubt anyone could name me a good reason for Linkle's existanceExcept I did say "IMO"  

I also think that a certain basic level of comprehension of the function and utilization of "opinions" in modern day speech is to be expected of other people, if for no other reason than to not show the assumption that others are to stupid to figure it out themselves.  

If you said "This ice cream is good"  
I would not consider that to be you stating it as a fact.  
cause I am not retarded.we don'tNo, I would love if the area designers of MK8 were to design the areas for a future 3D Mario   

However, what I would love even more, is if the next 3D mario had levels more akin to Sunshine ("connected" as opposed to shapes floating in the air or something like that)  
But actually make all the levels part of an "open world" situation.  
With obvious warps to move around.  

Sorta like the way the overworld works in the M&amp;L games, but then with 3D mario platforming and star/shine getting as the objective. Must be my good looks.Wind would definitly make sense.  
possible also warping with Cyclos' cylones. The sudden turn around.  
Just like boogie's channel really.  

Quite fitting.  Only reason you are saying that is cause I am disliking something you like.  

I dislike Linkle, yes.  
You are free to like her (for whatever reason you can come up with)  
but for me, she is an addition with no reason for existing in her current form.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgI-EjRiGckWell, imo.  
A game about bringing together zelda characters is not the right place for doing so for a non-zelda character.No she isn't.  
She is an OC.  

She is just as much a zelda character as Coldsteel the hedgehog is a sonic character.  

Also, to go back to what I said before, those other 4 characters each have an obvious reason for existing in their state.LOL, no she isn't  
she was made by Tecmo Koei.   
She isn't canon in the zelda series until she appears in a canon game.   

She has no connection to "The legend of Zelda"  
Her only appearance is Hyrule Warriors, which is not a canon legend of Zelda game.  
And she was not made by the Nintendo team, not by Mr. Aonuma, not by Mr. Shikata, not by Mr. Miyamoto, etc...  
So she was not made by the people who "write" legend of zelda.

Cause even from what they wanted, linkle is shitty.  

She is essentially even more enforcing the idea of male Link being the standard, and female being the ones getting a consolidary bone thrown to them.  

This is not how you do a female Link.  It does not.  
Aonuma did NOT produce Hyrule Warriors.  

The producers are Yosuke Hayashi and Hisashi Koinuma   
and the director is Masaki Furusawa   

So no, Aonuma, nor any of the big zelda guys did not create hyrule warriors, and especially not Linkle.The Legend of Zelda : The Windwaker Jep.... *sure am*Well, it certainly would be a whole lot better than remaking fucking twilight Princess already.  

Hell, if they remade Zelda I (and II) and maybe changed some things about Ganon's design to resemble a certain art obsessed villain fused too it, I think me and /u/serbaayuu would find that pretty interesting.  

That said, I don't really see it happening.  
Nintendo has already shown that they aren't really interested in remaking 2D zelda games.  
They much rather remake the 3D ones way too soonDude, I agree that she is.  
but making threads like this really doesn't do anything if we are honest.  

I do agree she is a horrible addition. 

.

Personally I am just hanging on to the hope that aonuma just said that to shut people up about her or something.  
or that it is one of those things he said they will keep in mind, but never do anything with it.Dude, I agree that she is.  
but making threads like this really doesn't do anything.  

I do agree she is a horrible addition. 

.

Personally, I'd say that if she actually WAS just a genderswapped Link, same name, same outfit design, same weapons, etc... 
then i actually would have been more *ok* with her.  

But as it stands out, she is a failed half and half female link/oc.Well, I do agree with you.  
She is the worst addition to this game so far.  

And frankly, the only bad addition in any way.I must have not seen Bisque come past the updates on here.  
She looks like she takes inspiration from the Doll in Bloodborne.Yeah right, cause it isn't like Arceus got his shit wrecked by a ten year old.There would be absolute chaos.  &gt; Goku - FUCK THIS HORSESHIT COMPANY I QUIT

I hope he doesn't think that way about my [goku](http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Goku) vote.
\*now entering, the graveyard\*I doubt that is how he meant it.  
but even if it is.  
my point remains.  

a female Link would have been much better than the abomination that is Linkle.Well for one, I don't think we even needed a female Link to begin with anyway.  
but if we "needed" a female Link, then actually make it a female Link.  

Give me one good reason why making a Female Link would involve a new name, different design beyond obvious biological differences and different gear ?  

Linkle is not a female Link, but she is still shackled to the concept of it by her original concept and idioitic name.  

&gt; You'd think they'd be at least a bit happy with what to them should be a "step in the right direction".  

also, from their viewpoint, this isn't a step in the right direction at all.  
For them, this just further cements that Female Link is not the standard and will only exist as secondary.  

most fo those People don't want "female Link" they want "a link that happens to be female"  
Might not seem like it, but there is a big difference ebtween the two.I never said anything about Mario  
However, a big difference between mario and Link is that Mario is a singular entity, while Link is a collection of reincarnations, with nothing straight out stating that Link has to be Male, or even Hylian, in the current canon.  

Therefor, female Mario would be changing a character, while Female Link would merely be adding a female reincarnationg to the list of 10+ Links we already have.  

.

Now on to why Linkle is stupid while just a Linkarnation that happens to have XX chromosones wouldn't be.  

Simple, the entire reasoning behind Link being a female character, is to have "equaility" behind the people playing as Link's experience.  
Or at leats, that is so for people who essentially want to have a choice between the two.  

Linkle however, is not "equality" in any way.  
She isn't Link, she is an "OC do not steal!!!" that is vaguely based on Link, and with a lazy name to boot.  

If this was about actually adding a female Link option so that Female players of the game could feel "connected" or ... *"Linked"* to 'them' more, than both genders would need to bring the same amount of options to the table.  

If we take Link as the male option  
and Linkle as the female option  

Then this means the male option has ~7-8 different weapons and ~8 different costumes from the get go, as well as it being the main character of the main story.    
While the female character has (so far) a single weapon, and is merely the main character of a side story that is unlikely to be much longer than a handfull of chapters.   
Therefor, if the reasoning behind Linkle's existance is in order to "checkbox" equality of the list, than she is a shoddy attempt at that, as she does not actually create any "equal ground".  

If her addition is just about adding a female lead : Hyrule Warriors was really not in need of that, considering the WiiU version actually has more female characters than male, and of the main cast, only Link and G-dorf are males.  
With Zelda(, Sheik), Impa, Lana and Cia all being female character in a position of importance to the plot.  

Also, if we needed more female characters, it stands to reason (imo) that it would be much better for a game about bringing together zelda characters, to pull more female characters from the main zelda series, as opposed to making up a R63 version of Link, and then not even daring to go through with it and make it "Female Link that isn't really Link but is trying to be"  

If this was about making a little sister character, as another article that goes more indebt on the interview has made clear was in fact one of her major design parts originally, then making her an Hyrule Warriors version of Aryll would be much more logical, as that is alreayd an established female character in a sister role.  
Etc...

.

Lemme ask you the other way around.  
In what way, does Linkle do ANYTHING good that wouldn't be outdone by adding an actual Zelda character to the mix, or introducing her in a different light (and with a vastly better name).
I slightly disagree.  
I think FS (which got one) and especially FSA could use a "remake", or at the very least a "port with added options" in the form of online play, in order to allow more people to play the game as intended.Pretty sure this IS the original source, as it is an interview between IGN and Aonuma and HayashiThis interview just baffles me further why they didn't just name her Aryll back when her concept was about beign a little sister character, or anything else now that she is supposedly a "seperate" character.  

Well in reality I know, I just find it pretty sucky they did something so stupid as to name her Linkle just to ride the "hype" of female Link, while she isn't even a female Link.What?  
There is a difference between "existing" and being a (canon) Zelda character.  
No one in their right mind would consider Uncle Rupee a canon zelda character, just the same as Lana, Cia, Wizzro, Volga and *linkle* are not canon zelda characters.  

And no, Aonuma was not part of the development team, he was (and in general is) the supervisor for the legend of zelda series.  
That means he checks up on every use of the franchise, and says whether it is ok to do stuff or not.  
When Sakurai adds LoZ stuff into smashbros, Aonuma, or someone he delegated it too, will check up on said content to make sure it fits into the series' feel.  

That however does not mean they actively are a part in the creative process of the game, and it DEFINITLY doesn't mean :  
&gt; She's literally a canon character created by the people who write the series   While this is a good theory, I think it sorta falls flat for the simple fact that it is not how Araki put it in those books detailing stands and whatnot.I prefer 150 cause the tracks are designed with it in mind.  
I would probably prefer 200 in a future games where the tracks are designed more with the speed/mechanics of 200cc in mind.I meant in one of those books where they show off all the stands. or the little inbetween pages that show off and explain stand powers.  
AFAIK, those have never "lied" before.That's not how canon works dude... like at all.  
hell, Aonuma has already gone on record saying that Hyrule Warriors is not canon.  
it is a non-canon spinoff fan game.  

What's next, are we gonna say King Harkinian is canon?  

Something isn't canon until it is shown in a canon source.  
Hyrule warriors is not a canon source.  
Hence, until Linkle (or the other 4 HW characters) appear in outside of Hyrule Warriors, in a mainline game, they are not canon.  What, no Zelda U ?  
I know it doesn't have a title yet but... seriously?Also, IIRC, the flesh bud thing is said to be a vampire power.Name me any character in marvel that has ONLY appeared in Avengers ever.  

Also, Aonuma's comparison is pretty flawed cause the event of avengers IS canon to the other "stories"  
unlike in Hyrule Warriors and the main zelda timelines.  

Also, it not being canon is exactly the reason why the characters aren't canon, and won't be until they appear in an actually canon game.Still doesn't really explain why Dio thinks timestop specifically is his stand power, while he doesn't link any of those other ones to the world specifically.

Or even why the stand info pages say his power is time stop specifically.  

hell, even when Platinum finally learns timestop, his is renamed too "Star platinum : the world"  
Which strongly implies it is Platinum using the world's power as opposed to the other way around.  

.

if we had only ever see the in-story things happen, this theory holds up somewhat.  
But the fact we get these "out of story" stand explanations, sorta implies those explanations are canon imo.Not hate as much as that he is the least fitting character on the roster for me.From then on she is canon sure.  

until then, she isn't, cause that is what canon fucking means.  
Canon has nothign to do with your opinion, with my opinion, or even the "opinion" of Miyamoto himself.  
Canon is canon.  
And until she is shown in the canon, she isn't canon.  
As soon as she IS shown, she is.  

Really fucking simple.  

that said, even if she becomes canon eventually, that won't change how fucking stupid she is, especially her name, and that she was added in legends for no good reason.Lol, "kiddo"Cause it started off pretty weak.  
in a way, 3DS and WiiU were in the same boat at each of their starts, but 3DS was able to pull free more easily.  
(probably in big part because there is no real big competition on dedicated handheld game system)Or maybe some people just don't like her ? 

geez, nobody cared when people were complaining about Pink Gold peach and baby daisy/rosalina in MK8, which is the exact same situation.I think a lot of people just don't like the fact we are getting an "OC do not steal" character over literally any other canon character from the source material.  

I mean, you can dislike Tingle fo sho, but at the end of the day, he IS a zelda character.  
Same for me and Skull kid, i think he is a pretty stupid character in MM (which is the one people always rave about, TP Skullkid is sweet though) but at the end of the day, he is a zelda character.  

Linkle is this weird amalgamation between trying a female Link, yet also don't actually making a female Link in any actual way.    

I think a lot of people also don't like how everyone is getting their hype up over R63 link here, while ignoring the actual zelda content being added comparitivly.   
Just feels like HW is getting "rewarded" for going the "wrong" (for those people) path.  Definitly, though I think WiiU had a price drop too didn't it?I strongly disagree on that.  
LoZ is not a series you should play if you are looking for "respectable difficulty"  
Even the first 2 are only so because of... questionable... reasoning.&gt;Backwards compatability did not make the wii a hit. The appeal of the waggle gimmick + wii sports to people of all ages, including many non-gamers made the wii a hit. Backwards compatability was an afterthought made possible by the fact nintendo chose to NOT make the wii a graphical powerhouse.

&gt;The wii u has backwards compatability with the wii and it's the worst selling console in nintendo history. So backwards compatability clearly didn't help sales much, did it?  

I never said it did in any way.  
Re-read my comment, you clearly filled in some non-existant blank with your own (funny tasting) words.

&gt;Nintendo hasn't said much about the NX, but they have said repeatedly that it will be an entirely new concept - not exactly a ringing endorsement for backwards compatability.   

the wii was CONSISTENTLY marketted to be "something different" as well, even when it was still "revolution"Hmmm, I was under the impression he praised Link for it, but it seems I was mistaken.  
Although the very fact the tree is now there already creates a paradox on account of that meaning Link has no reason to go back to plant the seed, and thus the tree not being there, and thus Link needing to plant the seed there, and thus the tree being there and thus........  

And the timestones are also still inconsistent on that aspect.[eeeeeeeeeh](https://youtu.be/z2Gue6Um2OE?t=38s)  
I think that is some serious leaps.  
I think it is much more likely that Link fails somewhere during OoT, and that Zelda, or someone/something else, creates the split (probably even unknowingly, as in their timeline it most likely looked like "nothing happened" ) trying to prevent/reverse Link's death.  

Although my reply was over Zelda forgetting who Link is between aLttP and the oracle games.**NINTENDO SEQUELS**

&gt;Wand of Gamelon, Faces of Evil, and Zelda's Adventure. I also wouldn't be too surprised if they are somewhat based on the general idea of "(woodland) fairies" as mildy-evil/annoying tricksters  

That combined with her easily being a bit of a ... "special" case could easily be the reason.Kokiri girl also believes she will die if she leaves the forest (as all kokiri do)  
yet at the end we see them all at the ranch, VERY happy that they will soon all be dead.  

also : 
&gt;All the stalfos in OoT are skeletons, boney and obviously shirtless, that's a terrible argument.   

Exactly, and as the very sexy [Serb](/u/serbaayuu) just pointed out, Hero's Shade is **NOT** boney, and does not look like the TP Stalfos **AT ALL**It could very well be that people in that get lost in the Lost Woods do become Stalfos,   
it's just not a guarentee nor is it clearly the only way that Stalfos are 'born'.  

Although TBH, Based on most of the Stalfos' troughout the series their skeletal structures, I sorta doubt Stalfos' are the remains of humans/hylians anyway.She is probably just a bit of a bitch, as well as possible a bit of "elven snobbishness" 

With which I mean : a race that does not know the fear of death (on account of being age-immortal) will probably look down on species that do as well as not realize what they say is dark/mean/etc... when talking to said races.People just want to feel 'offended/hurt' over this sort of stuff lately.  

If they really cared *that* much about it, they wouldn't have an issue with meeting up with people.  
If this happened before the internet age, they wouldn't even have known about the damn costume.  
and now that they know about every little funny thing they can't easily obtain, they refuse to work towards it.  

Not to mention this costume will probably not even be that great, it will probably have a very *meh* effect or something.Seems very likely.  
In general, the other forms of time travel all seem to create some sort of "tunnel/gate/door/etc..." between the two moments in time.  

While Zelda seemingly just send something back without create a (somewhat lasting) "connection" to said time.They didn't look over it at all.  
That was the entire problem.  

Those were essentially the whole reason that Nintendo has since turned into the *big brother* of trademark licensing.The worst part about Fairy Tail (imo) is that in many moments, you can feel there is so much potential, both in the story and the writer.

&gt;You're missing the point entirely. Not everyone has friends that even own a 3DS. I personally only know two: my husband and his friend. Both of them live in Canada, and I live in the US. What am I supposed to do, walk around and look for people that own a 3DS? Then what, "hey, you wanna play triforce heroes?" Something tells me that's not going to work.   

Ever heard of the internet ?  

We SEE they don't age, or at the very least age VERY slowly (physically) , as they look the same after 7 years.I didn't stop because of rikki, it's just that at that point i was no longer able to force myself.Yeah, and even ignoring dying, he has been "critically injured with no hope of recovery, even if he survives he'll never fight again" just as often, and he is still dregging along.  

(not as retarded as Might Guy's non-death in Naruto though)What ?  
Sorry. but imo, TP skullkid is way more interesting then fucking batterypack useless mm skullkid.  Exactly, and people can't stand the game not being designed 100% around them. cause they are little sensitive babies that need the whole fucking world to revolved around them.  Exactly.  God, please tell me you were half-asleep when writing.  

Do you really not realize what the internet can allow you to do ?  
Fucking arrange a meet-up if you need that last fucking costume so much, FFS.  
This is no different from stuff that you unlock through streetpass, or stuff that you unlock through online while you have no online.  

It's a single extra costume that rewards people for playing local multiplayer.  
And people are pretending like they are locking the entire game away behind a paywall or piramid scheme or whatever.  
Fucking get over yourselves.Why?  
Cause you people think too simplistically to realize the internet can be used for more then browsing reddit and linking your systems too ?  

Set up a meet-up with other people that need the costume if it really matters so much for you, geez.  Just amazed at how ignorant people will pretend to be in order to feel justified in raging over something like this.  
Merely the drop that caused the bucket to spill on this community."best experience"  
As if a single costume is gonna change the experience of playing the game, dear god.So Nintendo should only ever market to the lowest common donominator so that nobody can ever feel like the game isn't catering to their situation correctly ?  thank youOooh dear god.I got that spoiled just in time, and was able to prevent it :3Not really, we all known they came up with that reason after wanting to dress her like that.  

You can still dress her up in clothes, and the person that had her "condition" before it wore full body clothes eitherwayIt's a bit of a shame it removes the chance for 100% completion though.  
I'm hoping for a patch where you can re-capture quiet by simple replaying her 'boss battle' mission.Purple.Not at all.  
Like, even further away then OoT is from S64Maaah right, he said that himself.  
Kojima is a bit like Huey.  
Lying so hard that he believes it himselfVery strange choices.  
Wooly world is already out in most parts of the world, lots of games aren't even mentioned, etc...

Either way, It's Zelda U, and for a game we already know more about : Triforce heroes.  
both ar elooking great.  
Though honestly, I think I'm hyped for the entire list (and most games mentioned in this thread) except for terraria and Xenoblade CXMagic in Fairy Tail is even more loosely explained than stands in Jojo...  Making the same game between old and new "standards" is a lot easier, but generally, non-indie games have become WAY bigger, both in scale and production.  

The teams that are one single PARTS of games these days would have been the entire company before.  &gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Spiny Suffocation is exactly the sort of level you'd expect Arin to make, with the learning curve built-in into the gameplay, and it's clever how you can take two paths. Both of his levels generally felt like Mario levels.

I strongly disagree on them feeling like mario at all.  
mario almost never forces you into awkward jumps/situations like 3-block-sized hallways over infinitly spawning spinies.  

&gt;However, we've mostly seen Ross's levels, and a lot of shit has been talked about Ross's levels. And yet, I don't recall a single level of Ross's that required you take damage to complete it. Both Arin and Jirard's levels do, and I feel that any real stage in gaming SHOULD be reasonably solvable without taking damage, even if that's unlikely.  

On the other hand, Ross also almost never gives you any powerups (his little cheats not considered)They are holding their hands/arms to the side though.  
That is clearly not a [stroheim salute](http://ec2.images-amazon.com/images/I/518i1BnxtXL.jpg)The totem mechanic didn't work as well with 4, and in general : balance/design worked beter with 3Man, /u/serbaayuu is gonna be sad.Cause they didn't buy those phones just to play the games, while you did do that with your portable gaming console.  

I just wished we could get a Four Swords Adventures re-release for WiiU or 3DS (prefer WiiU with 3DS linking, but both would work)oooh god, here we go again.I can sling that way back at you.  
"Creating" a game has become easier, sure.  
but because of that, the minimum level of quality a game needs to have in order to be seen as "good" as gone up.  

Making games has really not become "easier/cheaper/etc..." across the entire line, and the only person overestimating anything here is whoever thinks they did.&gt; almost never

There is a reason this sort of thing is in only a handfull of levels, cause it isn't fun.   
And even so, many of the ones in your example are still not actual limited jumps.  The voiceacting seems a bit awkward, but it looks great otherwise.[Subtly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVAhW4ToLFI)If they so silly, why you guys leeching of their langauge ?"TP wasn't loved"  
Guess that explains how it was the BEST SELLING ZELDA TITLE ever, with only Ocarina of Time re-claiming it **IF** you count the remake/VC sales.    
Also explains how it got almost nothing but positive reviews, etc...  

But, I guess Arin is just going off of the current stand of the Zelda Cycle.  It's not saying anything though, it's just repeating the same vague shit, some of which is even working against each other.  

Ow, so it needs to be simple controller-option-wise, but it also needs to be backwards compatible (and thus allow for all the controllers the WiiU allows)  

Not to mention it is telling Nintendo to just turn the way of the other two and become a weak fake-pc with nothing unique to it.  
Which is the exact opposite of what Nintendo should really do.The main difference in Darksouls is that in Darksouls, the big bosses tend to be the easy parts, and the ganging up of smaller creatures is the hard part.  

In Monster Hunter, the small monsters might as well not be there from a difficulty perspectiveThis was back when Soccer was played right mate, when you didn't avoid tackling someone because of some stupid pansy with a wistle and color-coded cards, but when doing so would mean the entire opposing team would try to give it back to you, on or off the field.Mario games are never "the same" game, each one has made differences.  
Saying they are, would be like saying all platformers are the same game.And most likely that was cause you weren't aware of the Konchu's location, or didn't take measures to stop it.  

Something like a "regular" enemy parrying you and one-shotting you, or a single small enemy stun-locking you to death on its own is something that never happens in Monster Hunter.  
admittingly, in Darksouls it only happens till you git gud (or more realistically, learn that running through/past small enemies is the way to go) but still.His reach,  
and if you don't fall for the cape, he also doesn't have long-range projectiles.  

In general though, his weakness AND strength is in being the all-around.  
He doesn't really excell at anything, but he also doesn't suck at anything either.Peach is a nurse though, not a doctor.It also wouldn't work for SM4SH, cause I assume you mean he would use his transformations, which the 3DS can't handle.If you are gonna be mad at him for commenting that he agrees, then just downvote him instead of yelling.Thank you.He's already in it though, twice even, he does that floating and finger lazers stuff.In what way would Krystal not be realistically unless taking very loosely ?  She is first party Nintendo and part of the main cast of her series.  So I guess you also want them to remove Fox then?There might not have been a FE  that was a "bad game", but Awakening was a "bad FE game" imo.Honestly, I don't get the Paper Mario more then the Inklings.  
Paper Mario is fucking awesome.  Awakenign had less to do with "expectation" in terms of quality, and more about design choices, which will now become the norm because of how many new people Awakening pulled in.Not Mario's series' fault that they have so many awesome characters  
Paper Mario has no representation though.FYI i was being sarcastic.They really don't change enough between each itteration though.  
ussually you have a couple that are pracitcially unchanged, followed by one that changes a lot of stuff, and then being very minor "updates" style new stuff.  

Let's be real here, yes they change, but not nearly enough to be a yearly release.eh, if FE can get 5 characters, i don't see the issue with giving the best Mario side-series an awesome character with a shit-ton of possibility for a moveset.&gt;Thats such a copout, Fire Emblem has a 3 different movesets, a semi clone, and a clone, with tons of moveset potential with many different types of weapon, spears, axes, tomes, so theres no reason to even consider giving paper mario an edge on moveset potential.  

Sorry, but no.   

Not a single character in fire emblem has as much stuff to pull from as paper mario.  
(which is logical, because we are talking about simplified class-based characters as opposed to the single main character of 4 games)  
You could make entire movesets out of just his own moves in 64/TTYD, his partners, the pixels, the party in SPM, ~~a sticker-based one~~, his PJ moves, etc...  

None of the characters in Fire Emblem have anything beyond : "he uses this weapon instead of another" or "they use a horsey, a winged horsey, a scaly winged horsey, or can become a scaly winged horsey" 

Almost all of the fire emblem characters their moves are made up, with only a handfull of their animations beings taken from their actual actions in the game.  

Robin being the exception because he uses all the magics.  

Hector or Ephraim would be the same thing again, their sprited existence merely means they have all of maybe 5 poses/animations to take over, and beyond that, all you have is : "this guy's weapon is different"  
Hell, best part is, for Ike, they didn't even give him his signature move (or more specifically, what is 'signature' about his half of the legendary twin blades) : the ability to fire shockwaves.  

&gt;Mario, Luigi, Peach, bowser, yoshi, rosaluma, bowser jr, and if i would even count both wario and dr. mario within the mario reps.   

Guess what, "Mario series" is also like 5 series in one, and each of them sells  better than the average B-list series does. 

ps: Dr. Mario is indeed a mario rep, but yoshi is a yoshi rep.



[Jow serb](/u/serbaayuu)  
Is it just me, or is it a couple years to soon to start seeing TP praise and SS hate specifically because it isn't tp ?  

Zelda cycle speeding up or something ?The one thing I would like to see for this won't be in it though.  

(darned cut content, I need my iron-head shadow beasts)There is the Serb remake-salt.  
I knew it couldn't be far away :p  

You know what buddy, on this one and WW:HD I agree.  
I could see OoT and MM needing a remake because of how outdated they were, and especially MM was updated really well, but WW and TP really didn't need one yet.  Assuming this will take the path of WW:HD, I'm not that impressed.  
If they really want to remake these games already, they should atleast be adding in some of the cut content or something, but so far, none of the (3d zelda games) remakes, whether they be 3D(s) or HD versions, have done so.  

ALthough i will commend them if they at the very least add in the ironhead shadowbeasts.Haven't they done this for every wii game so far ?all the wii games have been 20 so far AFAIK, with a 50% reduction on release.Ugh, another bunch of wii games I already own coming to the VC Xd  
Man, this is unprecedented.  
I feel like a biologist that is starting to notice the mucking up of the ecosystem by harmfull "alien" species being introduced to it.  

Dunno man, I already though the WW:HD one was strange, but fucking TP which is still 'last gen' accessable ?  
It seems like Pokemon has become their version of an annualized series, and Zelda is gonna become the one with as many remakes/deluxe versions as there are game on their own or something.  

(PS: if we are getting all this remakes anyway, when is Zelda II HD coming ?!? If we are really going down this path, i better get my HD thunderbird)&gt;I was okay with Wind Waker exclusively because they were using it to learn the Wii U, but otherwise it's much worse overall than SD.  

WW is my favorite game ever, but honestly, I think that if they really wanted to remake it that soon, they should have gone the full trip and added in some cut content or something.   
And otherwise it was too soon, but I guess them using it to "learn" the wiiU and then not just throwing away what they got is somewhat of a good reason.  

&gt;I haven't played MM3D and don't intend to but the dumbing down of the Bomber's Notebook etc. is upsetting.  

I don't think making the bomber's note book less confusing/less random on who is written in it is "dumbing it (the game) down"    
And the much better boss battles (and much more details in the world) make THAT one feel like the "definitive" version   
IMO, MM:3D is the best one out of the remakes they have done so far.  

OoT:3D was also good, if only to remove the very obvious aging signs on OoT (and finally slap some... well anything really... onto "hero of time's" emotionless face)  

Honestly, if they really wanted to remake some games...  
There are a bunch of 2D ones that could look amazing with higher detailed sprites or an ALBW/TFH look that are way older than any of the 3D games...Well me neither beyond the first 2 sets, mostly cause I already own all of them anyway... but AFAIK, all of them have been 20, and 10 during the releaseweekMaybe the worst of all : now the news of this *remake* is probably gonna steal away attention/hype from an actual new Zelda game : tri force heroes...&gt;It won't make any difference.    

.

&gt;Made a difference for the Augment Your Preorder campaign.

That still doesn't guarenteed it was "it" (aka people nagging about preorders) that made the difference.It's a great series, now if only they stopped trying to make me play it on a 3ds and went back to screens that are the right size for that sort of game, and then I would be able to get back into the newer versions...None of the shit you mentioned fucking existed back then thoughI doubt all of said content would be re-used that way.  
More likely, they just didn't have those dungeons worked out well enough to re-add them in without any effort.    

Still think WW (and now, TP) didn't need a remake though.why do you put a little star next to trans ?  
It seems like you were gonna put a definition below your comment but forgot or something.And why do you expect this bigger, "arts and crafts filled" sub to be better?  

only issue with /r/Truezelda is that the mods aren't very active, meaning posts that should be removed instantly stay up for days.&gt;On a side note, where's all the love for the 2D games? There is more to Zelda than TP, WW and MM!  

Tell that to Nintendo and Koei before saying it to the fans.&gt; I think that this sub needs to give more love to the 2D games because they are incredibly fun.

Nintendo (and their team-ups) should give more love to the 2D zeldas in general.  
Tell me, how many fighters based on 2D games are in Hyrule warriors ?  
how many fighters or assists based on 2D games are in Smash?  
How many of the 2D games got remakes ?  
etc...Maybe he hates it cause it isn't glorious double dash, which is obviously still the undefeated king of mariokart games.No one is talking about that though.  
All that was being said is that 'it' won't make a difference, and then someone else said it did, even though there is no way to proof it was cause of the nagging (unlikely) or cause of it just being a whole new level of bullshit.  

Either way, pre-ordering should still be a choice.  
What really should be discouraged is complaining about you having preordered something and not being satisfied with the result.  
People that pre-order a game for the advantages and don't start crying when something goes wrong aren't an issue.dafuq is wrong with people.&gt;And that's what the movie had... Did you not you watch it?
  

no, you replied to this Well, she is the least "gimmicky" of the cast except for rachnera and suu now that she isn't a mental infant anymore.  
And rachnera has her body (lower half) to work against her, considering arachnophobia is one of the most common phobias in the world.  

Mia is also the one with the most scenes thanks to being first, and in general seems to be the one okayado likes to gives the most attention/scenes for.Well now you are just trying to farm downvotes obviously, everyone knows Double Dash is the absolute best.I think Lala could do whatever the fuck she wants tbh, considering she is an Agent of Death and allWW:HD was already way to soon for a remake imo, so TP is in the same boatI think you replied to the wrong commentIt really wouldn't be.  
Ganondorf would sooner kill himself then team up with Link.  
it would be extremely out of character for him to pull a bowser.Many people sorta did throughout the years.  I think all MM fans realized what they were seeing as soon as the distinct fire noise came on.Are we sure the region locking is also for playing with friends ?  
it could be that playing with friends is global, but random match making is continaental.Kinda strange they singled out the MM one, there are lots of reference songs in those balls.  The idea of having Ryu as a third party character had definitly come up several times in my mind, with the announcement of Megaman, my main reason of disregarding the notion was cause I didn't expect Capcom to get 2 fightersGanondorf ARE the high stakes though.  
And I doubt he would.  
I could see this work for a new villain or vaati or something, but ganon(dorf) ? no way.Ghirahim could work if it was his only way to revive Demise  
Zant could also work 

Phantom Ganon could even work, especially considering the way Ganon treats the one in OoT.  (that is, assuming phantom ganon is more than just a being created/controlled by ganondorf)  

This idea could work with just about any character EXCEPT ganondorf.  
Cause ganondorf doesn't bend the knee to anyone.  
Even when he made his both-ways horcrux with Zant, he was still the one taking charge.Not the gamecube's fault it was the fucking best.  
just like how double dash wasit's ok, we can all be wrong in our opinions now and then.  

(for real dude, I'm joking, stop taking this serious)&gt;  It would've been so simple to do

This is never True for ANYTHING in game development (or coding in general)I like to imagine all of these were filmed on different days, and they have just been running around with their costumes on for days on end&gt;According to Wind Waker, Ganondorf does what he does simply because he wants a new home for his people.  

BULLSHIT!  

Guess what, he was on good terms with the king of hyrule, someone who had already decided to accept much less humanoid species into his kingdom to be treated as equal citizens.  
AND guess what the state of the Gerudo was after SEVEN FUCKING YEARS of ganondorf being in command of Hyrule ??  

They were still inside that stupid "winds of death" desert and several of them were being brainwashed to serve as his iron knuckles.  

WW ganondorf's little sob story is nothing but just that, a story he makes up to distract Link, and convince HIMSELF that he isn't THAT bad.   

And Majora is fucking piss compared to ganondorf.  
it took Majora DAYS in order to get his "**LAND-**destroying 'spell' to destroy termina, and in the end it was stopped by 4 giants deciding to just hold the moon up.  

Nothing Majora does is impressive, people really overestimate Majora.  

Ganon(dorf) wouldn't team up to "save the world", cause GANONDORF **IS** THE THING DESTROYING THE WORLD!Some people have this idea that articles that are bad/circlejerk shouldn't earn money, but still be passed around.  

If you don't want to give them money, then stop partaking in their "product"Except that isn't how Gerudo culture works.  
They go into Hylian (or other human) communities, get "boyfriends" (AKA mating partners) and then have sex for the explicit purpose of conceiving childeren.  
These childeren are all born female, except for the one male every hundred years.  

When they are not able to "find" "boyfriends" normally, they kidnap and then presumably "convince" or rape them.  

The Gerudo King is not a Queen Bee.Final attack against Hades was little more but supplying the fuel for the GUN to do the work.    
again, pure supportive work.  
Mr. Satan made sure humanity was willing to give their energy to the spirit bomb, but does that make Satan powerfull, or Goku ?  
(trick question, mr. Satan is the strongest man in the universe)    

I assume the clobber laser is the one she uses if you suck to much ass at Hewdraw's aerial battle?  
Guess you can count that, but imo that's like counting the super guide as an actual event/thing in the games that have it.  
Or counting the golden tanooki suit/leaf, etc....  
Personally I don't consider things like those as the "canon" turn of events.  

Either way, it is a single lazer as opposed to all of the attacks most other gods, or even just the "angel-class" generals of the other factions, have.  
And during her fight, as well as during the "boosted rematch" created by Dyntos, she is by far the weakest and easiest boss in the game.  
Her entire character is also based around being a "support", which is perfectly fine, it just means that "a literal god" doesn't mean that much in the Kid Icarus universe beyond being a status/rank or even just a species.I didn't.  
Which one is supposed to be deleted ?Not really no.  
It is pretty much OoT+  

Several other games are way "odder" compared to the others.I'm not, no.  
I know who Ganondorf is OZONE...  
I'm the dick, not captain obvious.SS is an amazing game imo.  
I'd strongly recommend it.  
Don't just listen to whatever people say, especially with zelda considering the zelda cycle...  
Make your own opinions.  


Re-read his comment, he never said they are redoing the rewards system, but it is very much posible other things got shifted around after Iwata's Passing, and thus the timetable is no longer the sameChibi would be pretty well of by having a double Bastet Stand, that's True.Villagers will sometimes show you letters they got from other people, or even "remind" you of letters you send them.  

Selling villagers is done when they say they want to move out, and then have someone else visit your town and come talk to that villager and convince them to come to that person's village,Everyone knows you don't punch a dude in the sword, shit's just not right.They are a seperate race in that they have different specifications, being tanned skin, red eyes and red hair.  
And their genes are so dominant that even when mixing with other "human" races, the resulting baby will not lose their "gerudo" genes/dna or even have them weakened.   
They are a seperate race as much as Humans and Hylians are.  

Essentially, no different from the different races IRL-humans have, except that they have more obvious differences that don't mix.So much butthurt, it's like you bitches have never been Nintendo fans before.Monster Musume

I would say D. GrayMan, but then I would also be lying about there having been new chapters in ... ever...Holy shit that was great.I think I don't remember the ones I disliked/hated the most.  

Probably baby park in MK8, it works in DD because DD is awesome and has awesome oversized items, but it just doesn't work in MK8, especialy with the barrier stopping everythingI want advance wars, and a good paper mario again, and a sequel to codename S.T.E.A.M.  

But atm, I'm not very hyped for even a "standard" fire emblem, so let alone one that changes the setting so much.Personally I'd love to see Venom snake get inI'm looking forward to eventually being able to play it with my friends once they get the PAL version working.They both are.  
Humanity itself is cancerNo, they are not a different species.  
Essentially, the species "human" include the races : Hylian, 'human', Sheikah, Gerudo, and possibly more.Mia.  
Centorea is pretty much near the middle for me.  
Her personality is funny, but not at all desirable imo.  
Same with mero (getting somewhat better since meromom chapters) and papi.  

For the mains girls, I'd go :  
Mia &gt; Suu &gt; Lala &gt; Arachne &gt; Cerea &gt; Mero &gt; PapiObviously it should be me.IIRC it was something like them "living together as equals" or "dining on the same table" or something like that.  
Still kept the "equal status" part, but dropped the sexy timesTrue.  
I'd love to see it, but it is pretty unlikely to happenDS is the only one I never really played tbh, but I could see it being even worse in that one, atleast the mk8 one looks beautifull and the 12 racers thing helps to make it a bit more chaotic atleastIt's a clever shitpost that is in facta lovely compliment[Die](https://vine.co/v/OprQ6hnYwEj)   [Dantheman7913](/u/Dantheman7913), [Die](https://vine.co/v/OprQ6hnYwEj)  

(can you believe Youtube didn't have this clip in English?  Had to go to vine to find it)You sure the last guy is oiled up?Man, the 3 summons/comment rule really makes your job way harder does't it...Little funfact : None of the heroes that had multiple games ever saved Hyrule twice, with the exception of the first one   

Other funfact : Every hero has saved 'Hyrule', or what was gonna become/used to be, Hyrule, except for the Hero of Spirits/Trains as saved NEW Hryule (it's totally different)TBH, I was sorta expecting that/keeping it as a definitive chance.  
So far, all games using the same engine/artstyle/graphics have been direct sequels. (PH&gt;ST did switch Links though)  

It also ties together with the whole "ALBW == ALttP2", afterall, ALttP had adventures after him saving Hyrule as well.There is nothing inconsistent about this placement...  
At worst the issue is that he lost all his items, but all Links do that when swapping games.He actually starts the game with a different costume then his green tunic, namely the second outfit in [this picture](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/j917hzwiwwdxyzlr6h1b.jpg)  

Huh, guess I was right afterall.  
This actually makes ever game using the same engine* as a different game a direct sequel, and also means every Link has saved Hyrule once (with the exception of Spirit tracks Link if we do not count New Hyrule as 'Hyrule')  
Also, only the Nes/OG Link ever saved(/adventured through) Hyrule twice.  

Edit : *mostly talking about "same engine" as in : visually and mechanically the same.  
(OoT and MM, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, ALBW and TFH)
The Toon Link "look" has popped up all around the timeline by now (although this is actually the first instance in the fallen timeline where they use it)  
But they do mention Link dressing up different, and he starts the game without his tunic, and in [this](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/j917hzwiwwdxyzlr6h1b.jpg) bear-logo shirt.  

He gets his tunic from the outfit maker, who clearly based it on the "look" of the legendary heroes of their legends.  
it could be the tunic is based on Minish Cap Link (which uses the toon Link look)  
(Also, Minish Cap Link did in fact split into multiple Links, so maybe the legend for "morphed" throughout the years to be about 3 (instead of 4) Links that were actually different people instead of mirages created by a sword.Just gonna Ctrl C+V a comment from a different thread.  
In response too :  
&gt;That's really weird, considering this is just WW Link design and ALBW's Link clearly wasn't.

Rule 1 of Nintendo (or anything tbh) canon : Do not listen to *'suits'* that have nothing to do with development.  
(siderule : Statements by people that DO have something to do with canon should always be considered in their context: Were they prepared for the question, was the translation clear enough, etc...)ALBW and TFH are the first games in the fallen hero timeline since essentially the oracle games.  

Little funfact : Fallen hero timeline only has 3 heroes in it.  
if we count OoT as a hero for both the child (this one he does either way ebcause of MM) and adult line, then all branches now have 3.

Which costed me around \u20ac90Depends, if you consider where the split happens storywise, then OoT is part of the Adult Timeline but not (decently) of the child timeline.  
The events that we see/do during OoT only happen during the Adult timeline, not the other two  

(and otherwise : clearly this means Zelda U will be in the Adult timeline :p)Not very strange to think so, considering both Midna's are "adult", and are better known as "imp Midna" and "twili/True midna"Hah, just wait till Fates comes around.  
Wonder how Soldier-amie, undressing enemies and marrying/impregnating a 10 year old are gonna be written down asI think it's the Animalese sounds, and the ESRB just heard one that sounded like farts.A lot of these mention farts, are farts really considered "offensive" or otherwise "warning-worthy" ?

Damn,it looks like Tingle's Rosie rupeeland was made a bit to early.  
I would love to hear them explain [this scene](https://youtu.be/0j6QGyoMEjo?t=55s)My bad, I sorta meant the games that actually re-use assets/the same graphical style.  
WW and TP do indeed have a similar engine.Ow right, I forgot you guys never got the best ZeldaNo restraint needed.  
I would have bought them all if over half of the first wave didn't look so bad.  

Generally speaking : if they hadn't forced themselves to use the horrible artwork poses  (horrible as in : for figurine production) then I probably would have bought all of them/all of the ones my friends don't have at the least.  

But stuff like Link's pee stick prevented me from considering collecting them, so I just bought the ones I genuinly liked.  

If they ever make a LoZ set I'll buy them 'all' though.    

(what we really need is a set of 101 amiibo for W101 though, I'd buy them all)No new Zelda U information was revealed in the famitsu articleDoesn't count till it happens in a game.Dunno, Soldier-amie and the pseudo-sex scenes/audio can be edited out   
The undressing units with armor breaking could be simply not done and just replaced with a "cracked armor" icon or something and the last one could be re-written as her being older, but just having a petite frame (although it's gonna be a though sell to say she and the other "little sister" are legal in any way by western standards)  or removing her creating a child.  

However, each of these will obviously create a major drama scene amongst the purists, I mean, they are already flipping their god damn shit over some bikini outfits that got replaced by way cooler outfits in Fatal frame, so those changes will cause a massive shitstorm.  

Who knows&gt; I think that game will kill the franchise in America, which makes me sad.

Meh, I usually don't get sad by a shell dying, unless it's shedinja.Clearly he disguised his face with magic.Could be.  
Either way, it definitly seems like the coupons will be involved.I specified thatIt's pretty great, Personally I would love a sequel (love balloon trip is cool, but not really a sequel to Rosie rupeeland's gameplay)&gt;  Link ever saved(/**adventured through**)

I actually strongly disagree with the 3D-rank 2.  
The sword fighting in SS controlled better then the buttons imo, and like you said : "turns every swordfight into a puzzle"  
Which is better then : "turns every swordfight into a waiting/timing minigame"  

You also got to remember the other "handling" into it imo, and the beetle and bow are definitly much better then the c-stick bow in other games  
(although admitingly, the remakes have sorta fixed this for some of the other ones too)  

I don't really care enough by the other stuff I don't agree with the comment on it.  
nice videoAnd offcourse WW won, it's cause WW is the fucking best !!Could be it's more like the oracle games, with the "vague canon" thing being the fact there are 3 links for SOME reason, instead of "which happens first ?!?"  

Although it definitly has the Awakening part of : "not actually mattering in the grander series-wide canon"Essentially it is the A Link to the past story but with the specifics/end results of the Ocarina of Time story for SOME reason.  

We end up with the triforce split in 3, with 1 being stuck with Ganon, one being held by the royalty , and one recuiring the hero to proof himself by assembling something (either the triforce itself or "the order of the sages")

.

It could very well be that we have a bit of a "the flood" or "hero of men" story here, with the events not actually being an existing game.  
Some time after Alttp, Ganon breaks free/comes back and the battle ends up more like OoT this time.  

But the only real answer anyone can give you is : we're not sure ourselves.

MM also has Link being a year older, so it fits that he would do a bunch of stuff in hyrule for that year.gimme one good reason it "should" have been non-canon ?  
We have a game about trains, one with a time loop and 2 that happen both one before the other and the other before the one at the same time in the canon, so I think one where a Link is depicted slightly different isn't that big of an issue.If we think about it, WW's statue of OoT Link doesn't like shit-all like OoT Link.&gt;There's already a bit of evidence toward that.  

you mean, there is a couple of theories that would be helped forward a LOT if it was confirmed.The kokiri don't even need to be killed off.  
They could have just hidden.  
Both the kokiri and their wooden korok versions are essentially "forest spirirts"  
You never see the koroks until they decide to show themselves, so it could be they are just good at hiding.  
Alttp Link never met them cause there was no reason for him to meet them.  Except they totally can, and just did.It could easily be they will be released in Japan as some interview or article later.  
There is even an interview about TFH coming up in kotaku soon-ish, so it could be placed in there for all we know.True, though at the same time, Ganon being sealed in the Sacred Realm could have meant his influence being gone, or at the very least lessened in Hyrule.  
Possibly resulting in the sprout appearing either way, or the deku tree being reborn in some other way.  
It could even be the whole reason as to why they hid/went away, as the deku tree could no longer handle protecting cause the dark influence was weaker, but not gone entirely.  

Either way though, the real question would be, IF they survived (or the knowledge of their existance did) why is Hytopia the place to remember them/know of them ?Well that is the issue with a bunch of "junkfood theorist" fans begging for it.  
They voted for it, but those are the sort of people that "want to know", but will ignore it 5 minutes later.  

Same type of people that just ***GOBBLE*** up *gametheorists* their "buh buh, just a theory, a game theory !" theories.  

They want to feel included in the theory talk, and pretend like they care, but really they just want to get some fairy tal-ish pseudo-trivia to gush and circlejerk about on the internet or to their equally unknowing friends.  

I mean, we are talking about the sortof people that belief Ganondorf's sob story in WW without a second thought and fell for the whole "link is dead in MM" piece of shit theory.Except gramps isn't evidence, cause there is nothing to assume he is a hero outside of having a sword that looks like the mastersword in a mini-game that is already lore-unfriendly to begin with.  

PS: You know the rule Serb, I have to give you shit on your "multiple Heroes existing" points atleast once every mention of it.  
It's not like I WANT to do it, but rules are the rules you know.  
Don't wanna lose my license and shit.Well, it sorta seems like the King of Hyrule was mostly what was keeping the races together anyway.  
So his death definitly could have caused that.  
But who knows.  

Some people think the kokiri evolved into monkeys in the child timeline, so who can really tell what those guys are capable off anyway.  
(apparently their newest disguise is ripping of robin hood even more then Link's tunic already did though)All of that just points at proof he was *A* legend, and I definitly won't say he couldn't have been *A* hero.  
But "a hero" and "a link"/a reincarnated "spirit of the hero" is not the same.  

Yeah but Farts are also mentioned in once where there ware way more obvious/worse things that don't get mentioned.  
just thought it was strange.True.  
Though he did help hyruleans in that story, so he didn't save "hyrule" he did help some hyruleans.  

though it is also sorta unclear about what constitues hyrule and what doesn't in LoZ II, cause historia seems to consider only the part from loZ I to be hryule, and the rest to be "next to" hyrule or something.  
pretty unclear, have to look into that again sometimeA reason for that ?Same can be said about a bunch of stuff dude.  
How come a lot of non-reincarnation trio people keep showing up, how come the hylian shield design jumps all over the place.  
Why does Impa in SS have a tear symbol,if the tear symbolizes the betrayal of the royal family of hyrule, before there is a royal family of hyrule, etc...There are some stylistic choices that we really shouldn't overanalyze, even my theory was really just for fun tbh.  
i doubt that is the actual reason, and more likely the actual answer is just : 'this game wanted to use toon link/a combination between Toon link and ALBW LinkI'd essentially be a benelovent unknown tyrant if that makes sense.  
I would make everything good and shit, but call me an asshole once and "pop", you're now stuck head first into your own asshole somehow.  

For real though, I'd probably just use it to remove all hassles, and be to lazy to change anything for the rest.Wonderful 101 came out in 2013, so Awakenign isn't even CLOSE to being the most enjoyable for me.Touch screen unit movement again for one.  
fucking stupid that Awakening didn't have it.Part 7,except halfway through development, we are changing this shit into a "karting" game.  Yes he did.  
In a little-known game (can't blame you for not knowing this one) called "A Link to the Past"  
Yeah right, next you will tell me Cashews come from a fruit...Reminds me of the "backgrounds" on traveling carnival atractions over here.  
Filled with clearly copyrighted stuff in random placement and with unfitting artstyles.  

Yeah i know, hard to believe it exists, seems like nobody played that one or somethingDon't lie op, you don't hate it, and you really just want 2 copies don't you ?!?the worst part is the fact it was actually positive +6 when it got nuked.Is it really "biased" when it is the truth though?  
Is saying Goku is stronger than Krillin "biased" ?  
no, it's the truth.But you don't get it.  
These overdone "ligerie" otufits were replaced with references to other Nintendo characters, HOW DARE THEY give us something else of equal or higher quality !!Cause that's the subjectiveWell he is still missing a lantern and whatnot, and I strongly doubt it isn't canon that he saved all the maimais and got the *nice* items.  

But who knows what happened, maybe he sold the items when he was trying to continue Ravio's shop to see if it was something for him.  Good one puff.&gt;There is contradictory information in the game regarding certain enemies and races   

Welcome to over half the zelda games.  
might I remind you Zelda II has towns named after sages that failed/never even existed that timeline ?  

&gt;Zelda is not mentioned at all  

She is only ever mentioned in a fleeting comment in Awakening, and has *all* of a flashback dedicated to her in MM, not really something that new.  

&gt;There are two conflicting story paths that bog down the canon of this particular game, much less where it fits among the other games (i.e., we don't know whether the single player or multiplayer version of the story is the canon story, regardless of whether that information is important).  

two words : Oracle Games.Jep, and all the childeren are then put into little hyperbolic time chambers so that they can grow up with barely any parent interaction and barely any decent childhood to call their own and come serve in your glorious army (pretty sure Kamui is the tyranical villain this time)Simple : cause the games have different artstyles for their characters.  

Zelda I Link and Zelda II Link their sprites don't look anything alike.  

Ocarina of Time Link and The statue of him in Sunken Hyrule don't look anything alike, 

Skull Kid in MM  doesn't look anything like TP Skull kid (even though they are the same character)...    

Ganondorf in WW and TP don't look alike to either each other, or their OoT form  

Ganon morphs all over the place, despite being the same being in all games, sometimes he is big and wide and blue, sometimes he looks like in OoT, sometimes he is just a giant boar, etc...  

All moblins are the same species yet look vastly different  
Stalls go from being human skeletons to having some weird dog-skull as face.  
etc...That perfect flair.Well they also aren't catering to their old fans, that's for sure.Well even if I place Wonderfull 101 into the seperate category of : "best game of the decade", to free of the year, we still had a couple 2013 games that were much more enjoyable imo.That would have been nice if all amiibo were out near launch, and we had like 50% of the roster as unlockable, instead of the pretty sad state WiiU had for its unlockable.Actually, a totally unbiased dude just calculated through pure drunk-fueled MATH that MM is actually the worst 3D zelda.People are overhyping this so much.  Seeing some major overhyping being done here.The issue with it is that that would mean your playable area is all there is to the world, which can make the world seem really small.  
Imagine of WW worked like that.  
Then that would mean that is all there is to the world, which wouldn't work for the future games and story.  
I mean, I fully believe it will come to wiiU  
But these weren't direct quotes per-say.  
This could easily be paraphrased.Except that means you are essentially  designing 3 games.   

Good difficulty is actually designed into the game, it isn't just changing some rando values.  
It doesn't matter if a guy does a quarter heart or 5 hearts of damage if you are never gonne be hit by him.Except their "too much water" point made sense, and it was a legit complaint/issue the fanbase repeated ad nauseum for Ruby/saphire and that wasn't fixed for the remake.    
But just cause it is IGN that is saying it (in a bullet point without retards reading the actual review and then circlejerking about it) it is suddenly a meme.  

They gave Alpha Saphire a very fitting (maybe even too generous) score for what it was.&gt;all zeldas are *Great*, but which ones are *The Best* depends on who you talk toYou trying to take away my rock pikmin ?!?  

Besides, Rock Pikmin are just as deserving as any other type.  
They deal good damage when thrown, in exchange for not latching.  
They can break obstacles the fastest when thrown, but the slowest when doing it manually, etc...  

They are also imperverious against squishying, making them great for wogs, etc...

I don't see what would be beneficial to do away with rock pikmin, they are great as-is.  
And it is not like we don't have a shit-ton of colors left or something&gt; But she did still appear/was mentioned in those games. She is not mentioned at all in TFH, so it is something new.

&gt;There is in-game evidence telling us which order is most likely the canon order of those games, but we seem to have exactly the same amount of evidence for whether the single player or multiplayer is canon in TFH.  

Ow, didn't know you completed the game 100% already.  

I mean, no offense, but you are a useless piece of shit, no offense meant though, so it's ok.I mean, no offense, but you are a useless piece of shit, no offense meant though, so it's ok.What a surprise, PAL brethren are fucked over most **WHO COULD HAVE GUESSED** (you know, except anyone that paid attention to the industry in the last 15 years)I think catering to anything that is upset they can't impregante a fucking 10 year old is catering to the wrong anythingIt could work in the games that take place in other dimensions or something, but when we are talking about "main hyrule", it would make the world seem really small, or be nea rimpossible to make and fill decently.Actually I was just showing you that saying something offensive and adding : "no offense meant' before it doesn't change the fact the comment came over offensive."You'll understand when you're older"Pretty sure a 5y old would just blankly stare at you if you said it like that.What a surprise, PAL is behind NA again.  
*NEVER* could have guessed that.And do what ?  
Nothing ?  

Sheik didn't DO anything.  
All of the areas are still fucked when Link wakes up, so at most you could sneak into the ice cavern to save Ruto.  
Besides that, Sheik is a character whose only role in the story is to teach you songs.  

It really wouldn't be.Bowser considers himself a bad guy, so even from his perspective, Mario would still be the good guy.  
His entire Army actually calls him varrying titles that all mean he is the villain, and he loves it.  
He always makes sure to let you know he isn't saved the kingdom/multiverse/whatever because he is good, but because he wants to destroy/conquer it himself, etc.... Freshly Stretched, Wii Fit trainer's yoga fitnesslandAnd he didn't use his stand for a glorious Part 2 Joseph return!I liked him a lot, and his stand was awesome.  
not to mention figuring out to use alcohol as a debuff to enemies by injecting it into their bodies ?  
genius.  

Only thing I hate about him is how little screentime he got.The guy with Mandom was just stupid imo. 
Ringo Roadagain I think his name was (which is already a stupid name) 

He speaks about "fair battles" and "proof of being a man" and all that bullshit.  
yet he uses his stand against someone without a stand, and didn't explain it to that person either, while afterwards pretending like he is 'oh so fair' for telling the others about it.  

His reasoning is also retarded and his arc is pretty stupid.
Only (very remotely) good thing about him is that he reveals the whole : "johhny would kill without hesitation when needed" thingI wasn't talking about that at all actually.  
I am talking about people thinking stuff like having multiple dimensions with each their own theme and the size of the rest of the world and shit like that.  

SS was an amazing game."trained"  
As in : uses magic to hide herself, get her ass kicked in record time by bongo bongo and use deku nuts to pull a cheap dissapearing act ?  

There is no mention of Impa training Zelda in any way during the game, she "hid" zelda.  
All of the whole "Sheik is awesome ninja buhbuhbuh" comes from fan ravings, its design and smash bros.  
True, which is why i think nobody in this thread is fulfilling the op's question completely right.Or we just let Ocarina of time be, and give Zelda an actual fucking game/story of her own.  
there is more to the fucking zelda series then ocarina you knowI strongly disagree, SS was amazing.So in reality you are just talking about Mario spin offsReally stupid character and arc imo.sounds like a scoopy doo villain tbh...We have never even seen a sheikah do anything beyond Impa in SS (in which she is just the servant of the goddess in general)   
Impa in OoT is never seen doing anything except pull the same cheap dissapearing act.  
All of the sheikah's whole "OMG EPIC UNBEATABLE NINJA WARRIORS" reputation comes from the fanon, not the canon.  

Show me a sheikah warrior doing anything special in the canon series.  
Spoiler alert, you can't, cause they never do anything except for Impa in SS, which again, has only the smallest of direct connections to the sheikah race.  

Saying SS Impa is proof of anything would be like saying Ganondorf is prood that all Gerudo are dark magic wielding evil overlords.There is still with easy, Cyan, (dark) Green, Lime, brown, Orange (no way a strong orange would "blend" with a strong yellow or red) and so forth.  

Guess we should just remove pinks and replace them with little helicopters and replace whites with gasmasks.  

Immunity against being crushed is only as OP as the developpers make it.  
There are tons of different hazards, and even more they could come up with.  
Stunning enemies by landing on them and being as strong as 10 pikmin is WAY more op then anything the Rocks have ever done.  

So should we remove Purples and replace them with little forklifts ?  

And why would yellows be the only one allowed holding rocks ?  
how would they balance that, do we need to go look for fucking rocks every morning ?  
How would I specify whether I want the yellows to throw a well-aimed rock at a bulborbs eye to flinch it, or whether I want to thorw the yellow itself ?  

besides, yellows already have lightning resistance and higher throws

There is no reason to remove rock Pikmin.Which was already a really weird thing they took over from whites to have yellow be the "digger"  Impa in SS is what she is cause she is the servant of the goddess, not cause she is a sheikah.  
Other impa's(or "sheikah" which we have never seen outside of (some) impa's)  have never shown any similar powers.Dunno, in that case I'd rather see a ground/mud-based pikmin in the next game which in general would just be a good digger, maybe even being able to unearth other pikmin and themselves (like the pluckaphone but standardly), and when dismissed they hide by digging themselves back in, etc...  

Yellows digging with their ears is pretty meh imoReally great video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Onq0DOfz9lAThe sheikah during that time (which is a thick fat one for their entire known headcount) sure, but all later sheikah (which is still only ever a 1)  have not shown any of the kind, and have in fact never done anything but a deku nut escape and running away on a horse.  
2... BILLION!Never more then 1 at a time"IF LoZ went down the same path FE did"IIRC, it was also made in a very low amount of time, and with a lot of nagging from above to do X or Y differentlySaying "that's a game theory anyway" is like saying "Well it was written on the toilets at school anyway"Maybe one day she'll be relevant again.  

Almost believed it myself there for a second.Dunno, you can actually see shikata's arm atleast.It existing.There are like 3, and all 3 of them are used as a way to discover the region, I really don't see why people hate them that much.  
None of them even take that long, it's like 5~8 minutes tops.Only way that would be a thing is if they made the dungeons after the game was done.  

That said, something cool could be having each of the amiibo unlock a special extra bossfight from one of the other games.Dunno, I would enjoy amiibo support for the simple fact that we would have a Zelda amiibo line.Not really no.  
Fates has shown that when I said : "no way man, trust IS"   
I was wrong.  

There is a difference between "pessimistic" and "realisitic"  
With the second one being, that when your series that took a major leap downwards for you, suddenly decides that rock bottom isn't deep enough, you have to accept that maybe everything will not be ok for once.~Gee wiz mr. dash, Are you telling me opinions are Subjective ? 
Who would have thought  
Maybe I should have specifically mentioned "for me" and "imo" or something,   
ow wait... i did.  

Either way, Like I said, even without W101, we also got : 
- Legend of Zelda : A Link between worlds, Luigi's Mansion : Dark Moon, Little Inferno, Lego City undercover, Monster Hunter 3Ultimate, Animal Crossing New Leaf, Xcom, New Super Luigi U, Pikmin 3, Mario and Luigi Dream team, Rayman legends, The Legend of Zelda :  Windwaker HD And Super Mario 3D world  

And those are just the ones I personally would vouch for, there are several others from 2013 that I heard a lot of good things about.  

But either way, just to be sure : that's ***IMO***, which stands for : ***IN MY OPINION*** which means I am stating it as an opinion/personal statement, not a fact.This just proves that fashion works in cycles.Or maybe to try to bribe people into being friends ?He isn't a character, he is a powerup.In extension, 50 fact extravaganza is one year old now : **BUTTONS!!**Also : One year of Ridley being deconfirmed absolutely, which still brings me back to my lung-shattering laughing fit when I saw it.It's definitly niche though.  
JRPG's have long fallen away from their once near-unrivaled pedestal.  
Now any jrpg that isn't an old-school franchise by name is not really something the average gamer jumps into.What I just *love* about zelda, is how her side B makes her helpless for no reason since melee, and instead of fixing it for SM4Sh they were like : "let's give her another move that does this"Smash "lore" ...Nope.Even if either of them was, what smash decides to do has no backwards connection to Mario.  
Metal mario is not a "character"  
it is a powerup.  

No different from racoon Mario or Cat PeachSorry, but that is just super biased.  

I wasn't saying anything on whether metal should be in or not,   
Just that he isn't a character  himself  
but if you are saying metal deserves it, then all of the powerups/alt versions are fair game.  

Except metal doesn't have an excuse.  
they just decided to distort and reverse stuff to give him *a thing*, he never had a backstory nor does he have a personality of his own.    
If anything, raccoon Mario is older, and his taunts are better with the statue forming, following that logic it is the much more logic "alt. version"to be added.    

Metal mario has no reason to be in more then any other alt. version, it's still just Mario with a powerup.Xenoblade would do better with the whole "open-world rpg" if its gameplay/battle system was action adventure in that case
The jrpg vibe just drips from the way you battle stuff, and it is keeping a lot of people away from it.  
offcourse it is what it wants to do, and it shouldn't change  
but the sort of "open-world rpg" that is super popular lately is stuff like skyrim, where you just run around and do stuff, and your controls and attacks and so forth, stay the same between walking around and 'fighting'  

JRPGs *scare* quite a lot of people away with how accesable they seem.Opposite is also annoying then, but for them.  
Explain all of the great games they market, and nobody buys them cause : "new ip"  
it happened a lot already.  
not to mention franchises they create big pushes for, nothing comes out of it, and then people just go : "why no new ~~metroid~~games in *this* series?!?" ignoring the simple fact the series is a risk.  

Besides, they definitly pre-marketted XenobladeX quite a bit already, It even got treehouse streams for itself.  

There is no saying whether they won't market it better in the coming month, but the simple thing is, that even if you are an "above average" JRPG, if your name isn't Final Fantasy or something, most people will ignore you, either on account of being a JRPG, or for not being "the right one"  

&gt; to manage to get the game localized in the west.  

Barely managed to do so.  
Xenoblade already got marketted more then most other B-list franchises they have. and it is definitly still a risk/wonky deal for them.  
Anyone thinking it isn't is kidding themselves. (Especially since it is on the WiiU)As if Mario's series (especially the 'extended universe')  doesn't have a bunch of people they could still add for heavy weight (including one they actually cut since wii : funky)   

that's a weak reason.  
here is a "practical reason" for metal mario : it's mario with a metalic texture over it, making it way easier to make then adding a completely different character to the mix.Except raccoon Mario has way better taunts then anything they ever did with metal mario, and has much more work put into that.  
And in general, more work went into the simple fact that raccoon Mario and cat peach and dry bowser actually have different models unlike metal/pgp  

Saying Metal is better/more deserving than those others because of a voice morph is extremely biased

So Actually he is.Cause Mario already has a bunch of reps, and the spin offs are already represented by moves and stages, and most importantly : Cause they have nothing interesting to base a moveset out of, while there are a bunch of other characters they CAN do that with.  

Waluigi would have SOME chance if they finally started using him for something other then spin offs, but the best Daisy can wish for is an "alph" situation where the narrator changes his call from peach to daisy for her alt costume.  

although "Paper Mario" or a rep for one of thise spin off series, makes way more chance then just "some characters that are only used for the spin offs, which are already represented anyway"Inklings have much more reason, cause they are actually from a new IP.  
It would be like having Ralph in smash, you guys remember ralph don't you ?  
From that one zelda game : Oracle of Ages and no other ones, yeah clearly he deserves to be in.I was watching the extravaganze at a friends house and I just laughed my lungs out, I distinctly remember going : "OMG, I have so many people to yell : 'Told you so' at now"  

aaaah, it's good to be a dick.  
Especially towards ridlievers.Cause you are placing more worth in order on random stuff to have metal mario have a "better reason" to be in then the others, cause you WANT him to have one.In which games was he a "main"character  
In smash ?  
in smash he was a 'mini-boss' that was just mario with a constant metal box effect.  

in SM64 ? he was a POWERUP in there, nothing else  
In the DS remake, it wasn't even Mario that turned metal, but Wario.  

Your reasoning is literally : "this powerup is special, but these other powerups (that are either more recent/relevant or have appeared more) aren't.Way to skim over all the actual discussion retorts.  

either way, I don't see why you would want them to remove a pikmin type, and it won't happen.  
They might sit a game out like white and purple did for 3's story, but they will never retcon them.It's cause Hytopia has a bit of a "French" flair to it, as it is supposed to be like a Hyrulean(world) version of paris and be this "country of fashion" and stuff.  

I don't see how it is out of place for a zelda game.  
I also don't see how either of those things is "kids game" or "young demographic" tbh.  [Cause he has psychic powers right?](http://i.imgur.com/drLZVLn.jpg)  
[I get it](http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/75/a4/75a496_5256277.jpg)Lol, that wasn't even what this is about, you keep pretending like metal mario is this shining beacon above the other alt forms, for arbatrary reasons, this is even more tiring then talking about your *other* delusions that sound "oooh so familiar".  

And mario spin offs aren't a spin off of smash.  
What happens in smash has no effect on the mario series as a whole.  
Well all the games that have used the same engine/reused the assets of each other, have been direct sequels after all.  

Personally I don't see why people find it so hard to belief that this is its placement, just cause Link looks a bit different ?  It's "headcanon", with one n, just like it is "Ganondorf" with one n.  
You aren't firing heads from a cannon, you are pretending like something is "canon" in your head.  

Also known as : "not actually canon" and : "might as well be called fanon" or "made up nonsense"  

Either way, it does little to help your pointSorry, I only talk to sailors.Yes, exactly, like I said : BiasThat is not what Bias means, no.  

for more on the subject : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BiasExcept they can still do what the other pikmin can do.Blue pikmin could be completely replaced by making the pikmin not need oxygen or have them know how to swim, doesn't mean they should go.  So because they are unique beyond "resists this element", they should be replaced by rocks ?  

yeah sure.  
Rock pikmin are awesome, and removing them would not do anything positive and would create balancing issues.  

There is no reason to 'remove' them.with a shovelNot to mention buying the system you are playing it on.  
In an arcade, you were essentially paying for the use of their establishment and their games.  This issue comes up when it is no longer optional, or the "optional" content starts affecting the normal content though.  

Also, this still doesn't explain you VERY faulty "arcades were like totaly microtransactions guys"You could play triforce heroes online though.  

Either way, Spirit Tracks is a great game, very enjoyable.It might be because you weren't starting at the right time.  
A friend borrowed my copy and got stuck on one of the flute sections and I spend like 15 minutes trying it myself, and then we looked up online if we did something wrong, and I noticed the lets player actually numbered the notes and passing and then i remembered you actually have to start on the right part of the metronome.Yeah, not letting mario walk "exit stage right" after hitting the flagpole is pretty funnyGamers like to overreact and cirlejerk in general, same with water temple from OoT and so forth.Zelda II I guess, can't really think of a "hard" nintendo game that wasn't just hard because of wonky controls though.    

I completed brawl's challenges without hammers.  
SM3DW, DKCTF and so forth were all completed, etc... 
All metroids except nes one.  
(which falls under : hard for the wrong reasons imo.)  

Do we count W101 as a Nintendo game ?  
Cause completing that one was pretty though, with all the pure platinum requirements and stuff, etc..
So ?  Not to mention skullkid between OoT/MM and TPWell aren't you a Pink glasses Pail[AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!](http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljavvdtQIp1qa6m7no1_500.png)[Bullet point three talks about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pikmin/comments/2jigyk/what_are_your_ideas_for_pikmin_4/clc4zxd)K, so I overshot the comparison, Diasy still has no reason to be in smash as anything but a peach costume.I think you misread my comment pal.  I am ?True.They wouldn't have been, cause she didn't do anything.  
There is absolutely no proof of her saving anyone besides ruto (which you otherwise would have done like 5 minutes later)  
I do ?!?That's a beautiful duwang.K.  

...

Yes.That's the thing though, if it is stuff made beforehand, it would have been better for the customer if it was just time spent on something else.K.  
But what if the amiibo will be BIG and made out of lead ?!?The burden of proof lies in the lap of the one claiming there to be something, not the other way aroundReally ?  
could have sworn it did, nvm thenHow do they not have plot significance ?  
THey are the reason you can't go into the other regions beforehand, whyyou can discover the entire region without people seeing you and are what is plaguing hyrule, and you do it to save the ligth spirirts.  

Hmmm, i've never had trouble with it except for the time I was starting wrong tbh...TrueMe and an IRL friend were playing with randoms, and each one of them have been great so far.  
Every time someone leaves it's "NOOOOOOOO" followed by : "aah well, bye" 
Every time something goes well : "POM POM DANCE" and "OK"  
Everytime nobody knows what to do it is running around and spamming "shrug"  
Glorious.  We are finally playing a game that uses Link's "mute-ness" as a gameplay element !Very different, but just as fun imo.  
maybe even more fun.  

But all of the fun lies in working together and the puzzles, and there is no big story or anything behind it.  A night-section is something I have been hoping for for a while yes.  
Especially since Pikmin 3 has the whole "stealth" by hiding behind clovers and 'bushes' and stuff.Let's not kid ourselves, she also could have been *that* without all the poses, zoom ins and barely functional clothing.  
Motion capture and likeness are also based on her.Except the time you come back as human, you need to solve stuff differently, and there are very different challenges/situations going on.  

THis is no different from having to re-do areas in OoT as child and adult.&gt; need to inspire people to defend themselves or trigger environmental hazards.

This sounds ten times more tedious.  

&gt;his could be as minor as cutting out all of the loose bugs to reduce tedium or as major as overhauling them with new puzzles.

almost all of the tears are either on the way to an area, or are a puzzle.  
THere are very little bugs that are "just there"  

Sounds like major reaching just to put the blame of something on those, every other game as had stuff like that all the same.  
But if you honestly belief the twilight sections do nothing for the story/setting, then you are either Arin-levels of not-paying-attention or you are retarded (or the actual most likely reasoning : just circlejerking)&gt;As a child Zora's Domain isn't completely frozen over for example.  

[funny](https://youtu.be/cCFQBitJvrw?t=41m29s)  

Twilight Princess "dried up lake hylia" and "frozen zora's domain" are way more different then frozen or normal zora's domain in OoT, which doesn't changes anything about how to go through them.  
Which is bullshit, cause she has the exact same 'way' of breathing as [this guy](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/metalgear/images/0/07/Chara_end_pic-0.gif/revision/latest?cb=20140705174500) lorewise and he is wearing full-body clothingI was talking about the zoom ins on her boobs all the time during cutscenes and the like, not the manual zoom function, her sticking her butt out in the chopper and walking like a hooker.  

And there is no excuse for her clothes either way.  

lemme guess, there was NO WAY for them to show the [sniper skulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEDVls6Svzo) except with that cutscene right ?  
There was absolutly no ulterior motive on their choice of camera movement and placement am I correct?Cause that is how Hylia designed her obviously.  
(not like she ever walks anyway)I don't care about quiet being that way, nor those other characters.  
But you can't honestly say that she isn't designed the way she is just cause Kojima wanted to give you a boner.  

This isn't something new though.  
Metal gear has always been that way, with zooming in butts and people wearing jackets that are zipper open to reveal their cleavage, etc... 



Jes&gt; "On the way to something" IS being just there.

And takes all of 5 seconds to kill.  
Following that logic, we might as well remove all enemies that aren't part of the story or a puzzle.

&gt;If the Twilight sections were removed the game would not suffer for it in any way. Also the Sky Letters.  

sky letters are not at all comparable to the twilight sections.  Except I never said it wasn't the other way around either.  
But again, that is par for the course or metal gear.  
IMO there also is nothing wrong quiet being boner-fuel.  
But saying she isn't, is retarded and being blind to the truth for the sake of it.  then you are retarded, sorry that you had to find out this way.  
And that is not cause you think it is badass, but the fact you   
&gt;don't know what you're talking about,There is also no reason as to why the expect you to reach the temples in adult form, Sheik knows songs to teleport you, making you go there yourself is just mindless busy work.  
Especially the first 4, which are all in or immediatly next to areas you already visited anyway.  

In fact, the entire game is just mindless busywork, they should just make you fight ganondorf and eb over with it.&gt; If you prefer TP over OoT that's perfectly alright but I find the notion that TP isn't padded with unnecessary busy work ridiculous

I didn't say either of those things, thanks for putting words in my mouth with your funky-tasting fingers though.  

More like, kudos to Arin for finally FORCING Dan to do so.  they even walked past the entrance to Mama's caveIt means your fingers tasted funky, and you should stop using them to force words into my mouth.Brawl added Final Smashes,   
SM4SH added custom moves (but otherwise nothing that everyone can use)  

For one thing, the absolute most important thing they should add is a 4th taunt (absolutely no reason why both side taunts are the same, since they don't even decide direction you are facing after the taunt).  . . .  
Kinda wanna go look for this game in the second hand stores now.Maybe he could ask Sky to play for old times sake, unless sky is really set on not playing it anymoreNobody said anything about whether it was sexist, or only a thing with the females... etc...  
In fact, in the comment you replied to, I didn't even say it was an issue.  

PS: If you body is so burned that you are "coal", then you are dead.  
Same with their "her lungs are gone" reasoning.  
if that was True, she wouldn't be able to speak/hum cause you need air being pushed through your vocal cords for that.  Great news tbh.  
I could always use more for this game.  
Personally I would love an update for Amiibo support as well, cause I think they missed a great option with it.

I had a moment like this, but it was only for 2 rooms, was wondering what would happen in the treasure room.  
I think it should have the option for it (but with a Nintendo twist too it)  
But I don't think they should force every game to have it, nor strive to have games that don't need it/don't get anything out of it to have them.Could be you still get them.I got bored very quickly, but I expected that to happen anyway.  
I only really bought it to support a new IP.  

I would have remained much more interested if the singleplayer was better tbh, hoping they might make a singleplayer that isn't just an afterthought for an eventual splatoon 2 (spla2n)  

Lemme know when you do.Except, like I said before, within the seriesitself, there is a guy with the same thing, that is wearing full clothing.Did you even read this chain ?  

Within the series, there is another character with the same "breaths through skin" and he wears full clothing just fine.You'd rather it be an empty world with spots of "here is something" inbetween?  Same reason as that Wizzro's ring is "dropped" when you defeat it, despite it being it itself.    It's possible, but it is unlikely.  
With the whole : "eternal sleep" and the fact she was created for the explicit reason of fullfilling "the mission" that SS is about.  

If it happens, they will have to make an explicit reason for her suddenly waking up though, and they will either have to put her back to sleep afterwards, or have it at the end of a timeline and have all future games in that timeline using the master sword have her in it too.  (which I wouldn't mind tbh)She does that...That's like... pretty much half of all AI companions that are dead-pan about anything in anything though.TBF, Ghirahim is a demon that is turned into a sword by Demise.  
Fi is an "ai" mad eby hylia to guide her chosen hero.  

We don't know if Fi would ever have been able to become corporeal.Probably ALBW, simply cause of people unwilling to play with randoms (their loss) and incapable of getting friends together to play and nostalgia-bait thanks to A Link to the Past.But where's the fun in that?We don't know that though.  
All we see is that Ghirahim could be turned into a sword, and that Fi is a spirit living/bound to a sword.  

None of their other specifics are the same.  
Fi can't interact with the physical world  (or is never seen doing so at the least)  
Fi does not have arms, her clothes are part of her and can not do any magic, merely able to "interact" with objects that are specifically designed for her to interact with.  
Ghirahim has multiple forms, uses magic, commands legions of enemies, etc...  

It could just as easily be that Hylia decided to model Fi after Ghirahim after she fought Demise.  

It's possible they are "the same 'species' ", but it can just as easily eb that they aren't.Yes, she is only alive because of that, but that doesn't mean she "is coal" 
Nor does it mean the reasoning for her clothing is any more legit.  

&gt;Also this guy was just saying that MGS has always had fanservice like that both for its male and female characters, but no one ever lost their shit over the fact that you have to run around and cartwheel as a naked bishie Raiden in MGS2 while he cups his junk in his hands.  

and neither did I.  

&gt;It's obviously fanservice, yes. I just definitely don't think Kojima(Dude made one of the most compelling female characters ever in MGS3 for crying out loud) or any of it is sexist and people should calm the fuck down over this.  

again, only people that need to "do reasearch" (specifically of the : learn to fucking read, you imbeciles) kind is you guys.  
i never said there was anything wrong with it.  
People should just accept it for what it is.Same, I don't have the time (nor the interest tbh) to sit around waiting for Grumps to update at the exact time personally.This was a pretty shitty train anywaySome of these look more like pokemon tthen some from GF themselves, gj.I never said it is unreasonable, just that there is no proof for or against it (the curse of a species/character only being shown in a prequel) 

I don't see how it is unreasonable to think Fi ISN'T ghirahim\u2640&gt;You claimed what he said was False when she was in fact burned to the point where there's no way she should be alive under normal circumstances.  

No, i said that she wasn't coal, nothing more, nothing less.    

&gt;You also denied the possibility of her lungs being burned because she can still hum when there's a reason for her being able to do all that despite having been burned. I suspect that you might be the one that needs to learn to read.  

Give me one way she would be able to hum/talk without lungs that is explained.  
The "one that covers" has no confirmed powers like that.  

&gt;It's obviously done for fan service though. No debate there. Fact remains that there's an in-universe explanation for it, though.  

Yes, and that explanation is clearly an afterthought made up on the spot in order to have a reason for her to dress revealing.  His stand becomes more powerfull the louder he yells the obvious.He's better with it then[Ganondorf](http://fanboys-online.com/index.php?id=545)&gt; "Due to her injuries, the parasites compensated for her burned epidermis, giving her the ability to "breathe" through her skin rather than her lungs, negating any problems that could come from sway that could be the result of breathing too much while sniping, but also requiring her to wear as little clothes as possible, as covering her skin would suffocate her. As additional aid, the parasites compensated for the digestive organs she lost from her burns, enabling her to "drink" through her skin" - from the Metal Gear wiki. It's also explained in game.

None of that explains talking/huming.    
In fact, it does quite the opposite.
Yes exactly, it's a moot point, because the entire explanation was clearly just thought up to explain the outfit, not the other way around.  For a lot of people they still did.  
The circlejerk is just louder.It's his parasites that allowed for all the parasites in Phantom Pain.If we are talking Fire Emblem, there really is only one contender for [MOST BEAUTIFULL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw7RR7f2RSI)I think Nintendo is definitly the king (out of the "big" ones at the least)  
But I wouldn't say the others let it slog or anything.  

REFERENCES ARE SERIOUS SHIT GUYS!!!Yeha, in general I think way more stages should be taken from non-playable franchises.  
It's a great way to represent a franchise that doesn't lend itself well to a fighter/assist.  

I'm not sure if IS knows it themselves lately.Mario Maker is just more mario again, and survives completely on its nostalgia baiting.  

Splatoon is a new IP that just "clicked" with consumers.  

Very every game they marketted and did well, you can find multiple games they marketted as well, and that didn't do good.It's the genre mate.  
Splatoon is a colorfull, arena team-shooter during the era of shooters.  
F-Zero is a superfast (somewhat gritty/dark storywise) racer that most people don't even know what is going on in when they see it.  It's cause sheik is a male "character" being played by a female in-universe  

Imagine if Peach would cosplay mario.  
The character "mario" is male, but the "actor" peach is female.  

There used to be a big debate about whether sheik is male or female, but honestly, who gives a shit.Also make Rohan write in that he can not lie about his crimes when asked about them.  
So that he admits to all of them.Mor elike, they should make a blanca amiibo with blank face and some marker that can be removed but doesn't leave smudges.You can see why, imo.  
It knew what it wanted to do, and did so pretty damn good.  


Splatoon already captured people during the first E3 showing.Exactly.Doesn't really matter, if he admits to killing them, that's already enough.  
Not to mention he has murders from befor ehe developped his standLA is a direct sequel to OoXHis age is 1 higher then he was in OoTIMO : SS/BiS &gt; Dream Team &gt; &gt; &gt; Partners in Time.  

I did not like partners in time as much as the others, but the rest is very solid imo.  

PS: no one recognizes fawfull cause it is a running joke for Bowser to be forgetfull about everyone except Mario and Peach (green stache), Mario is forgetfull about all the tens of thousands of villains he fights on a daily basis, and thus can't really remember the sidekick and Luigi probably repressed the memory or something, who knows.  

on the side : Personally I'm looking forward to Paper Jam a lot.  
Especially if it might possibly result in Alpha Dream taking over the Paper Maio franchise *drool*
Cause the female's design is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much betterKamui is the only one that could happen.  

If I got to choose, I would take the ball-shapped dragon thing though, just for shits and giggles.&gt;think some FE fans may think in the mindset of "we have so many weapons in FE why are we only showing swords, that's not at all representative!  

Cause there are no important characters that don't use swords that aren't YEARS old by now.   

Sorry to bust the Hector/ephraim etc... bubble, but they are (shared) main characters from games that are over a decade old, from a series that already has 5 characters repping it and has much more recent characters.  

Only chance for a lance/axe user to get in smash is if the next (avatar) lord is one in its default/special class
Wario and Yoshi forght for different franchises.  
Wario his franchises sell better then over half of the cast, including the average fire emblem.  

Don't blame Mario for being succesfull mate.  

besides, if we want to pull that card : Fire Emblem has as much reps as LoZ, while loZ is infinitly bigger then new-age-FE is.&gt;You've forgotten Micaiah there, her game is the most recent unique FE game we've had before Awakening. She is also wanted by a lot of people because a light magic only unit could be awesome.  

"her game"  
you mean :"the game featuring her"  
Micahaiahalahgakjabitchhalah shares that game with Ike, and Ike is a much bigger part of the story, with mickahjajajawhorelkahaj mostly being there just to be a vessel for Yune.  
Also, ike already represents those games.  
If she was gon na be in, she would have been in by now, but she isn't.  (thank god)  
she is only a character in (part) of a single game, all other FE fighters have either been from the most recent game, or been multi-game characters (or honestly just Marth, who is the mario of FE)

&gt;You're forgetting Azura there. Along with Kamui she's the most likely candidate in FE to be added into smash if we were to add a new character in this very moment in time, I would say. They are the two most relevant FE characters of Fates and she is definitely important. 

I'm not.  
Kamui is the only one with a chance, if we need to pretend that anything from fates even has a chance  
Sadly (fot it atleast), it was 'born' during that awkward point after a smash game, where (in case of SM4SH) it is to young to make it in as DLC (especially since FE is already represented more then enough) and by the time the next game comes, it will no longer be the most recent game (most likely)


&gt;Even so, I know the issue, but we don't have to limit the cast to just the main lord. Chrom is more of a main lord than Robin and Lucina yet he didn't make it in the cast and they did. I wouldn't suggest Hector or Ephraim, it's illogical to do so, before Fates I would have suggested Lissa as an awesome staff/axe combo, and now that Fates is out I'd suggest Azura as a water/dancer/staff unit.  

He really isn't.  
Robin is the main character from Awakening in all but "forced character" in the maps.  
Everything is explained from his perspective, he can marry everyone, everyone constantly gushes from every orifices in on their anime bods about how great and amazing he is.  
Walhart just straight up says : 'And I would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for that meddlesome tactician'  

Chrom is a lord without a game, even more so then miciahaihalagahagidiothahahah, cause his best friend stole it away together with his daughter (unless it's his wife offcourse)&gt; Roy doesn't fit any of your criteria yet is still in smash.

Roy was the most recent character (well he was pre-recent even) when he was added into the series.  

Yes, Wario has 2 series that are completely shut off from Mario, and both of his series (although one is in a bit of a coma atm) sold exceptionally well on their own.  

I could see Yoshi, although again, he fights for a different series in-game all the same, but Wario is most definitly a fighter of his own series, and the wario series deserves to be considered as affliated, but seperate.Once you're in, you no longer need a reason to come back.  
Roy wasn't even supposed to be cut from brawl anyway, it only happened because of time issues.  He was somewhat popular in melee (he was the better version between him and Regular Mario) but they sorta ruined what made him differnet'better in SM4SH.  

I thinK Pichu is the perfect example of a cut character that isn't coming back.  
(also the only one from melee we really lost.  
Young Link is just Toon link now, and Dr. M, Mewtwo and Roy all came backthe game would have been a lot better if you actually went to the present areas and then had to go back and forth to the past , Oracle of Ages style.  
instead of only ever being in the castle during the present part and splitting all the past areas off from each otherYeah, so far my experience online has been perfect (well, on the player front atleast, fuck the hinox "don't pop any balloons" level, fucking stupid as shit)Well, Rohan could just make him admit to the killings without mentioning stands.    
just make him admit to his pre-stand murders and then admit to killing the other people, but never mentioning ay information beyond : "I did it"Hmmm, personally I didn't feel like it was a drag at all.  
just a bit less fun/awesome as Superstar Saga and Bowser's inside story.  
But, it is hard to top those games anyway.  The ones he did without stand would already be enough to land him in jail, if he then admits to the rest but doesn't answer anything else about those murders, it wouldn't really matter.She actually tried "reaching" for the little kid in the tree with it, when it fell, so I doubt she can't handle it if her reaction is to use it to catch something.  But now you know doubly soo !I thought his final smash was his die move ?Uses a taunt instead of recharging Sun or reapplying breath.  
The curse of WFT : Some of the best taunts in the game, never a moment to use them during the match.He has to rebuild his entire army every time Mario rampages through.  
Besides, not like the toads have anything that can stand up to even his log-armyHis die move is actually guardian angelHaven't had it yet myself.  
But personally I wished that if you used the cheering icon while wearing the cheer outfit, your icon would change to reflect it.  Doesn't change the fact that the yealry releases are clearly taking their tolls, just look at how many glitches and bugs each of them have had directlyafter release.Let's see,  
I have BlueYarnYoshi,Game&amp;Watch,Bowser,Ike,Dedede,Brawler,Olimar,Squid,InklingFemale,Samus,ToonLink,Villager and Wii Fit Trainer  

About 90 Euros  

Kinda strange to think about though, If they hadn't forced the horrible artwork poses onto the smash figures (horrible as in : bad for figure production) 
I probably would have bought them all, or at the very least every one that my friends weren't interested in.  

Maybe even continued with all amiibo's in general.&gt;GameSpot: Triforce Heroes is a very different kind of Zelda game. What drove the decision to make this so far out of the mold of what we might have expected from a standard Zelda adventure?  

Why do people keep asking : "this is so different from anything you've done with the series, what gave you the idea"   (this version of the question is actually still the 'best' version I've seen of essentially the same question)  

We've already had 2 of these types of games before.

PS: talking about FS and FSA, I really wished they'd make a FSA remake with the Tri force engine (or even better, a remake on the WiiU)  
FSA needs the remake way more then WW or TP ever did.Isn't the game's story set near christmas ?Seems like the attack of an enemy stand if you ask me.&gt; Bloodborne. Arin knowing what the hell he was doing in a difficult game and Dan being interested in coming along for the ride. Wasn't expecting it. Probably the biggest surprise of this year, besides...

It was especially surprising considering their darksouls ... 'adventures'It's ok man, you are allowed to be wrong in your opinion, even a stupid opinion like  that.^^^^^^jkTwo people one kart  
Specials  
Tracks with ACTUAL shortcuts/hidden paths, not just "driving over the grass with a mushroom" 
All Cup  
A **FUCKING DECENT BATTLE MODE!!!!**

So in short : everthing.Good to see they were able to take a picture inbetween running away from DIO and getting caught by him.This isn't really something for /r/Truezelda, this belongs more on /r/zelda.You could have gone for the Lego universe thingy, which is the fourth big "toys to life" series.Yes, but you do so through "online" and then "with friends" (making sure the other player is registered as a friend), then once they join, the host should talk with the 'sage' again and tell him to find a third player from the random players online.  Wouldn't she be even faster with a brush?It also helps that he is DA MASTANah, it's a collection of minigames.  
So far, we have seen 3 of them, a "Board game" , an island survival/escape (resource gathering and whatnot) and a quiz which even the most devote fans of animal crossing would have trouble with.  

On the current main menu, it seems that there are spots for about 8~10 things to select, offcourse it isunclear if some of those might be stuff like the shop (you can upgrade the attractions and stuff), settings, amiibo registration and so forth.True, the absolute worst for me so far was (like I mentioned) the "DON'T pop any balloons" in hinox mines.  
Every time, the newest member would take the kokiri outfit and rush for the bow, which makes the level impossible as you will hit the balloons 3 times as likely.  

Also, the time I finally made it through to the hinox bros. only to have THEIR bombs blow up the balloon 

Eventually I just did it with dopples.It is, the "problem" I have with it, is that most of the balloons are placed obnoxiously, instead of challenging.  
in the entire level, there is like a single (set of) balloon(s) that is placed on a way that makes you solve the issue differently.   
All the rest are just : "ow what's that, you fired at a slight angle from the switch ?!? START OVER", "Ow, you are using the kokiri or big bomb outfits ?!?" Well you are fucked by default now, START OVER", "Ow, you threw your boomerang half an inch to close causing it to go to far ? START OVER" etc....  

The reminding stuff is sorta useless, you have to beat your level before playing it, so levels where you need/want one, you'll definitly notice yourself.There is a difference between releasing a game that is "not finished" as in : is in an unplayable state  
And releasing a game, and then adding in cut content FOR FREE later on.  

Every game ever created has had cut content/features or stuff they didn't think about until it was too late.  
No reason to "chastise" a company for doing the right thing, which is : giving the content for free when it is done.  

Honestly, name me some games that got "chastised" for being released "incomplete" (incomplete as in : "completely playable and in a functioning state, while not missing anything that was promised", not : "Game breaking glitches everywhere, and missing content that is clearly advertised/etc..." ) and where people were mad for them releasing the extra/forgotten/etc... stuff for free afterwards.  

People aren't mad about this, cause there is no proof for this ever being cut on purpose and is stuff people wanted very much and it's free.  
There is no downside to this for the consumer, so there is no reason to grab the pitchforks.  

The LAST thing gamers should do, is start flaming and shitting on stuff when they aren't doing stuff wrong.

PS: 
&gt;
I didn't say "fuck them". I know, I know, one should not come to this sub unless bowing low before the unquestionable altar of Nintendo, which can do no wrong. Thanks for setting me straight, Reverend Fanboi.  

There are times when fanboyism should be mocked, but that was no fanboyism, that was sarcasm pointed at you cause you are being *silly*Or they didn't really think it was needed/didn't think about it in time, and after realizing the fan demand and their 'mistake' are like : here you go, thanks for the patience and the support by buying this game.  It should still be on the creator to think about the checkpoints himself, or after feedback.  
By asking about it every time, you create "navi/Fi" moments, where the game is being obnoxious about something you probably didn't even forget.  
Not to mention you imply the creator should place a checkpoint, even when it is not needed.I mean, you didn't forget in terms off : you know you don't have one, cause you don't want one in your level.  
I'm not sure whether the game can recognize some sort of "LAN" situation or something, but yes, you do connect through internet (so you do need to make sure both 3DS's have internet access)Slopes are a pretty important part of level design.  
It also became a bit of a running joke because the mario maker stage In smashbros  does have it.He means that causing the notification to play every time you don't have one,  would imply not using checkpoints is incorrect.Splatoon is the only one I agree with. 

This isn't nearly an "essential" part of the game, nor was it advertised at any point.  
But splatoon is already a giant nintendo circlejerk of nothing can be done wrong in general anywayHave you tried resetting your 3DS clock and then waiting for 24 hours ?It's TFH for people that don't feel like typing out titlesSounds pretty great, yeah.You only get "Friendship medals" from local/download play.then she turned when he wasn't watching and CHOMPSaid the guy calling other people names.  
And yet here we are, with the only person resorting to calling names being the "ooh so politically correct" /u/unbangermanbourbon.  

Also :  
&gt;
For as easy a game as this was to make- compared to making an entire game from scratch- I think it was a little anemic. And the word "unfinished" does get applied to games that aren't broken but just have half their content purposely withheld and/or not yet finished at launch. Now they're adding in what should have been there day one, incredibly easy stuff to code like "power block with 1 conditional statement".  

clearly no understanding of coding nor game design.That's just that specific jigglypuff (the one from smash)  
that ones has always had different colored eyes.&gt;(It worked with NSMBWii, it would definitely work with something like Pikmin)  

Except that Super Mario bros. sells multiple millions with every iteration, and pikmin not nearly as much.  

I definitly agree it would be fun (though I'd probably never be able to play it decently unless it also has online) but it isn't really a comparable case, as platformers (and especially the king of platformers : mario) are much more "accesable" then RTS's, even if pikmin is "baby's first RTS"Cause it is coded as a projectileYou can post pictures through miiverse by going to home &gt; miiverse and posting a picture of your screen.  
that said,I have posted pictures of the princess on all her locations (the black ghost) and the blue bird, and nothing seems to have change, I am now working on the dairy "picture hunt"  
&gt; I will name-call, without apology

doesn't this already say enough.Oooh my, big guy coming through everyone.  
Make sure his ego doesn't knock you off your feet.  

Tell me, is that sense of misfounded suppriority something you were born with, or did daddy have to whip it into you ?Off note : I did find out that you can put your cardridge into a different 3DS, use download play on your "normal" one and then get a free friendship medal from that.He steals all his vids from VideogameDucky anyway !Aw man, that's a coincidence, I just went to the yard sale of my sleepy mountain town and found [all of this](http://imgur.com/gallery/sneoW)So is Skyrim, and it is still considered an amazing game.Everything would be super-restricted in terms of platform design and whatnot, and it would all be relgated to a 3D-roster to place stuff in.  
only way to realisitically make it work.  

this is also the reason why a zelda maker is less likely to be made.  
Cause in general, the 3D zelda's are way more popular, and allowing for a 3D maker wouldn't work.  
(although the issue with pacing, item and inventory management, overworld and stuff and so forth would already cause a massive issue as is anyway)Cause she aint the avatar/main character.YesI'm just messing with you man.  

But if I didn't belief you(/or more correctly : if I cared at all), then a simple text message back and forth wouldn't really be "proof"  Why ?  
The suit can be equiped with concentration, don't really see anything wrong with that.Very nicely written out sequence, but I doubt Stone ocean will have a single season, it's to long for that.eeeh, I totally get it.  
Part 1 is intresting, but for someone just looking at it at face value, it is nothing that they haven't seen thousands of times.  
And the series has a bit of a slow start, which is good in he long run, but can definitly turn people away.   
I always say : "If you don't like Joseph's part, then you have my permission to stop watching, cause then it just aint for you""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."So, guess we haven't anylyzed the concentration "magic" enough yet.  

besides, don't really see how out of all the bullshit the power armor pulls, the concentration part is the weird one, we already have robotic limbs that react to your thoughts and "will" IRL anywayTurning into a ball roughly the size of twice your head at most makes more sense right ?  
Being able to store 255 rockets the size of your fore-arm into your suit makes sense right ?  
Being able to fire infinte amount of energy as an attack, yet needing random energy dropped from biological creatures to restore physical damage makes more sense right ?  It's confusing how they handle it tbh.  
On one side, the ones that went back in time were followed by grima, which is sorta illogical if there was no danger of him fading out of existance or anything.  
But on the other side, the future past DLC is a third "timeline" or alternate dimension from the ones our'army' are from.  

but frankly, who really knows what bullshit they'll pull out of their hat next, with time travel, alternate dimensions, outrealms, "my castle" and so forth, it seems soon enough we might as well get 3 golden fire emblems representing 3 virtues that give you a wish when brought together"and now I am the ded, bleh" - everyonePocoloco is a CPU only character that can't lose.It's amazing how fitting that is with Bowser's character.Or it is technology that surpasses what you can imagine.    

The suit exists, she just unequip and equips it by thinking about it.  
This is no different from the suit removing 'itself' at the end of super metroid.  

And are you really using star wars logic as reasoning for why something is considered magic or technology, but then follow up with : force is magic.  
So having infinite energy to shoot, yet using energy to heal your "shields" (which you can also heal by blowing yourself up in a fetal position) is "technology", but making your suit equip/do stuff by thinking about it (something we are already seeing (obiovusly extremely more simple) IRL ) is 'magic' ?,They never said any of those.  
You are pulling them all out of context.  
Smash and Mario kart especially never said : "no DLC" they said : "No DLC currently planned/being worked on at this point in time"Anyone that is  zelda fan and paid any amount of attention to the company could have told you they were gonna delay it before Nintendo even considered it.  [I thought this was her theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od3cjyHctjo)&gt;Do away with Magic Three Hits. More-recent Zelda games have been better about this.  

I partly disagree with this.  
While it obviously shouldn't be a "rule" and should not be done for everything 
The simple 'fact' is that three hits is a very acceptable and good/fun amount of times to do something.  
4~5 tend to be repetitive, and 1~2 often makes it to simple.  
Well harder could obviously be done by making them stronger/faster or making them "counter" your strategies.  (They did it very slightly with Beast ganon eventually dodging your arrows if you try to fight him in human form)  

But honestly, I don't think Twilight Princess is the game to really consider "more interesting" for.  
IMO, the bosses in Twilight princess are all very memorable, cool and fun, with the exception of Blizetta, which has a great "intro", but the shape/form of the boss is very lackluster. (it's just ice shapes)  

Some of the mini bosses could do with better versions, but then again, it's not really the mini bosses role to be amazingly memorable /They should have weapons based on Lucy's keys, and the auqarius one breaks when it becomes un-sharp ....The rule of three doesn't only apply to bosses like that often times though.Argarok required the boots as well.    
But aside from those two, It's essentially just the most recent item and Zant/ganondorf which didn't have items in their "dungeons".Not really no, it got great scores and reviews and is loved a lot.  
The "hardcore" elder scroll fans find it lackluster in comparison, but it is a simple case of being more accesable for new fans, and many people who played and loved skyrim never played the other elder scrolls  

It is one of those games were everyone agrees on what it did wrong, but people simply don't care and still enjoy the gamea lotCanon, with one n.  
just like ganon&gt;
They didn't say no new 3DS models? Wrong. Miyamoto specifically stated that they were satisfied with the 3DS and then two days later they announced the 3DS XL. Satisfied = OK with current model = no new models needed.  

LOL, no let me redo that ***LOL***,  this is classic case of consumers making up shit they want to hear.  
He said they were satisfied with the 3DS, sure.  
but that doesn't mean they can't make different models for different consumers.  

Thinking : "we are satisfied with it" is the same as : "no other versions of the product" is utterly idiotic.  

&gt;
They never said they weren't going to make mobile games? Wrong. Iwata was adamant about not creating mobile games as it would decrease the value of main series IP. Decrease IP Value = Damage Nintendo's Image.  

This one is actually more of a re-wording of what was actually meant by the article writers and interviewers, not the fans, so I'll grant you this one partly.  
Iwata stated no interest in joining the mobile market for short-term gain at the cost of long-term gain.  
people took this up as : "WE WILL NEVER JOIN MOBILE CAUSE MOBILE SUCKS AND WE DON'T"  
But in reality, how it was meant was much closer too : "We won't just start dropping our main games on mobile for a quick buck, if we ever join mobile, it will be on our own terms and in our own ways"  

&gt;
Saying that DLC isn't planned or being worked on means precisely that: No DLC.  

It really fucking doesn't.   
"NO DLC" int he way that you clearly took it, as you consider it a "lie", means they were never gonna have DLC for those games.  
All they said when asked about it **BEFORE RELEASE** is that no DLC was planned/being on worked on ***YET***  
They never said it was something they wouldn't do for those games.  

See, there is a difference between "reading between the lines" (what you *think* you are doing) and grabbing some crayons and writing in words/meaning yourself.  (which you and the other drama fans love to do)No one implied that HalHe is "bad" in the way he is the "bad guy" and the "villain" and he accepts and even takes pride in this.  
Bowser has never tried reasoning his actions as a "good thing that comes over as bad", but all his good actions he has always explained as doing them so as to be able to do more bad later.  

He did not set out to save Peach's voice for the good of the kingdom, but so that he could kidnap her without wrecking his castle.  
He did not save the mushroom kingdom from Dark Bowser, Instead, he made sure that there was a kingdom left, for him to try to capture (also, dark bowser was ripping off his style)  

Bowser takes pride in being the villain, he WANTS to be the bad guy, he KNOWS he is the villain, and he owns it.  
That is why that moto fits him.  Yes, I was referencing the triforce.No, it's ganon with a single n, the mistakes made in the original nes games are irrelevant to what is his intended name.    
  
And as we all know, the CD-i games are not canon (which like mentioned above, is also written with one n)

You mean, the lack off one ?  
Or.... I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be seeing here.Except it does.The fight was... ok.  
If they had to keep the design like that though, it really should have included climbing on top of the "sculpture" and hitting the immediate area around yeta instead of just hitting the big piece of ice in general or something similar.  

It is least memorable fight imo though.  
I always remember the temple and the yeti's but actually need to think what the final boss was again.Well we do know what would happen if he was in the [Left 4 Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd4a1aHzv2Q) versionFrank (and the player) doesn't know yet, all that happened is that you happened to have met Carlito, who was seemingly aware journalists would be coming and mentioned that you were the only journalist to make it and now he was suddenly shooting at brad.  

The rest of his story gets explained later.People who are smart enough to realize this sort of thing should not be encouraged, as it effects the industry in the long run.  
This sort of silly emotes should be free/be an extra with something else at the very least.  

You can say "people should eb allowed to spend their money however they want", and you are right, but that doesn't mean we can't be annoyed at what idiots are allowing these developper('s bosses) to get away with.I actually think Brawl is a better example.  
Everyone agrees that the story mode was only really good for a single playthrough mechanically, but everyone still loves the cutscenes.  

Melee is more like, the game people accept as being competitivly better, even if they themselves don't play it that way/prefer a newer version.Knocking Samus out does not automatically dematerialize the suit, it is more like, when her mind wavers all over the place.  
It's not that she needs to control it existing at all times or anything, just needs to summon/un-summon it, and when she goes into PTSD mode (which I did find .... wrong, but is not directly a result of the idea that she controls aspects of it with her mind)her mind is too chaotic for the summoning 'algorythm' to know what to do.    

Physically removing the helmet could still be cause summoning it is an all-or-nothing deal.  

Also, even if knocking samus out would remove the suit alltogether, it could still be that the x that infested her system and her suit had already started taking over parts of her suit/causing malfunctions, thus preventing it from going away.  
One of the rare moments the series shows (and more importantly. reaches) its potential for being good.Except it could still be something else I'm not seeing.  
I did ask if it was the lack of one, I fail to see what is so confusing about a sentence a three year old would understand for you.  

Maybe you just saw something arrousing and the redirected blood caused you brains to not receive enough blood?
I'm gonna go with that explanation, yeah.
I actually completely forgot what subreddit this discussion was in until your comment...The break in concentration thing is a different issue from it just equiping by wanting it.  
besides, there is a bit of a difference between "simple break of concentration" and "PTSD/panic attack"  

I do agree the fact that the panic attack unequips it should not be the case, but that is more another strike on the Panic attack issue then the concentration issue.  Nice.  
Wonder what will be shown off.  

After the skullkid reveal, I am somewhat hoping/expecting that there might be Termina maps and a short post-story segment for MM.Oooh no, my one weakness, people noticing my mother tongue isn't English.   
*flashy explosions*  
AAAAAAARGHGod's work, that's what.Ooooh, big guy pulling out the re-card.  
Unexpected move, and with that I mean, so obvious that even my stillborn twin brother would have seen it coming.Wowee, another *original*.  
Color me purple, smack me on the butt and call me Tiffany.You mean that Hytopia is part of the Light world?  
Or have we someone been able to figure out where it is located in comparison to Hyrule?They didn't mention that Ganon was taken over/fused with yuga in ALBW...  
Personally I would place some games a bit differently in the era's/compared to the events explanated but aside from that it is a pretty decent timeline.There is a "zelda conspiracies" subreddit ?!...  
Is it like... this sub but without people pointing out mistakes on flawed theories or something??  
(well aside from you apparently)I am actually.  
But only with good body paint, none of that cheap stuff.  
Bonus points if it smells nice.Gomess got in but not Death sword?    

I mean, if "reaper look" scares you, then what about something that is invisible at first except for his weapon, was sealed with like a hundred sealing tags and that has a goat-skull for a head,which is common symbolism for Satan.  

Gomess just looks goofy if you ask me.I disagree.  Then you probably missed some previous games.They also did this for the Splatoon Testfire and splatoon is inky gold.Probably not.  
But if it is locally you want, you can just use download play.Seeing that Dunkey replied to his comment,   
filled /u/cyanfrosty with determination (to keep living)&gt;
You have a horse, named after Epona  

While they did call her Epona, it will probably be a "Link" deal again, where you can choose the name like in TP.  
(be prepared for another ten thousand "I washed *my dick* for you" jokes)Change is neutral, like almost anything.  
It depends on what they change.Yes, but with Yakuza it was specifically stated that he was chosen/contracted for a year to allow for enough time to look for "new blood" for the position (IIRC)Sakurai doesn't work for Nintendo though.Wouldn't mind that much, Mr. Shibata is a great host.   Nah, they will bring back the "wii would like to play" guys, and go around house to house, exclaiming the wonders of "The Big N"I couldn't tell you which AAA games were in each month's directs either, but I could easily name you like 25 indie game they showed in the directs.There is only a difference because of marketting though.  
Without information, both are just "retro-y indie games"  

They pushed and helped shovel knight a lot, which helped with its succes (offcourse the main reason for its success is hitting a nostalgic market with a game that is better then just nostalgia bait) Who the fuck accidentally punched you in the dick because of your momentum ?!?Did you really make a novelty account for complaining about a guy sharing fanart about the right subject ?I don't know about the Anime, I only watch the fight scenes afterwards, but I read the manga.  
In general, the series has continued as it was.  
lot's of lost potential on : "LOL natsu so strong, one-hits this legendary god that nobody could summon for the last 500 years" moments again, but moments like the scene me and the other guy were talking about are where it shine.  
(those moments do annoy me afterwards though, cause they just show how much potential is lost with a lot of other arcs and story elements, imo atleast)  

Either way, I think that if you liked it before, that you will probably like it now as well.True, although funnily enough, before "hero of art/lorule/fasion/totems" his two games, it had been since the ORACLE games that anything was added in the fallen hero timeline...  
Strange to think about.  

That said, I'm pretty *'sure'* Zelda U will not be in the fallen timeline.Most likely, yeah.  
If it was a different dimension or something, it would be the first time they didn't make any sort of 'big deal' out of it in the story/even mentioned it.  

Legend of Zelda : The Wind Waker  

There really is only [one answer](https://youtu.be/Y3Y1lbG0HkI?t=6m51s) for this question.Differnce is that that Samus artwork is reused.[We actually saw part of that Link render before](http://imgur.com/a/DskuA)But now it is worth BILLIONS!!! POP THE CHAMPAGNE, DRINKING TONIGHT BABY!Ya can't proof anything !!!  
(i totally did)[We actually saw part of that Link *look* before](http://imgur.com/a/DskuA)  

Edit : said render when I meant we saw artwork of this look/graphical style already pop up.Sorry, I meant we saw that "artstyle/look" before.  
This "TP link with SS graphics" look.  
[My B](https://i.imgur.com/Cxnrj9k.png).I haven't gone over all the patens in great detail, but don't you think they might make the NFC touch point be on top of the screen like on the New 3DS ?I had a whole new slew of inside jokes with half of my friend circle, followed with mad ravings of : "FUCKING WATCH IT ALREADY !!!"  

Also, attack rushes can now only ever be seen with inside-head-audio of : ORA ORA ORA/MUDAMUDAMUDA,  
and in smash bros. : Gold captain falcon is now Za warudo, Yellow Bowser is Dio, wii fit is a hamon user, and Sun salutation is Hamon Overdrive  
And Landmaster has turned from everyone yelling ["LANDMASTAH"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBFDBlUpJ-0) to everyone yelling : ["ROAD ROLLER DA"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRTIwDbmVzM)  They also used mariokart DLC as an example fo ways to keep released games fresh for longer in a different meeting, and  nothign came out of that either, I wouldn't get my hopes up.Triforce heroes.

Maybe Dunkey could also play Sky in smash some time.  The heads of each company were all very nice after Iwata's death, and congratulated the NES on it's 30th birthday a little time ago, etc...  

The days of "Genesis does what Nintendon't" are long gone (and even those were more to rile up the consumers then each other)

E:wordsProbably not.Are squids known to be ... "clean" ?  
I mean, they look like they are covered in mucus in most depictions the average person would see them in, so Iwouldn't connect "clean" to squid tbh...Totally unrelated, but :  

&gt;\u1559(\u2609\u0a0a\u2609)\u1557 SQUAAAAK \u1559(\u2609\u0a0a\u2609)\u1557  

For some reason I can't place a different noise on this but : [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLguForuh4)And hyrule warriorsTBF, mariokart DLC did amazing too and those didn't get anything beyond the 2 sets that were announced immediatly either.&gt; TBF, mariokart DLC did amazing too and those didn't get anything beyond the 2 sets that were announced immediatly either.

This has always been this way, and yet look at the state of "fanservice" comparing NoJ to NoA/NoE  
I mean, NoA and NoE mostly 'demand' the same characters, so the number is even bigger, and yet, lookat what we got throughout most smash iterations.  

Personally I don't care, in fact, I think they should listen to the japanese fans even more, if that increases the chances for Tingle getting a promotion from AT in the next instalment.
Don't agree on the way you are bringing it, but I do agree on the notion.  

Shovel Knight isn't just a very young, non-exclusive, third party ip that isn't an "icon" or living legend from gaming history, but it hasn't even been released in the place they make the game...  
Hyrule Warriors, Pikmin 3, Mariokart, Mariogolf.I think it probably is based on money gained from it.Classic Riot Games move right there.They were sold with a bundle discount  
But that doesn't mean they couldn't have made more if they wanted.  I wonder if we might see the return of the Stopwatch to allow for such abilities.Miyamoto is the "everything" guy for me.  
He essentially created or played a pivotal role in like over half of the steady franchises nintendo makes.  

Aonuma is definitly the "zelda guy" though.  
And Koji Kondo is the "Zelda music guy"  

Although I definitly expect Shikata to become a more prominent developper/leader on the zelda front.  Just rule 1 already says enough about the content there I think.

&gt;**No more Link's a Stalfos posts, and no more Link is Dead theories. Do you not read Hyrule Historia? We get it.**Link went into the Lost Woods in MM, and became a Stalfos and helps Link from TP.But the real question that remans is : what instrument will we have ?!?  
personally, I want god damn Tesla Coils !!Or it could totally not.  
The game didn't even make it over there, so I doubt the amiibo will be there very soon.[**YIAN KUT-KU !!!   
EAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLguForuh4)I don't think Cawlin is that exceptionally short.  
Especially since he could still be pre-puberty/growth spurt.  

Oshus and Cole ( [And all the Lokomo aside from Byrne](/spoiler) ) I am not counting as they aren't really humans, just human-like.   



I'm doubting whether to count Koume and Kotake, as they are not only following "shrunken grannies" logic it seems, but also are hundreds of years old, and their bodies are probably more magic-based by now then their actual bodies (also, their fusion is this giant woman, so not sure what to take from all of that)Groose is really big though.  
Compare him to pippit and link and he is small, sure, but not "dwarfism" small.  
shut yo mouth fool, gamepad is the best thing ever.Right, how did I miss him. 
thanksNot really a big spoiler tbh...  
No different from saying : ["Ganondorf is a Gerudo"](/spoiler)Well guess we are different on that aspect then.Done.True, with changing seasons doing minor changes to the stage, or with a rift which shows someone doing stuff in the past on the background, altering the present where you are fighting.Chibi Robo's game is also released here...  
And I didn't say SK will be region exclusive, but I doubt it will release before his actual game releases over there.True, but those were free, so they aren't "competing" here (nor would they be part of Nintendo's sales report)Something like the gamepad doesn't work "optionally", cause then games wouldn't utilize it well/be forced to find ways not to utilize it, cause else you have more idiots complaining they need the "optional" controller to play a game.I mean, it is no different from saying : [Link is a hylian](/spoiler)No different from saying [Epona is a horse](/spoiler)It's no ["Link uses a sword"](/spoiler)And it even spawns a new one if you still have one.Wouldn't say Deadly creatorues is that much of an improvement over ALBW."Link turns into a wolf"Cracker launcher isn't in SM4Sh though.There is a difference between : "not AS known" and "game (still) hasn't even touched japanese soil yet"  But his new game has, which is the one the amiibo works with.  
And so did the original game.  

Sorry dude, but no matter how you swing this, the two really aren't comparable.  
NOT TO MENTION : you are comparing chibi and shovel knight on basis of amiibo, but it's not like chibi has made it into smash or anything, even with his amiibo.[Darksoul in summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9x_koRZ2bA)Exactly, japanese characters got in despite having no presences across the rest of the world.  
And guess what, they were actually planning on REMOVING them for the western releases.  

That's the entire point, bruh...  
A character that isn't known in japan won't make it, cause Japan is where it is made and where they listen too the most.  

Think about it this way : name me one character that made it in that was asked for by western audiences and not at all by japanese...   
Only one that really fits the bill is Little Mac, and he got a promotion fromAT, which role eh got thanks to his classic status.  

Shovel knight is not comparable in the least.  
He is Third Party  
Not a legendary icon  
Not Nintendo exclusive  
and hasn't even reached Japan yet.It only does because it releases seperatly on handheld and consoles.  

Either way, sakurai himself has already said he can't keep the team together forever, and the team are Namco employees, so it is not like they have no other potential projects to move too or anything.  
it's not like this team's only potential is making smash games and smash DLC.  

Either way, I'm not saying we will only get a little bit of DLC with no chance on much more or anything.  
but it isn't just cause the DLC did good that we are guarenteed to get more until it dies out or something, as there is precedent for it not happening like that.&gt;Sure Pikmin 2 had the annoying caves

you go wash your mouth this instant young man!  

.

aaaanyway, no, I don't pikmin should strive for difficulty, in its "regular" playthrough.  
It's not really what they strive for with the series.  
Asking for difficulty in the series is like asking for it in LoZ imo.&gt;. They're not doing 3rd version directors cut games anymore since B2W2 changed that.  

it was different one time, there is no guarentee they wont go back on it.Nah, this could easily mean nothing.  
Wouldn't be the first time they did thisWell to each his own, but imo, ALBW is great except for the moments danny refuses to explore/solve things on his own, which really aren't that prevalent as people pretenI'm just expecting the biggest of : "what the fuck, how could I have known to save those people" moments coming up.Mostly the times where Danny remembers a alttp reference or is amazed by the merge mechanic.I just come to this subreddit which has someone linking to a re-flipped version anywayMain story is pretty simple :  
Princess is cursed, go adventure through all these places so you can un-curse her.  
Essentially as simple as LoZ I and II  
No sages, no plottwists, (beyong maybe one of the NPCs being the "villains" sister)

There is some fun little background stories and "scavenger hunts" to figure out, but it is definitly a gameplay focusses game.  

Like /u/Areallylongsnake said, it is essentially a side story, even more so then MM/PH.  
Most likely, it will have zero effect on the rest of the series story/lorewise.  
With the closest thing to an effect it has, is it having the first reference to the Kokiri in the fallen timeline.     
(or even the first direct reference to them since OoT)It's good unless you are someone who can't stand them fucking things up/ignoring shit (they essentially let the NPCs that act as the tutorial on saving people die...)Just next level distraction strats.But there is no reason those people wouldn't play just as well with a regular one.  
So the fact they use that one is still a gag.Length is unrelated to difficulty.  
And people have been "complainign" about the difficulty in LoZ since OoT or even before, still nothing.  

These games are meant to both appeal too and be enjoyable by, *"everyone"* so that includes people that aren't good at them but are drawn in by the visuals or whateverThey put in a lot of doubles in order to make the amount seem bigger it seems.Sadly enough, in a way, yes.Cause (good/worthwhile) diffuclty is not something you "just" add in with a couple of changed values.  

And balancing everything so it is fair/works and then bug testing everything on every mode and so forth would severly increase the time needed to make the game.  

Especially for pikmin, where you wouldn't even really be able to "double damage and HP" (which is the cancer of "difficulty setting solutions")for the enemies or anything.In general it is both 'great' what Araki did with Jonathan, and horrible.  
On one side, the entirety of part one was essentially the "prologue" to the DIO-joestar connection and what a legacy it is.  

but on the other hand, Jonathan still had so much potential....And that's why I bought it.  
Just for people like you.  [Here you go](http://i.imgur.com/u7WSL9H.png)excuse the sass, couldn't resist.It's only a single "reference" to them, but essentially the first one since OoT that is by-name.  But is your hope powerfull enough to overcome mine? cause I am hoping it is just about everything except Linkle.I'm somewhat hoping for, and expecting, that there might be some Termina arena's and possibly a brief post-story for MM as well (just like WW has)  
It would round out the 3D zelda's, and seeing as they added in ~~Majora's Batteryboy~~, ~~lesser~~ skullkid I could see it happen.  

Aside from that, hoping for the,Groose to be Loose, or possibly Medli to be added.Cause Linkle is a fucking stupid idea for just about any reason people could come up with as to why she is "needed"  
The more controversial stuff will depend on how much magic pixie dust the treehouse team manages to ram into the cartridge.  Cause the Groose has to be LooseI really don't see what is wrong with it.  
if this was any other game, the title "heroes of light and dark" would sound cool to the average person.  
I also fail to see what is confusing about it, it is enormously obvious the title refers to how "Kris" is the 'shadow' of Marth, which the history books forgot about cause he was merely a shadow.  
(Kris is XoF confirmed)  

If it was localized it would have probably just been "Fire emblem : Heroes of light and dark" without the new mystery part, which is a reference to the original game anyway.&gt;More traditional games  

.

&gt;awakening  

choose one.Mot like the other traditional fire emlbme games thoughNone, at this point in time.  Actually, it just means Tecmo Koei wants to show the trailer, like it has done every time so far.It's cause it is da best.&gt;Also, from the triple-split timeline (Child/Adult/Downfall), we know that a 'new' Hyrule (and by extension, its corresponding Sacred Realm, Lorule, Termina, Twilight realm etc.) forms when a significant event happens.    

Quite the opposite.  
From the existence of the trident timeline, we know that NOT every action creates infinte amount of alternate versions, cause otherwise there would be no reason to specificy the three.   
The very fact we have confirmation on 3 specific ones existing, means there is NOT a multiverse going on.  

&gt;But there is a place, a sort of idealized location, that fits at the corner of all of these Hyrules. This is Hytopia. Hytopia is a mostly untamed 'version' of Hyrule, that has not dealt with such horrors as Ganondorf or dark interlopers. Its resources are plenty, and easily accessible, to the point where the general population has no worry of what tomorrow will bring, and is focused solely on vanity. It truly is a utopia. Its as though all the good things from Hyrule fuel it. Now, Hytopia has no triforce. It has no need for a triforce. Its ideal, perfect. Why would you need a reset button in a perfect world?  

This is completely unfounded.  
Hyrule during Twilight Princess shows signs of being "uncaring" about the situation, or more specifically, that it has only started caring recently.  
because the twilight invasion was mostly behind the scenes, and before that, they had had a large section of reletive peace.  

It seems to me more like Hytopia is a country that got a combination of an easy history, and the one time they did get trouble, it was solved by the totem heroes, and presumably those three also got connected with "style"  
Thus, as they have only a single legend to call their own, their entire "identity" as a nation resolves around it.  

.

Many of your other ... theories... are completely without any reasonable basis, so I find it hard to really engage in them...  Probably an issue with the server then.  
I'm assuming you are NA?  

I'm from PAL and everything was just dandy today (except for being connected to the same guy like 5 times, and each time his connection died halfway through a dungeon)Lady Maud also has some pretty decent "bring to life" or "subjugate" magic (her pets) and teleport/summon magic, I might add, so the fact that their clothes are merely (specialized) magic is clear enough.  
Not like we haven't seen "magic" clothes before anyway.  
Blue and red 'mail' are both defensive, goron tunic lets you walk through lava, zora armor/tunic allows you to breath (although this could be a "technology" more then straight magic), etc...  

Nice picture of your dual plane concept.  
Personally I still think each dimension (or atleast most) are more like the twilight realm/minish cap in your example, with each being a dimension connected to the primary light world.  
With lorule being the exception of having it's own sacred realm.  
But there is indeed no direct reason as to why it couldn't be seperate countries/places/states of the same dimension (especially since we have only ever seen 1 version/timeline)
PS: I assume the Dark realm is the one where the general "demons" come from ? (Demise's world?)  

Since we are talking about placements of the different countries and stuff anyway.  
I got this idea little while ago 
(and obivously it has more off a development history reason then an actual lore on)  
but considering Oracle of Seasons was gonna be a remake of Zelda I, and it's map has some clear inspiration from it, with most notably, the first dungeon being exactly the same...   
It could very well be, that Zelda I takes place in Holodrum (after holodrum is joined with Hyrule as a single kingdom and then taken over by ganon, causing people to flee that ruined "hyrule" portion, towards the rest of the country. (The rest of the Zelda II world).  

Just something to think about.

Strange.  
Although I haven't heard anything over it so far.  
It's the same for LoZ I, where the idea is just that "thousand monkeys with a typewriter will find all the secrets we hide in this map" and tell their friends about it on the playground.  

It's pretty strange to think about the fact that with the information highway that is the internet becoming essentially videogamer/geek culture's capital, that this experience actually died out, instead of flared up.  

But essentially, now people can just look everything up with ease, so if a game goes : "brn every bush on every screen" we can just go : nah man, google.  That's just cause Araki essentially forced us to not care for him though.Only thing I dislike about the singleplayer atm is the time challenges.  
Only tried a hadfull, and I think some of the other ones might be more forgiving if you know what to do, but the ones i tried so far aren't very fun in singleplayer cause you are just wasting time getting everyone to do what they need to do and stuff.  

Definitly think the amount of time recovered from clocks and/or given by default should be higher for "dobbel" playthroughsYou mean adventure or regular four sword ?  

It's not as great as FSA's single player in terms of "ease of use", as there is no "call everyone here" button and you can't use formations, but some of the levels' puzzles work really great. and if it isn't, it should be, cause what they are using isntead if often garbage.He is definitly one of the best ones.  
I also liked how he (and his neighbors the gourgheists) brought another type into ghost town.  

But Froslass is still a better ghost though.He doesn't, cause he only talks to sailors.
Wait... wrong circlejerk sub...ERB is as much a duo as gamegrumps is tbh.  Nope, just that.

Edit : as far as I have seen atleast, but I doubt there is anything else in there atm.Yeah, regular Four Sword was definitly not made with the idea of sinlge player in mind (which is logical since it had the A link to the Past remake bundled with it)  
Triforce heroes is definitly more fun in singleplayer then Four Sword.  
(and the fact you have online means you don't HAVE to play singleplayer if you don't feel like it)&gt;To add to who you replied. I think this is the most kid friendly Zelda. It's simple and the story wil make kids giggle, especially with the use of memes. As a 26 yo guy, I don't like it. Not because it is kiddish (I fucking love Kirby and Yoshi's Wooly World) but because it is really the most simple Zelda written and I kinda don't like the specific memes/phrases they use.  

NA translation must be pretty different from PAL then...  

Also, I'm pretty sure Zelda I and II have about as much "story" to them as Tri Force heroes.It's just a zelda that focusses on the stuff that is less to you, no big deal man.  

IMO it is has some great item uses, teamwork, puzzles and the icons make team work just amazingly fun.  
The music is also amazing, and it is just a very unqiue experience, even compared to FS and FSA.  Green,Red and Blue link is all irrelevant,the Link you play as in town (blond haired) is ALBW Link, and when you go online, you play with "2 other guys/heroes" and each of you take on a color.  
Otherwise you use 2 dobbels to transfer your soul too.I cri evertimSure there is : The resources spend on making her, an "OC DO NOT STEAL" character with no reason to be in, could have been spend to make... litterally any other character  (or item/moveset/weapon/area/etc...)that actually comes from the series.  

Also, in general, having no good reason to exist, IS a reason for her to NOT exist.Pretty sure it is a combination of the two.True, but I considered that part of the suit.That would require them "taking back" the Adam.I. being on her side, which I doubt they would.Well in that case, I honestly don't see how you could say "no memorable characters" to WW, and then say OoT was better.  

OoT didn't just have the most one dimensional cast in the series (for the 3D games) but even its Link is just bland as fuck.  
With the only emotion he ever shows being : "HURRAY, FOUND SOMETHING" and "GASP, THAT DOOR CLOSES BEHIND ME !?!"  

For a lot of people, the exploration, style, feel, etc... is what made WW so fun in the first place.  RivenXZac art in my feed....  
&gt; 25+ comments  

oooh good.... People bitching about stupid shit again cause they can't stand the idea of people liking something they don't.The AI is based on Adam, but probably still had to come to terms with it and was still coded as an AI, essentially using his Adam parts to over-ride his "do everything we want of you" A.I. coding.  

The game straight up tells you it is Adam (to be precise, an A.I. based on Adam) at the end of the game.You sure he said that ?  
Never heard it before.  

When would it even be relevant ?  
Was he playing Marco Polo with an infant ?How would this be a splatfest ... there are way to many options.Your backstory in Zelda II is : "OG zelda (who isn't even CLOSE to actually being Zelda 'the first') got cursed, go place crystals in all the temples to unlock the big temple so you can get the ToC and 'fix' her.  
There is no surprise in the story.  
No side characters that matter for the main story, no hijacking by any villian, no secret plot in the background, no reveal about something, etc...  


Essentially as much as Tri force heroes.  
TFH also has some snippits behind every area, and some characters with some history/'story' behind them.  
But in general, it is just : Princess is cursed, go through drablands to find/catch witch, then beat the witch to save her.  

Both tell you what the goal and story is at the start, and at the end nothing has changed at all.Why wouldn't he have mentioned that once he was A.I.dam then?Not to mention that, even if we need a "female Link" for some reason...  
then how about we add... a female Link skin, so that female link actually has the same weapons and options as "Link"  

&gt;
To be fair it was pretty damn ballsy to kill off your main character, especially since he had supposedly won.

Definitly.  
That is also part of the amazing "legend" part one is for the rest of the series, but sadly it did come at the cost of giving Jonathan more story.  

&gt;
Also remember without Jonathan dying that Lisa Lisa would never have had the chance to become a ripple master, or meet Jonathan's son, and then Joseph and everyone after him would never have existed.  

Well this is "hindsight 20/20" in fiction you know, there is no reason why character Lisa Lisa couldn't have been given a different reason for reaching the point her character is through a different path, etc...Even then, the restriction would be immense.  

It most likely wouldn't work as well.Exactly, cause you are fucking biased and a bit of a piece of shit.  
You would BAN something cause you don't like it ?  
Despite it breaking no rules?  

That's retarded,  
A lot of people dislike Futa, should we start banning those ?  
A lot of people find Yuri disgusting, let's just ban those.  
you know what, fuck it, lets just stop this subreddit.  

Thank god people are smart enough to keep people like you away from modding powers.  Eeeh, unlikely if you ask me.  
I doubt they will want to remove A.I.dam

Besides, if they really wanted to have the S.A.X. survive, they probably could just say that one of them using an escape pod or something to survive.WW has a lot more characters, that list is extremely incomplete.  
Hell, following the fact that we are even including the most limited characters from OoT like the kokiri and town  people, then just the ruto and Koroks would increase the character number way up.  

Most characters in OoT have only a single reason to exist, and never change anything about their personality.  
The sages are essentially noteworthy of essentially have way less character then they could have.  
Saria's only personality quirk is that she is your childhood friend  
Ruto only has the fact she is a tsundere  
And when they become sages, it's jsut like :"poof, sage now" ow ok, guess this is my existance now.   
etc....  

In windwaker, many more characters have some sort of (small) character arc.
I agree with you 99% **BUT**  

&gt; I played through WW and immediately started a new playthrough. Why? Because I wanted to play the entire game and beat Ganon in pajamas.   

they aren't pajamas....  
they are jus this regular clothes...Hey man, that's just DK's special.  
Yoshi can use his eat-seaking egg to catch up.Lol yeah, the people that are raging are the ones that don't mind the content ?  
Sure pal, only people starting this same old tired shit over and over is the people that can't stand there being a bunch of RivanXZac like your sorry ass.Well maybe people should just learn to accept fap material existing that isn't for their dicks.I'm assuming NA ?ow right, this was a thing in japan.Friendly reminder that [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/2gbctz/hi_what_button_do_i_press_for_the_final_smash_in/) is still our most upvotes thread ever...I spend a minute trying to see what was wrong with DHD and ROB before I noticed they were a threepack.Nope, personally I don't share this sentiment that the intro isn't a (True) "part of the game" that a lot of people seem to feel.  
Especially in TP and SS, which is long, but does a lot for world/setting creation imo.  

That is called Identity theft.if you know what to do/following a guide, not very long.  
But if you are going in blind, you might be spending quite some time on having to re-do parts in the cycle and whatnot.  
Nope, it's directly after ALBW.  
It's the same Link.Nope, they meant timeline and lorewise.It is a boss, yes.Kyogre is discount low-quality wailord.  That Mario is pissed.Nothing compared to how a 3d one would be.  
At the very least, you are able to recreate the entirty of super mario bros.  

PS: there are very little levels in actual mario games that have water in a regular stage.  
What they do miss,  is being able to go above the water in water levels.Yes, like I said, cause the internet makes it too easy to ignore looking for them yourself/buying a magazine for it.  What we really should be flaming them about, is their horrible choice in wanting to be a battery for an evil mask !! ^^^^**/jk**Nah, clearly it was cause he was flying in a German plane, and German science IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD !!!Rare 'footage' of [Serb](/u/serbaayuu) angry... (at something that isn't lore idiocy)Don't forget the king who's tear ducts have the power to create rivers !!  

Personally I find it a pretty charming town tbh.  
Reminds me a bit of Port Town except with more focus on fasion instead of greed.Download play allows for up to 2 people that don't have the game to play with you, it will even create some memory data so they can keep the money and resources they gathered.  
However, they will only be able to make 2 costumes.  

Also, I'm not 100% sure, but I think people using download play will have the 8-bit music without wearing the 8bit  outfit.  
Or at the very least have a chance to have it happen.

Local play is just allows you to play with your own file and stuff.That's one of the 3 places/moments I keep a dedicated save file for. 

The others are Zant and Ganondorf battle Feel like we need a sequel to ["Just glue some gears on it"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFCuE5rHbPA) called : "just wear bronze figher pilot goggles"I doubt we will get closer to "western" setting then TP did.Only one that has a lobby system and is related to Zelda I'd assume : "Tri Force Heroes"eeeh, dunno.  
Marble is much more aesthetically pleasing than Bronze imo.She saved the animals and spared the baby metroid, presumably because it imprinted on her.    

Althoug both of those could still easily be done because of her big sense of rightousness more than anything.  

Child Samus is pretty damn cute in the backstory manga though.Halloween is a lot less of a "holiday" in average Europe.If it aint there, it aint there.Yeah, though I'd have to say, if they had added the online back in, I would have bought it on the WiiU.  
I loved the multiplayer mode.  
I sorta hope we might get more side modes like them in future games.  
Was also pretty sad to learn about Tetra's treasure trackersIt would either have to be like that, or have a "story" like in Zelda I and II (AKA practically none)I'd probably be pretty dissapointed.
Story NEVER grabbed you ?  
Like... not even during Midna's Lament or the credits ?  

I mean, it's ok if it didn't offcourse, but I fail to see how any of the other zelda games could have ever grabbed you if those scenes in TP didn't.  
Pretyu much yeah.  

A game where it could partially work would be one in which all the seperate civilized species/races/tribes/etc... are seperated very far off from each other, and you need to get a gem (or whatever magufin we neeed) from each of them.  
Although then we reach the issue with ALBW's way of doing temples and we get very limited temples and shit.Don't worry, soon enough we'll have a costume that allows us to see which chest we should pick, that'll be usefull for us right ? XDWon't really matter for me right now, I have like 15+ of every material already.  
I might actually start wearing linebeck myself and showing others where the good stuff is.Would be stupid as fuck imo.  

Not even because of the idea of a female Link, which I don't feel strongly about one way or another.  
but the fact is would be Tecmo's little "ORIGINAL CHARACTER DO NOT STEAL"   
Might as well start adding Coldsteel into the next sonic game.I fail to see how making a character change gender for the sake of filling a checklist is being progressive anyway.  

PS: when are we getting Black Link, Native American Link and Ginger Link.I miss the time when characters were able to have meaningfull relationships (and as a result endings) with each other without having to get married and having a child with some retarded reasoning as to how the child is fighting in your army.  you could just do like everyone is doing so far and vote based on what we have at the time.Mia's mom probably.  
Though none of the moms have really been that amazing in terms of whether I could stand living with themSeems like it is a torn bootyshort.AFAIK, once.Can i just kill 3 times instead ?This is higher production value than the average YGS and YIAY  
but his sketches are like this or better.&gt;plz make doujinshi of her being swallowed by Like Likes kthx  

actually already saw that on lostwoods  

Either way, seems the same on both sides.   
More people going "why?" over there then I would have thought.  
I assumed the so called "demand" for her came mostly from Japan.&gt; I mean, it's ok if it didn't offcourse,

Gamefreak's characters are blank slates though.  
Link hasn't been a True blank slate for years. I need to say the same thing to myself whenever I catch a coelacanth, or other high prize museum object, the first time on a character.Your school has no sunbrosthey should have done a lot of things for the singleplayer.  
This is indeed one of them.When people ask if a game like MP:FF, TFH, MM and so forth is a "spin off" they don't ask if it uses parts of another game.  
They ask whether it is considered part of the main canon or not, and whether it follows the "standard" of those games.  

It is everyone talking about video game series's definition of a spin off.  

Examples : Mariokart is a spin off series of the mario series.  Majora's Mask is not a spin off of the Legend of Zelda Series
Name me any moment where a pokemon character from the maingames has a character defining moment ...  

&gt;While we never hear them speak, people will often remark on their personalities, how they're clearly a trainer who understands the power of friendship and such

that doesn't mean anything about the character though.  
That is just what they imply about the person playing.  

THey have almost no moments like the Links have when they go and stand in front of zelda, or when they have a look on their face like they are about to rip ghirahims fucking head off and shit down his throat.  
They have no emotion on their face beyond " I won, hurray"  
Red doesn't even speak when he is no longer the player character (unlike the one time we meet an old Link : Hero's Shade)  

They barely even do stuff on their own except run back to a pokecenter and follow someone who is leading them somewhere.  

Link is far from as blank a slate as the pokemon characters are.  
Other characters constantly remark on what he is saying/requesting on his own.  

The closest thing to Link that the Pokemon games have is the Colloseum and XD games.
Could be Nintendo has the rights to the "polygonal head"  version of him.  God I want this so bad.It's the lucario that is immediatly infatuated to you though, not the other way around.  
You character really doesn't do anything special   

And even if we count it, it's still a single expression of (vague) emotions as opposed to the Links, that have gotten many over the years.How many men and where ?A god descending from the heaven to say something is the opposite of a character showing emotion though.  
it is the game forcing emotion onto the character, but the character didn't show it.  

No pokemon protag from the main games has had moments like [this](https://youtu.be/qrcQnugPpYk?t=1m14s), or [this](http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4tqk4lBXJ1qm8nv9o2_1280.png) or even [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WmvSSf3UolE/maxresdefault.jpg)  thank youSomeone pointed out the fly on his head during the "OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!" and now I can never not see it.I doubt characters with more forms will even get those.  
Let alone the alt. colors.wow, they have Nightshade in there?  
Does that character prefer it to be night ? in the shade?Oh, I wasn't even really talking about the female thing.  
I mean, there is a ton of different reasons why adding Linkle is a retarded idea.  
I was just saying that GF's characters are far from Link's current standard.The thing is that "character" doesn't mean anything in pokemon.  
the game could work with anything as a character, even a robot.  
they essentially are just robots anyway.  

Link has actual personality to him beyond some dogdude "sensing" your good intentions.  
Also, making him a female is not the same as "adding" linkle.I'm not.  
I'm talking about GF having no actual experience with anything beyond "characters" where the specifics have no meaning.   
Gamefreak has not made a protagonist with an actual personality in the main pokemon games yet.  

Their advice stretches as far as : "make a guy in a lab coat ask the gender they want to play as " and "Make the other character be their rival or neighbor or whatever"  

CHoosing a gender in pokemon doesn't mean anything.  
So I fail to see why you would even need to ask gamefreak for help  
what they have done with the pokemon protagonist is nothing.  

There is nothing to be learned from gamefreaks way of handeling it.Sounds like you are ignoring what I said based on a simple mistake in my comment.

I'll say it nice and clear then : GF has nothing of value to offer on the subject.  
[The yoghurt is also cursed !](http://i.imgur.com/LRWHxFy.jpg)Lots of people are born with different colored hair on different parts of their body  
Not to mention the simple answer of hair dye.&gt; ~~But seriously that demo for~~ the last mystery dungeon is unbearable...

Looks like there will be missions that reference the previous games.  
It'll be nice to see team ACT againExcept they don't have anything to add, cause literally all they do with their characters is change what the people call you "hey girl/boy over there"  

Legend of Zelda actually has more experience in meaningfull change based on situation/status/looks with just the Majora's Mask transformations and stuff.  

Pokemon has never had any sort of meaningfull change added in by having a female option.It's great for people playing with friends though.I find it funny that the time they make the main lord an avatar, is the one time he/she is doing shit I can not relate to in any way.I removed this as it is not actually related to SmashHEY BUDDY, PET MY ASS !Her addition itself is stupid imo.  
no matter what the reasoning is behind why we suddenly needed her inclusion, there were better options.Pokemon was already supposed to have a choice of gender during the first gen.  
She is even in the booklet and art.I'm with you man.  
Still can't fathom why&gt;Here I am using spells from past Zelda games as examples. Which spells Nintendo has decided to design to be put into the game is a fruitless discussion until more spells are revealed. The time slow feature is the only spell we have seen.  

We haven't even seen whether the time slow is a spell or not. 

.

I doubt all amiibo will be supported by Zelda U.  
I think it will only be the LoZ amiibo.  
I also think (and sorta hope) that the amiibo will be relegated to a side thing, and not be connected to a story item.  
I'd expect it to be more something like a shop in town or something like the Nintendo gallery in WW (position-wise I mean, not functionwise, although them unlocking little figurines or something would be cool).    

Edit : Also, the quest idea would make me legit mad, as it would for many people.  
Doing that means the game has like 100+ (if all amiibo are supported) on-disc quests that are locked behind physical 13 dollar/euro "keys"  
Even if it is just all the Zelda ones or whatever, you are locking away content.   

Just with the confirmed zelda amiibo so far (and you know we will eventually get more), that would mean you need to pay up 78 dollar on top of your 60 dollar game.     

Edit 2 : Guys, don't downvote thread just cause you hate Amiibo intergration.  
Let's instead make this thread a legit discussion "hub" about it.    
Even if you don't like it being a thing, that is still a thing we should be able to have a discussion over.Personally I've been pretty split in their implemantation.   

I think HW, MK8, SM4SH, YWW and SMM did it good.   
But I think the way it works in splatoon is a bad sign.   

The main issue with them is that they will either be just really small little skins and stuff that doesn't really justify the price you pay for them, if you aren't buying them for the figurines  
or they will essentially be physical keys for CD-locked content.  

They already confirmed some form of amiibo support, as the Wolf Link &amp; Midna Amiibo will work in it.  

The question is WHAT it will add, and whether whatever it is will be unlockable without amiibo/be insignificant.    Quests and shit are definitly important.  
They would be locking away content for those little figurines.  

What they did with Splatoon was already a step in the bad direction, they better not do so with Zelda U if they want to keep a good rep on their amiibo functionality.  

The spell idea or whatever is pretty small key (anyone worth half there salt won't use something like that anyway).    
But locking side-missions/quests behind 13 dollar physical keys for ON-disc content ?  
That's messed up.  

edit : 
&gt;~~Sorry, but q~~uests and shit are definitly important.  &gt;&gt;**I doubt** all amiibo will be supported by Zelda U.   
**I think** it will only be the LoZ amiibo.     

&gt;Also, they only said Twilight Princess uses exclusively Zelda Amiibo. They haven't given any details about Zelda U Amiibo Support except that the Wolf Link Amiibo will allow data to be transferred from Twilight Princess HD.

I didn't list any story items in my examples. I listed side quests, and cheaper spells. Neither is a story item. They are more like buffs and challenges.  

side quests are important parts of the game.  
Any form of gameplay is.  
I can see little stupid "cheats" that can be used once a day being a thing, not like it is a big deal.  
but fuckign sidequests ?  
no way.  

That would legit piss people off.  
In what way is that different from microtransactions to unlock shit or something ?  
answer : it isn't.    

If the game was already out and they were like : we are adding support for these amiibo by adding these things.  
Sure, somewhat acceptable.   
But straight up locking them away on the disc cause I didn't buy every one of them ? (I would have if half of them didn't look so shoddy originally)
Nope, wouldn't even accept it if they shipped a full set of amiibo to my house.&gt;In response to your edits, the quests would be repeatable, and they wouldn't be in keeping with the game theme. They might add things from other games. They wouldn't normally have a place in a Zelda game at all.  

that doesn't mean shit though.  
The fact it is in the game and on the disc makes it part of that world and more importantly : part of the game.  

&gt;More importantly, the price tag for the quests wouldn't be 13 dollars/euros a piece. You're getting an Amiibo to use in multiple games, but a single Amiibo can only hold save data for one at a time. In other words, you keep your save data for Smash, you unlock the costume in Mario Kart, the costumes in Beyonetta, the weapons in Hyrule Warriors, and the quests in Zelda U. You would be purchasing it for about 3 dollars/euros for each of those games, totaling 13 dollars/euros.  

Irrelevant.  
if I don't want any of that shit and I don't want the figurines, but I want to play what is ON THE DISC I PAID FOR, then I need to pay 13 per mission.  
As simple as that.  

Imagine if you had to go eat a happy meal in order to unlock quests in the next zelda game.   
But all the mcdonals in your area are far away and you don't even like their food?  
THOUGH LUCK, OTHERWISE you won't get these special missions.  

&gt;the costumes in Beyonetta,   

those aren't amiibo based.  

&gt;
In other words, your Amiibo do more than JUST unlock those side quests, and you only have to pay full price once. I already have Link and Zelda. Whatever they do in Zelda U, I'll be ready without putting any extra money down. 
 
well isn't that just great for you.  

many people don't, and have no interest in the little moneysinks.  
I have like 9 amiibo and even then I wouldn't accept straight up shoddy practices like this.  

&gt;You would be purchasing it for about 3 dollars/euros for each of those games, totaling 13 dollars/euros.

even if it was only a CENT per mission.  
it would be ONE CENT TO MANY in order to UNLOCK CONTENT THAT IS ALREADY ON THE DISC.I'd say the spells example isn't that bad.  
It would be comparable to the Kirby amiibos in canvas curse/rainbow paintbrush or whatever the claymation game is called.  

The sidequest one is straight fucked though.That would be slightly less bad.  
But it would still be questionable at best imo.  
You are still locking the experience of infiltrating the mission with ... I dunno...  tiny deku toads ?? behind a pay wall.  

&gt;I enjoy sidequests in Zelda games.  

As an example : 
MM was all about the sidequests.  
nobody gives 2 shits about the giants and skull kid.  
but Anju and kafei, saving the ranch/milk or gibdo dad, that's where it is at.  

imagine needing pikachu in order to get the keaton mask... *shudder*sorry, meant Midna.  
Wolf Link and Midna amiibo.  

I had "Imp Midna" in my head, but when I decided the Imp was redundant I removed the wrong part it seems.In what way would the spell example result in that?Wouldn't that also be the first we'd get a link travelling through hyrule twice.  (IIRC we are confirmed to be in hyrule)  
And also : be the first time a Link passed the age of 18 (since there is no way in hell it would take place within the same year as SS)

&gt;it means we'll get optional Skyward Sword controls!  

I fear SS controls won't really shine without enemies/puzzles designed around them though.  Well Zelda U already has confirmed amiibo functionality atm anyway.  
I'd say the spell thing is probably one of the least invasive things it could do,  

it would at least be trully optional.  hmm ?True, fairy idea is essentially just another example of "getting a small powerboost"  

Frankly, unless they severaly update the difficulty compared to the last 12+ games, I won't even be compeled to use it or even ever come in a situation where I would need to use a fairy like that.  

Music could work yeah.  
WW is my favorite.  
But I Like all the zelda games, though Alltp is probably somewhat near the bottom.  

I liked the start the most.  
And the bigger bosses that looked pretty awesomeMaybe cause it felt like having a face DAD!  
Stop being so close minded.Saw it coming.  
people were panicking thinking paying that 70 dollar was the only way to compelte their colelction.  
Meanwhile anyone thinking about Nintendo's wallet was certain there would be reprints as soon as there was a "need" for them.  

Nothing that sells that well doesn't get a reprint.They are trying to send in spied under the radar.  
Good thing you were on top of the situation.Top reason it isn't : it aint no origin.Linear with potentially extra chapters that are optional.  
Branching path linear would also be interesting, though they never really explored that beyond the twins' journeys of sacred stones.  (which also had non-linearity)  

In fact, non-linear imo is a break from the actual gameplay.  
IMO, fire emblem gameplay is defined by more than just being a "tile based turn based strategy rpg"   
Saying that is all that is required in order for it to be the same gameplay is like saying every game that has paltforming plays like Mario.    

IMO, a big aspect of "True" fire emblem games is the potential to be royally fucked.  
With which I mean, if you end up losing all your strong units, and didn't train all your units strong enough to be able to hande the final boss, you are essentially forced to start the whole journey over.  

IMO, it adds a somewhat "rouge-like" feel to the overal game.  
Even if it is obviously not really "rouge-like" because of many reasons.  

So not only would I say I prefer Linear, I'd even go as far as to say that non-Linear might as well be defined as spin offs as far as my opinion goes.how long until we have hacks of the game to just replace everything with Jontron."less bad than horrible" can still be bad.  

people shouldn't be expected to buy figurines (whether you find them nice is irrelvant as that is subjective) in order to get the full enjoyment out of a game (especially one that isn't build with them in mind.)Let's be real here, the first trailer was rendered in-engine.  
but there is now way in hell that wasn't a scripted up the wazoo event.  

It not being in the first teaser means pretty little for its chances, it could have been an item they didn't want to show yet, or one that originally didn't show up on your model, etc...Bruh, the facial expressions is what makes Windwaker the perfect precious game it is, and I will fight you over it !As a Belgian... : We did ?!this is super sad and stuff... but also so funnyOur entire armada is there !!&gt;My theory is Ash is becoming less of a beginner/intermediate trainer and more of a strong, independent trainer. We all know it ends with Ash winning a league. Or not(but that's for somewhere else).  

I wanna go into this here quickly, simply cause I ussually miss those other threads when there actually is any talk about it.  

Even if Ash ever wins a league.  
That still means nothing.  

Winning the league in the anime world just means you are that years winner.  

The elite four and champions are still MUCH stronger opponents that can't even be compared to the normal competitors.  

Ash won't (or atleast doesn't have to) stop travelling just cause he wins a league tournament.Well yeah but that was obviously made around the idea of using his name to begin with.  

But it could be when they did, they just copyrighted the "polyshima" as a character based on a person or something.But that's the thing.  
They would be rewriting what is currently written ther, even if what is written there is only a vague legend retelling.  

Dunno, I think you just sorta challenge them when you meet them like Ash has done so far.  

I don't really thing there is something like a gauntlet of E4 members to defeat or something in the anime.  It could become a thing.  
Haven't really had time to talk about it on the mod team AFAIK, considering how new it is.  Well TBF, it is missing our one little liferaft which is our navy.In the anime, the E4 and champions are insane.  

Just like the legendaries are.  
A legendary in the anime doesn't just lose unless it is against a different legendary or a very well trained pokemon that is using a good strategy, and even those are always very clutch victories.Strongly disagree.  
A game "focusing" on multiplayer is no excuse for a lackluster singleplayer imo.The "will you wake me up this time sleephead" scene...  
Dear god, and I thought Midna was able to pull heartstrings.Loved her.  
Not sure what you mean with people not caring for her (beyond the hate for SS in general cause it requires some level of bodily control and awareness the average person is apparently missing)  
Most of the time I see good things being said about SS it involves people saying they loved the Link-Zelda relationship and interactions.  

Personally I really loved it all.  
The crystal sleep scene is amazing on a series-wide scale, and only ever overshadowed by Demise "creating" the connection between the triforce trio.  

I liked that she clearly was trying to get Link, the (somewhat) good for nothing, to try his best instead of just taking everything for granted, because she cared for him and stuff.  
I liked her playfull teasing, the superclose near-kiss only to push you away is very cute.  
Her appearance was also really nice and down to earth.  

**MAJOR** step up from Twilight Princess' bland "might as well not have been there" Zelda.  
(pretty salty we got miss *"personality"* for Smash again instead of the SS Zelda or something, that said, probably should have been smarter and just not really expected any zelda love from Sakurai when it comes to fighters)The level design in the singleplayer that weren't just temporarily witheld arenas were super lackluster imo.  

The lacking freedom of the worst galaxy stages combined with all the personality of a factory warehouseI never thought HW ganon had a chance simply cause it was too late.  
But I was atleast expect a single newcomer or something.  
Or atleast an overhaul of Falcondorf or ToonLink* or ANYTHING really.  

.

*I was actually hoping more for a Link overhaul while keeping Toon Link the same, simply because in Brawl I found the moveset to fit better with TL than with Link mechanically.my main problem with it is that they just threw potential away that is clearly there.  

I much rather have gotten a storymode in which you ink your way through 3D platform levels with a sort of SM64/sunshine/B&amp;K/DK64 progression of the level than just walking straight paths with more straight paths at the end that are hovering inside of big spheres.I see Jojo "references" everywhere now tbh.  
&gt;
Link has one stat that increases

Several games have you increase your HP (heart containers) attack dmg (sword upgrades) and defense (tunic upgrades)  have they shown off all the MON ?  
Or otherwise all the "one-offs" ?  
I think it is somewhat likely those will be used tooI disagree on the TP part.  
Even when everything is solved, she still comes over as just this cold zloof person who is only half aware of what is even going on around her at any one time.  

My favorite TP Zelda moment is when Ganondorf took her overhe doesn't dislike melee...

he hates what "you people" have been doing to his game.He did celebrate it, even despite nit liking it.It aint no Knack BAYBEE!Nah man.  
Pokemon Silver is way better.  
It has slugma in it and shit.eeeh, some people prefer their games to be games, not movies.WHAT ?!? but what about all the LADDERS ?!!  
Did you get to experience the [THRILLING GAMEPLAY](https://youtu.be/tTsBn36yPrg?t=1m39s)I was just being silly mate.  
Implying that Sakurai even gives a damn, either positive or negative, about people playing his 14 year old game.  

Besides everyone knows his real masterpiece is Air Ride.You know, I KNOW this is just "typical gamegrumps"  
but how come did they end up reading ALL the text in ALBW (which is essentially mostly useless gameplay wise) but didn't even read the control pop ups for this game where neither of the two really remembers what to do....  

Could be that was the point he was supposed to join at.&gt;Are there any sort of anti-discrimination laws where you are that prevent a prospective employer for denying based on gender?  

lets be real here.  
I know this is an overused "but muh equality" reaction or whatever  
But people don't care when a man is discriminated against, or atleast not in situations like this.  
I think you are lining up the melee communities feelings too much with sakurai.  
From Sakurai's POV, Melee is (probably) no different from Brawl or SM4SH.  

I'd say he is (or in the long run will be) more proud of Brawl's Story mode and cutscenes and SM4SH insane line up of quests than Melee's longlevity with a very select crowd.  
City Trail world championships.  
Grand Finals  
Both players complete the Hydra and the Dragoon at the same time.And 5 seconds of reading at the start/off camera is more interesting than bumbling around for 5 episodes yelling about how they couldn't possibly have known how to do something or cause the game didn't tell them, right ?I don't even need it to be HD.  (not big on this trend that just shining up graphics is enough to sell a game at (near) full price again)   
Just give me an airride port with "faked" online multiplayer and I'm set.TrueSharpest game in the series is not the same as being the best.  

It also was before SM4SH was made.If you can't get your eshop to work, you could probably look online for place that sell codes.  
I buy my eshop credit like that and it is so much less of a hassle at times.  
Sadly the site I use is for PAL region, so I can't help you with that.His real masthapiece is Smiff Smiff Wild 2aaah, good old second best oracle villain"there's no mushrooms in this level right"  

honestly, that's what is the stupid shit about these "sort" of challenge levels.  
they are super specific, often rng dependant and they essentially make you replay the entire level each time instead of giving you a some straight up mush.  if you are a manga reader, I can also definitly advice you to continue reading the jojo manga after you are done with the anime parts that are out now.  daredevil comets aren't as hard as some of the things they pull in these levels tbh.  
Not to mention you already practiced/played the regular version in that caselet's be real here, the fault is just as much on Arin as Kevin, for the simple fact that "the boss" needs to be able to have real talk with his employeesI'll keep my whacky eyes on you mister -.-&gt; 
&gt; Besides, they need to give players some motivation to actually buy these figurines, if the amiibo only let you switch up the soundtrack or something I doubt anyone would care enough to buy them

well that is already the main issue for the amiibo.  
They are skylander figurines without a skylanders game.  

They are only little bonuses in all sorts of games, but if they start locking important content behind it, they are essentially turning them into paywalls.  

I've had lots of moments where I was like : "Man, it would eb cool if scanning X amiibo or Y amiibo would allow you to do all this cool stuff"  
but then I realize that is only a good idea if we were to assume a situation in which everyone already has all the amiibo.  

For example, for Zelda U, I had a quick showerthought about how scanning the amiibo could unlock an extra "memory" of a boss fight or something.  
Something like scanning in ganondorf would allow you to play the ganondorf fight from TP in Zelda U.  

However, that idea falls through once we look at the fact that would  be locking a quick redo of a fight behind 13 dollars.  
etc...  

Like I said in a different comment, I've been pretty split on th
